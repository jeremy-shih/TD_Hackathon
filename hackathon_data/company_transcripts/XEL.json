Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. ","Paul Johnson ","Good morning. And welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions.","This morning, we\u2019ll review our first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. As you\u2019re aware, there are slides that accompany today\u2019s call available on our website.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain for looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.","And I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Fowke","Thank you, Paul, and good morning.","Today, we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share, compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives.","So, let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.025 per share, or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step-up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio.","We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wins that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process. In Colorado, the Commission approved our Certificate of Need for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on constructive settlement which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case, after the project goes into service.","Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be completed in June, on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our Crowned Ridge III project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.","In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans to achieve an ","80% carbon reduction by 2030 and 100% carbon free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue to clean energy transition while providing reliable service and keeping the bills low. Legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders on various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector.","In Texas, there are bills under consideration that would provide the right of first refusal on new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and points to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.","In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed into law by the Governor in March. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we're well-positioned to meet to the 2030 milestone.","In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantified our plans to achieve a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option, and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protections. We\u2019re proud to be leading the clean energy transition and support these bills which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives, and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states.","I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they work through the polar vortex and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bob and he will provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans.","Bob Frenzel","Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone.","We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include high electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes, and riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.11 per share, and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share.","Please note that we calculated the EPS deviations for both years presented, based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25%, following the implementation of tax reform.","Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales increased 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use for customer. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter, as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer.","For 2019, we're still anticipating relative flat consolidated electric sales, which reflect some discrete known declines and large customer usage, and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019, reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads.","Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million, reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs, and the timing of plant overhauls.","Over the last five years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk aversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M standing in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cybersecurity and reduce systematic risk in our operations. And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers.","Therefore, we\u2019ve raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels. We expect to offset the impact of the slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan.","Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico Commission, resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51%, and increased the ROE up to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. Revised orders expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million, effective in March of 2019. We believe this is a constructive settlement and a sign of progress in New Mexico.","In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico this summer to recover our investment in the Hale Wind Project as well as other SPS capital projects, and Minnesota in November.","With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. There is constructive legislation that's being considered in our various states. And we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the update you gave on O&M, which obviously -- I think you've been saying you expected to go back to 2017 levels, now you're saying just down 2%. But, that would still put you at 2.3, roughly, in aggregate. So, which was the run rate you were talking about last quarter? So, just can clarify, are you talking about more of a structural uplift, some of these customer experience investments or are we really sort of increasing one area and saving elsewhere?","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean, I think, it's -- first of all, I guess, I would say, Jonathan, we are ahead of plan, and that's a good thing, despite the additional O&M that Bob described. We continue to take out costs out of our business smartly. But, we're reinvesting some of those cost savings into things that I think are really important for our customers, and improving the customer experience as part of that, reducing systematic risk in areas of cybersecurity, gas safety, proactively implementing best practices for wildfire risk. I think, these are things that are important. And we're putting a little more money in that than we originally planned. When we look ahead to 2019 -- or rather 2020, I think, you can expect us to keep O&M relatively flat with where we end up in 2019.","Jonathan Arnold","And your comments on, despite the higher expense, still being in the guidance range, are you -- is embedded within that comment that you're skewing a little lower in the range than you might have otherwise been or am I reading too much into that?","Ben Fowke","No, absolutely not, Jonathan. We're ahead of our internal plans as of right now.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our second question from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","First question, there's been some opposition to the Mankato acquisition, as you filed for approval for that. Can you just give us an update and your current confidence level of getting that approved?","Ben Fowke","Yes. Ali, it's not really unusual in these sorts of situations for the department to have negative comments, not only with us but other utilities in the state. But, I think what you'll find and if history is any guide, is as we give the department more information, so they can better model the customer benefits, you start to see the comments be more supportive. We believe that this is of great economic benefit to our customers. I think, it's an important asset for us to own for the long-term and we ultimately think this gets approved.","Ali Agha","And the timing I believe is June or so, is that right?","Ben Fowke","Yes. I believe that's right.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then, also, can you remind us, currently, what's the regulatory lag in the system? And have you reached a point where the rest of it is just structural, or is there any further improvement potential...","Ben Fowke","We\u2019ve achieved the 50 basis points objective, Ali. And, there's some opportunity for improvement. But to your comment, you\u2019re starting to get to the point where we've got -- most of it is structural lag at this point.","Ali Agha","I see. And then, last question, apart from calling out O&M being maybe slightly higher for this year than budgeted, are there other movements in your basic assumptions for the year, either positive or negative to be aware of? And just specifically on O&M again, I don\u2019t know if I picked it up, but what kind of incremental spending are we thinking about this year versus what you had previously assumed?","Bob Frenzel","Hey, Ali, it\u2019s Bob. We've had favorable weather through the first quarter and favorable sales for the first quarter. So, we think there's some benefit there to offset some of the higher expenses that Ben mentioned. We also have an expectation for slightly lower interest expense through the that year than we\u2019ve given original guidance for. And as he mentioned in the previous question that we are above our internal forecasts for the year. So, we feel confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our range.","Ali Agha","Okay. And Bob, just to clarify, you\u2019re talking about O&M being down 2% versus \u201818 as your base assumption for the year? What was it before that, just to give a sense of how much it's changed?","Bob Frenzel","Yes. We've been guiding to flat to 2017. And so, the guidance -- we're probably 2% above \u201817 levels or 2% below \u201818 levels of guidance for \u201819.","Ali Agha","I got you. Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frenzel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.","Bob Frenzel","It appears that there might be -- let's take one more call.","Operator","Yes. We do seem to have another question that just joined from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ben Fowke","Julien, we could never not let you get a question in.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, sorry. This is actually Richie here on Julien.","Ben Fowke","We\u2019ll see you later, Richie.","Unidentified Analyst","Just had a quick question on the Texas rider legislation. How meaningful is the improvement in regulatory lag there as that legislation passes, given the Sagamore plant is coming online in 2020?","Ben Fowke","Well, remember, we already have a settlement deal for our wind assets. But, I mean, look, it's helpful. I mean, it's helpful as that system continues to grow on with really good sales. I would expect that we're going to need more generation, potentially both fossil and renewable. And that's a great thing to have along with the rider for the investment and the smart meters that we're looking to do. So. It's going to help. And, again, I think the environment in SPS is getting better.","Bob Frenzel","Hey, Richie. It's Bob. Just to add on to what Ben said. We're expecting to file rate cases in Texas and New Mexico to support the investment. We expect our Hale wind farm to go in service next month -- or sorry, early June. And we'll put those into rates almost immediately, based on the settlement mechanisms that Ben mentioned. In addition to the wind, we\u2019ll also get the rest of the capital in Texas in time -- in service in more real time. And that's all part of the wind settlement agreement. I think the AMI and the generation, potential riders that are working through legislation would further increase as we seek to do AMI and additional generation in the next decade.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frenzel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.","Bob Frenzel","Thanks for participating in our call this morning. And please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22532":["Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 24, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul A.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments, discuss 2013 and 2014 guidance, as well as update our long-term earnings growth and dividend growth rates. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our web page. We will also post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on our website.","Please note some of the remarks made during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. In addition, today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings.","2013 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share reflect a $0.04 per share charge as a result of August 2013 FERC decisions regarding certain fuel and cost allocations at SPS. This issue relates to complaints by parties dating back to 2004 and 2006. These orders resulted in a refund liability for prior periods and consequently, we took a net $35 million pretax charge during the quarter. Details of this order are found in today's press release and 8-K, which we filed in August. Management believes ongoing earnings, which remove the impact of issues and charges related to prior periods, like the refund liability associated with the FERC orders, provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, the comments on today's call will focus on third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.77 per share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, thanks, Paul, and good morning. Today, we are reporting 2013 third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.77 per share, a $0.01 per share decrease compared to $0.78 per share we reported 1 year ago. While weather was a $0.05 benefit this quarter, it was even greater than last year's third quarter at $0.08 per share. On a year-to-date basis, ongoing earnings are $1.65 per share compared to $1.54 per share last year. And while the final rate case in the Minnesota electric case was less than expected, the combination of favorable weather and management actions have positioned us to deliver 2013 ongoing earnings in the upper half of our guidance range, and this would mark the ninth consecutive year of meeting our annual earnings guidance.","We're also initiating our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05, which Teresa discuss in more detail in a few minutes. As you may recall 8 years ago, we announced our EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%, along with the dividend growth objective of 2% to 4%. I'm pleased to say we met these objectives on both the GAAP and an ongoing basis. During this time, we also improved our credit rating and our operational capability. As we look beyond 2013, we see EPS and dividend growth targets of 4% to 6%.","Now the components of our value proposition have changed, we remain positioned to continue to deliver an attractive and competitive total return for many years to come. We are in the process of updating our capital forecast, and we continue to have excellent opportunities to invest in our utility operations. We will provide more clarity on our updated capital plan, as well as our plans to continue to reward our shareholders, at our Analyst Day in December.","I'd now like to share a few recent operational successes with you. On our second quarter conference call, I discussed our successful storm recovery capabilities in Minnesota. Little did we know that those capabilities would be put to a test again so soon. In Boulder on September 9, it began raining and it didn't stop till a week later. Officially, 17 inches of rainfall, with certain parts of the region receiving over 20 inches. Now previously, the wettest September have been 5.5 inches. The rainfall caused catastrophic damage to Boulder, as well as adjacent communities. I'm proud to say that we again demonstrated our ability to restore customers quickly and safely in a very challenging situation. And this storm caused extensive damage to critical infrastructure, including our natural gas delivery system in the Boulder area. We have identified approximately 20 miles of natural gas pipe and thousands of natural gas and electric meters that require a replacement due to water damage. We are working diligently and safely to get service restored to all of our customers in the region and have restored everyone that can be connected at this time. In some cases, we're making temporary repairs with permanent repairs scheduled for next year.","From a generation side of our business, we recently brought back 2 of our base load plants Our Monticello nuclear facility returned to service in August, following an outage where we had completed life extension and extended -- and the extended power upgrade project. This fall, Sherco 3 returned to service following the unit's catastrophic failure in late 2011.","As a result, Sherco 3 will return to used and useful status in our 2014 Minnesota rate case, which should resolve a issue from our last case. It's important to note that the majority of the restoration cost will be covered by insurance. Therefore, the cost of repairs will not impact customer bills.","Turning to our current project. We recently began a scheduled outage at Prairie Island nuclear facility, which is necessary for the 20-year life extension. During this outage, we replaced the steam generators at Unit 2. As you know, we've already successfully replaced the steam generators at Unit 1. As we mentioned last quarter, we are pursuing the addition of up to 1,900 megawatts of wind across all of our jurisdiction. Adding these resources today creates long-term value that could save our customers over $800 million in fuel costs over the next 20 years.","I'd now like to update you on where we stand with our proposals to add wind as well as thermal resources. At NSP, we are proposing to add 400 megawatts of wind through power purchase agreement and 350 megawatts of wind that we would own. The Minnesota Commission approved these wind projects last week, and the North Dakota commission is expected to rule later this year. We will also need the results from a final MISO study to determine the transmission interconnection costs for the projects, which we do expect to receive in the first quarter of 2014. The transformation study is important to ensure that the final cost remain economical for our customers.","For the natural gas, our THI in Minnesota, we recommended that the lowest cost option for our customers would be a 215-megawatt CT plant addition at our Black Dog plant and a power purchase agreement with either Calpine or Invenergy. We anticipate an ALJ recommendation by year end with the final commission decision in the first quarter of 2014.","Colorado, we filed proposal with the commission to add 170 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of wind and 317 megawatts of low-cost natural gas generation. All of these requested resources would be acquired via power purchase agreement.","In October, we received commission approval for the wind power purchase agreement. These additions will bring PSCo's total wind capacity in Colorado to more than 2,600 megawatts. The commission is expected to decide on a solar and natural gas generation proposals in early December.","So financially, operationally, we remain on track and positioned for future success.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. I'll begin by providing a brief overview of our third quarter results at each of our 4 operating companies. Third quarter ongoing earnings at PSCo decreased $0.03 per share, primarily due to higher depreciation, O&M expenses and cooler summer weather. Ongoing earnings at NSP-Minnesota increased $0.03 per share for the quarter. Quarterly results were positively impacted by electric rate increases in Minnesota and South Dakota, North Dakota interim electric rates and lower interest charges. SPS ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 per share for the quarter. A rate increase in Texas didn't fully offset higher O&M expenses, depreciation and interest charges and the impact of cooler summer weather. Finally, third quarter ongoing earnings at NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share due to higher electric and gas rates that were implemented in the first quarter of this year.","I will now review the key drivers on the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Despite $46 million in retail rate increases across several states, third quarter's gas electric margins decreased $24 million. As Paul noted in his introductory remarks, we took a net $35 million pretax charge during the quarter related to the August SPS FERC rehearing orders. Of this amount, $26 million was related to electric revenues for periods prior to 2013, $5 million was related to 2013 electric revenues and approximately $4 million was for interest charges. We are excluding the $26 million associated with years prior to 2013 from our ongoing electric margin. Adjusted for this reclassification, electric margin increased $2 million during the quarter. Going forward, we anticipate the annual revenue impact of these orders could be up to $6 million in 2014, decreasing to $4 million in June 2015.","Other factors that contributed to the decrease in third quarter electric margin were: A $20 million estimated impact from cooler summer weather versus last year; $17 million from decreased conservation and DSM incentive and $11 million from an estimated earnings test refund obligation at PSCo.","Third quarter weather normalized retail electric sales increased 0.3%. On a year-to-date normalized basis, electric sales increased 0.1% and we are remarkably close to our internal projection. Our 2013 electric sales guidance is for 0% to 0.5% growth. Natural gas margins rose $5 million, primarily due to an interim rate increase in Colorado.","Turning to expenses. O&M increased $43.8 million or 8.2% during the third quarter, and $90.9 million or 5.8% for the year-to-date period. Several factors drove the higher O&M expense during the quarter, including electric and gas distribution expenses associated with vegetation management, storms and outages. Nuclear outage amortization and other nuclear expenses and higher employee benefits related primarily to increased pension expense. We continue to project that our 2013 annual O&M expenses will increase 4% to 5%. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.6 million or 4.4%. As part of the final electric rate case order in Minnesota, NSP-Minnesota reduced depreciation expense $24 million during the third quarter. This reduction was offset by increased depreciation from normal system expansion.","I'll now provide an update on a few of our regulatory proceedings. In Minnesota, we plan to file a multiyear electric rate case in early November. The primary drivers of the request will be related to our significant capital investment program. We intend to file a 2-year rate case. The first year will be a full 2014 test year. The second year will consist of a step increase primarily for specific capital projects, but also for related property taxes and chemicals for emission controls. Consistent with the commission's multiyear claimed order, we intend to reduce our use of riders and instead recover certain investments through the multiyear plan.","Our recently approved wind investments will be included in the 2015 portion of our request. Our rate case is driven by our investments in steam generator replacement projects at Prairie Island, the Monticello upgrade and life extension, the return of Sherco 3 to service as well as increases in our nuclear O&M costs and property taxes. FOr these reasons, we expect this to be a sizable request. As a result, we intend to propose a rate plan to moderate the level of rate increases and keep it within a more predictable range for our customers over the next several years. We know that there are inherent challenges associated to filing back-to-back rate cases. And therefore, we've been meeting with stakeholders to help provide them with an understanding of the key drivers of our costs and the need to file at this time. We believe the parties are open to discussing a longer term framework, and we will continue to work with them on this approach.","Finally, we plan to file a more comprehensive set of testimony and information to provide additional support for our position and to assist the various parties with their review of our case. Also in Minnesota, we made our prudence filing related to our Monticello life extension and power upgrade project. As Ben mentioned, the project was recently completed and Monticello is back up and online. We expect that the NRC will issue licenses for the plant to operate at the higher output levels later this year or early next year.","The Monticello life extension power upgrade project was a highly complex undertaking than in many ways was more complicated than the original plant construction. The initiative, which dates back to 2003, involve the replacement of hundreds of pieces of equipment, requires thousands of workers and resulted in a largely rebuilt plant. The parts of the project evolved from the original estimate of $320 million in 2008 to $665 million due to increased federal regulatory standards and schedules, higher installation costs and a broader scope than originally anticipated. Completing the project took longer and cost more than we anticipated, but it was essential that it be done right, and we believe we made reasonable decisions along the way.","Finally, it is important to recognize that the upgrade to Monticello will benefit customer for years to come and were completed at a cost consistent with similar projects at other nuclear facilities across the country.","Turning to Colorado, on October 22, the ALJ issued a recommended decision in the Colorado natural gas case. The report is 159 pages and doesn't include a specific revenue requirements calculation. As a result, it will take us a few days to analyze and determine the recommended rate increase. However, some of the ALJ recommendation are consistent with PSCo's decision and include a prepaid pension asset remains in rate base, approval of PSCo's pension expense adjustment, approval of PSCo's annual incentive plan cost, approval of PSCo's pro forma historical tax [ph] year property tax adjustment of $7.1 million, and an equity ratio of 56% based on an actual year end capital structure. Additional recommendations include PSCo's revenue requirements will be based on a historic test year, not a forecast test year. The rate case should be based on a single year, not a multiyear rate plan and an ROE of 9.72%. It is important to recognize that these are recommended decisions. We plan to file exceptions to the report on November 1. The Colorado Commission makes the final decision, and it is expected to rule on the natural gas case before year end. Details regarding our regulatory proceedings in Wisconsin, North Dakota and New Mexico can be found in our earnings release.","Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance for 2013 and 2014. Our strong year-to-date results position us to deliver ongoing earnings in the upper half of our $1.85 to $1.95 per share guidance range. If achieved, this would represent the fourth year in a row in which our ongoing earnings have been in the upper half of our guidance range. We continue to expect GAAP EPS will be within our guidance range.","Looking ahead, we're initiating 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. This range assumes constructive outcomes in all rate case in regulatory proceedings, including the implementation of interim rate. Other key guidance assumptions are detailed in our earnings release.","We provided a $0.10 EPS guidance range ever since 2004 when our guidance range was $1.15 to $1.25 per share. As our projected earnings approach to $2 per share level, we think it is appropriate to widen the guidance range to $0.15 per share to capture the natural variability of earnings. We also think it's appropriate to have the low end of the range start at the midpoint of our 2013 guidance range or a normalized EPS of $1.90 per share, which represents the starting point for our 4% to 6% EPS growth objectives.","In closing, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter, which positions the company to meet our earnings objective for the ninth consecutive year.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Kit Konolige from BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","On the -- your sales growth outlook, I believe you said that you are expecting 0% to 0.5% in 2013. Can you discuss the breakdown by states on that and maybe any color about commercial versus industrial versus residential? And also give us a view of the longer term sales outlook that you're seeing at this point?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, sure, Kit. Let's start with the 2013 by the states. Minnesota, we're still projecting a decline of about 1.2%. In NSP-Wisconsin, just a slight decline. And then the other 2 jurisdiction, PSCo slightly up and SPS at about 1.2% range. But all of it netting to within the -- up to 0.5%. When we look to the future, we're looking at about, as we indicated in our guidance up to 0.5%, those are narrowing, not such a great degree in terms of the decline in NSP-Minnesota. In terms of the various classes of customers, it does vary by jurisdiction. I will say that C&I, we see the most growth in Texas with the oil and gas industry boom.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Kit, I would just add that our forecasting abilities for sales have really been very, very accurate this year, and we believe heading into next year too. I think we really got our arms around what's happening with the economy and how that relates to our sales growth.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So you're expecting -- is it fair to summarize that you're saying you're expecting, netted around the various states roughly flattish to slightly up sales growth over kind of the middle to longer term?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, that's correct.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And what -- I mean that's lower obviously than historically. What trends are you attributing that to, just economics, energy efficiency?","Teresa S. Madden","All of those, yes.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right, Okay. It sounds like I have that part of the note written already then.","Teresa S. Madden","Good.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Thanks, Kit.","Operator","And the next question comes from -- let me quickly gather details, Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First on O&M, the O&M growth embedded here in 2014 guidance is 2% to 3% versus the 4% to 5% from this year. What's driving the lower sequential rate? Is that pension or is also process improvement? And should we take that 2% to 3% and extrapolate that as the long-term growth rate that you're targeting?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, in terms of the 2% to 3%, yes, pension is contributing to that. We did say that 2013 was going to be our high mark. also, we are assuming that likely, we'll have some uptick in the discount rate. But we are also seeing some -- we are working towards improvement, process improvements on the operational side of our business. And in terms of our overall growth rate, if we look to the future, we do intend to keep them lower than our historical 4% where we've been at.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And on the wind project, if that's approved, when will the CapEx impact? Is that 2015, or is there any CapEx bet in 2014? And then can you provide some more clarity on this MISO study? What specifically is the scope of what they're looking at?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, let's start in terms of the wind projects. There's a very small amount in 2014. The lion's share of the estimated spend will be in, actually it's in the latter part of 2015 around the third quarter. Because they are anticipated to go in service by the end of that year. The MISO study is really related to some interconnections and some paths primarily what will be required. So we need to have the completion of that study to ultimately determine what the cost will be for those transmission paths what we are required.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And the last question is the major objectives for the Analyst Day on December 4 with -- is that when we can expect the CapEx refresh for Xcel?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, that's right, Neil, you can expect that, as Teresa mentioned, these wind projects will drive some CapEx needs, will refresh everything. I said in my remarks, I think we continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest in our utilities, and we'll update you on that. We'll update you on where we see the value proposition and give you a general operational and financial update.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Fremont from Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess my first question is you talk about a potentially substantial filing in Minnesota. The last filing I think was close to $300 million. Should we be looking at something in that range? And can you remind us what percent was the $285 million that you were requesting in terms of percentage increase?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think the -- correct me if I'm wrong, Scott or Teresa, I think the $285 million was like 11%.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes. I was in the 10s.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, okay. And at this point, we don't want to get any more specific other than to tell you we know it'll be a significant case. And we know putting rate moderation programs in place are going to be very beneficial to making the -- hope we make in the outcome of the case constructive and successful. It obviously reflects a lot of capital costs and mutually related as well as just general infrastructure. So I think we're in pretty good shape. It's going to be significant. We've talked about that before. It's the reason why we also we're sharing with our stakeholders what it looks like over a 5-year horizon. And we think the pace of rate increases will moderate significantly in the next few years.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Ben, I know a year ago the commission have talked about sort of changing the rules for the -- or the requirements for the interim increase? Were any changes made? Or is it essentially the same as it would have been when the $251 million went into effect in January?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think there -- I mean there's a couple of things that have changed. I mean one, as you know, they changed how the methodology of calculation -- calculating the refund obligation works. And we did have a court order that essentially gives the commission a little more flexibility in how they grant interim rates. And frankly, we're aware of that. And we've incorporate that into our moderate -- rate moderation plans.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the wind projects that have already been approved in Colorado and in Minnesota, can you give us sort of a dollar amount of construction associated with the approved projects?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, I mean, well of course, the ones that are on the power purchase agreements, they're in the -- a better way to describe that to you is with their levelized prices are, and that's in the $25 to $35 range. In terms of the ones that we have the opportunity to own, I think we're looking at just rough figures in what is it, 1,700 to 2,100 of KWs, something around that?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, around there.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, 1750 per KW installed would be an average cost that you see in the industry. You can take that times the 350 and come up with an estimate of the capital.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","It works out to the a very good levelized cost for our customers. And again, these prices are so compelling that it's -- I mean, the energy associated with it is less than what you can do locked in a 20-year gas strip for. Hence, the 800 million plus of fuel savings. We're getting the environmental, we're getting the capacity savings that these projects bring. So we're really excited about it.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And the last thing, the 2014 guidance, I assume, carries forward the ongoing impact of the FERC order. And is there a possibility of getting that overturned?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, it does include the ongoing impact or potential impact from that. We have filed for re-hearing. We think our positions are strong. So we feel good about that. But we do have that incorporated into our projections for 2014.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Listen. First question, the 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth rate, what time period roughly should we be thinking about? Is that a 5-year growth rate? 3 years? And what associated rate base growth should we assume is embedded in that growth rate target?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I mean, Ali, it's long term, so we could say 3 -- 3 to 5 years. In terms of the rate base growth, really no different than we've been talking to you on the front end, over the 5 years, potentially after like 5%. But there is still the front-end load. This year, we have high capital to spend. We'll start to taper down, we'll have some moderation, assuming we would move forward with the 15 wind projects. I mean, we are, assuming we will move forward, pending the final approvals. But that's really what the landscape looks like.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also, are you assuming pretty much flattish trends in terms of earned ROEs over that period or any improvement? Or how should we think about that?","Teresa S. Madden","And generally, pretty flat over that period.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Ali, as you know, over the last several years, we've been around that consolidated ROE of 10%. And given the macroeconomic environment we're in, I think that's a pretty good assumption going forward.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the dividend policy, I wanted to get a little more insight. I know you guys have been saying in the past that as the earnings growth starts to taper down, you start to get more aggressive on the dividend. So we see that the dividend growth is now in line with EPS. Previously, it was slightly below. The fact of the matter is, Ben or Teresa, that your payout ratio is still probably lower than your peer group. And so if you keep dividend in line with earnings, you keep it at that payout ratio. So any sort of thoughts on that? I would have thought you may have wanted to grow dividend at a faster pace than earnings? So any insights in your thinking there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, I think we started with giving you the clarity that the dividend growth rate objective is now 4 to 6. We know that our dividend payout ratio is modest compared to our peers, and that's a good thing. So we've got lots of options going forward in what we do and how we do it and the various options you can reward shareholders. Obviously, that's a very important topic that we'll discuss with our board. And we'll look at a number of factors, CapEx, macroeconomic conditions, credit rating objectives, you name it. It's -- we look at it. And I mean, I'm excited that we can continue to offer such a compelling value proposition. And I think it's the hallmark of what we've been able to accomplish. And one thing, as I pointed out on my notes is, we actually do hit our objectives. We've got a history of that. So I hope everybody takes comfort in that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And last question, Ben, when you had laid out the last 5-year CapEx program, in there you had embedded, I think it was about 800 million of equity or it's about 400 million with this after-market program that you have put out there. As you think about these new wind projects, assuming they do come in. And I think you've said that you assume that they do come in. And doing the math, another $650 million, $700 million of CapEx, what does that do to your thinking about equity in the mix, as you look forward now?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Do you want to take that one or you want me to...","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I mean -- maybe the short answer, Ali, is we really do plan to discuss the whole, complete plan at our Analyst Day. So we'll be revising and refreshing all of that when we meet with you at that time. So...","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to say, we should assume more equity just given the additional in CapEx and the balance between equity and that? Is that fair to think about?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Let's -- first of all, let's make sure that projects are finally approved, and we'll share that capital forecast. As you know, timing of the capital forecast is pretty important when it comes to any equity needs. I think the bottom line is our equity needs are very modest going forward, I mean. So I don't think that will be a big issue but we certainly can give you more clarity at the Analyst Day.","Teresa S. Madden","I agree with that.","Operator","And the next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Quick follow-up on the dividend. Have you given out a payout ratio guidance or just the growth rate?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","At this point, just the growth rate.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is it fair to assume that implied 60%, if we go out to guidance 2014 and apply the growth rate, is that about where you're comfortable?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think we're just comfortable right now on the 4 to 6. And we're going to -- obviously, as I said just previously, we'll discuss various ways we can reward shareholders within that target with our board. And again, we know we have a modest payout ratio. We also have outstanding credit ratings and excellent opportunities to continue to invest in our utility operations.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then quick on the gas usage growth. I mean, you guys posted really good gas usage growth for the last several quarters. I was wondering if you could characterize the continuing trend, whether you see that continuing, if there's fundamental developments there? Just kind of what's going on over the last few quarters to drive that 4% to 5%?","Teresa S. Madden","I mean, I think, I would characterize it as maybe an aberration. We are watching it. I would say that our weather normalization, is very cold. It's primarily in PSCo in the early part of the year. We may have some aberrations with that. As you can see, when we look to '14, we're actually projecting some decreases. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily, we'll continue to watch ongoing long-term trend to see that uptick at that level.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Do you think there's been a material response given the decline in gas prices? Do you think that's a driver and that if you gas prices going to 6, 7, that you'd see a significant pullback? Or is that not necessarily relevant?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I think in general, with anything when gas prices go up, people potentially monitor their use. So it's depending how much and when.","Operator","And the next question comes from Neil Kalton from Wells Fargo.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just as a quick question on EPS guidance for '14 and specifically the low end, which is flat with 2013, really. So what kind of has to happen to see flat year-over-year? What should we specifically be sort of looking out for, I guess?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I think there are several things that could affect next year, but we talked about the Minnesota case and all our rate cases that we have out there. We are assuming, as we always do in terms of when we initiate guidance and constructive outcomes in terms of those rate cases. Now if there was some deviation from that, that could be a factor. But there's other things, too, O&M variation, sales, the whole list of things that could occur.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think -- I mean, Teresa said it. But I also just think -- I mean, we didn't achieve what we started out to achieve this year with the Minnesota rate case. I mean, I think everybody knows that. And as both myself and Teresa talked about, we have the fortunate uptick for weather. That mitigated a lot of it. We had some management initiatives that mitigated the rest of it, positioning us very well for this year. But of course, you can't count on weather next year. And while I think we are as best positioned as we possibly can be for these '14 phase. I mean, it's certainly going to be a big driver of our success next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Unknown Analyst","This is Paul Zimbata [ph] from Julien's team. Just a quick question on the Minnesota multiyear rate case. If you could just talk about decision to file in November with running at the suboptimal level and without the NRC license, if you think that, that will have any kind of implication?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","At suboptimal level, I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about. What's that?","Unknown Analyst","Same that you were [indiscernible]","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I'm sorry, I misheard you. I'm sorry, Paul.","Teresa S. Madden","Me too!","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, first of all, the Monticello we expect, even as the shutdown delayed it a bit. But we expect the Monticello license, the first piece of it, to come through in late November, possibly early December, and with the approval for the final piece, maybe as early as March 2014. So I don't think that the NRC license will be a significant factor in the rate case. Does that answer your question? Because I apologize for not understanding it.","Unknown Analyst","That's okay. Yes, that was it.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Turnure from JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a question kind of in that vein, but more specifically on the Monticello up-rate prudence case. Is the NRC license going to impact the timing of how that progresses? And then kind of second there, is there a precedence that we can kind of look to to understand how they are going to treat and look at that overrun versus the original estimate?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, let me kick it off and we've got the experts sitting by my side here. I don't -- first of all, I don't think the NRC timing of that won't impact the prudence proceeding. I also think if you -- there's a number of different ways that historically, commissions look at prudence review. And the traditional way, we've make decisions at various points in the project life, I think we feel pretty comfortable about. We did have overruns. But if you look around the industry, so did everybody else. These up-rates have turned out to be much more expensive. And then finally, despite the increased costs, we certainly would have gone forward with the project at $11 gas when this project started. And frankly, it still makes sense for our consumers today. So I think we're in pretty good shape there.","Teresa S. Madden","The key component in our portfolio mix, as we look forward, and we think nuclear has a good position versus what...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Electricity [ph] carbon free. I mean, Dave or Scott, I don't know if you want to add anything?","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is around the mitigation efforts going into the general rate case in November. You gave a little bit of color in the press release today, but I was just wondering if you could talk more about that, flesh it out a little bit and give more color around how the discussions with the intervenors are progressing so far?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I'll start. And then you guys can -- in terms of we did, as you know, in the 2013 case, the commission made an adjustment relative to theoretical reserve and an 8-year amortization. So we're looking at some alternatives around that. That would be a primary one. And then potentially, we have some daily refunds. That would be the second. But more to come on that as we go forward. If you 2 want to talk about the stakeholders?","Scott M. Wilensky","Hi, this is Scott. I would just say we've been trying to work with folks to get them to understand why we're coming back here in November, to make sure they understand the drivers of our costs and which plants are affecting that, which plant additions. And I think that overall, people are working with us, receptive to the fact that we are looking at a moderation plan and understanding that our costs are increasing in a period that's sort of peakish. And that we'll try to smooth that out.","Operator","And the next question comes from Angie Storozynski from company Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","First of all, I wanted to actually thank you for finally giving us a sense of what is the new long-term growth rate for earnings because with your comment in the past that it would be a deceleration in earnings growth past '14. We were kind of scrambling, is it 2%? Is it 3%? So I think that that's -- provides a lot clarity, the 4% to 6%. Now on the -- again, the Minnesota rate case, the multiyear aspect of it, how should we think about it? I mean, did you hear from intervenors that they will be receptive to a multiyear rate case? And also, given the less-than-satisfying outcome of the last rate case, I mean, should we expect that if this rate case doesn't go well, there's going to be another one filed just after the current one? So are we basically -- is the strategy to basically file rate cases until you get what is required to have a profitable business in Minnesota?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, let me take a stab at this. I mean we're working with stakeholders now because we don't want to be in that continual rate case loop, and neither does the commission, the staff or our customers. That said, I don't think anybody thinks that the capital we're spending and the expenses we're incurring aren't for good use. It's pretty much evidenced in what we were able to accomplish here over the summer. We had half of our customers out. So we're making the right investment decisions. I think a multiyear plan, and Scott alluded to it, helps moderate rates today, recognizing that the pace of rate increases modulates significantly the further out in time you go. So our plan is to be successful in this case. And to replicate what I think has been a pretty good model and I think has been pretty successful in Colorado for all stakeholders, shareholders alike, customers alike. So it's not our plan to file rate cases continuously.","Teresa S. Madden","Maybe, Ben, I would just add to that in terms of the stakeholder input that we see. They were actually suggesting the 2-year case. And so I mean, clearly, we're having I would say a positive dialogue and we have taken some of their input. And that's part why we're filing the 2-year case instead of potentially what was allowed, the 3-year case.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, I mean, essentially, to Teresa's point, it's a 5-year look and see. And so I think everybody is open to what we're trying to accomplish. I also think, too, we're -- we got some I think very good programs to continue to be more efficient. And we recognized that's what we need to do. Teresa mentioned we'll see our pace of O&M and certainly out by pension. It's going to be also helped by a lot of productivity improvements, with process improvements, et cetera which -- I'm not talking about deferred maintenance, I'm talking about improved processes. So I think -- I mean, obviously, it's a big case. But I think based on what we heard today, we are cautiously optimistic. It will go well.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I know that you're not providing any details about the filing ahead of it. But I mean, how big an impact roughly speaking would it have on electric bills? Would the increase be significantly above the inflation level?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","What is inflation?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Well, optimistically, let's assume 2% to 3%.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think you're going to find our rate moderation plans are going to be in that zone of reasonableness that stakeholders would be open to.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A quick one on Teresa, I appreciate your comments on the gas sales forecast for 2014. And you'd said maybe some of the growth have been a bit of an aberration in the weather numbers perhaps. Is negative 2 just giving back some of that noise? Or is that a better handle on what you see as underlying growth?","Teresa S. Madden","I would probably go with the former, potentially. A little bit hard to say, but...","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is it -- once you've kind of adjust for maybe what was surprising this year, is your underlying outlook is more flattish like for electric?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then if I may, just on the sales topic, is there -- you're obviously talking 0% to 0.5%. Let's just -- and Ben, I heard your comments about feeling you've got your arms around the drivers. Let's just say it was 0% to negative 0.5%. Is that a very -- is that -- would that be enough to put you outside of your trajectory on 4% to 6%? Or do you think you have enough other things you can do to sort of maintain it, in the event that you did see kind of sustained modest shrinkage?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, I mean, that's -- I don't think so. It would be my initial reaction.","Teresa S. Madden","I would agree. Put us outside of the range, we could look at that [indiscernible]","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It would lead you to the bottom of it, but not outside? Is that...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I don't -- I mean, it will be really difficult to give you an answer to that because there are so many other factors, where it would occur, what our regulatory mechanisms were. I think we've got far more flexibility than just the 50 basis points movement in sales, significantly altering our long-term growth expectations.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","We were also happy to see you get the growth rate out there as well because there was definitely a lot of concern, I guess. So 5% is pretty good. Just a couple of questions. On the 4% to 6%, what gets you to the high end? What gets you to the low end? Can you kind of go into that? And obviously, you talked a little bit about flexibility you have as far as sales volumes? And that has to do with customer class, too. But just any color you can give us on high end versus low end of the growth rate?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I would, me and Teresa, I would do the easy part and Teresa can do the other part. I think that clearly on the top end, what we would want to do is see improvement in our earned ROEs. And of course, in this interest rate environment, authorized ROEs, I would say that will be a stretch. But you've heard us talk before, if we could close the gap between actual earned and authorized, that would be one piece of it. Continuing to have a capture rate base growth opportunities, investment opportunities would be another. We talked just in the last call with Jonathan about sales growth. Of course, positive sales growth certainly would be supportive. and all those factors go the other way to get you on the low end.","Teresa S. Madden","Great. I think you've covered the key items, but ROE [indiscernible]","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","O&M?","Teresa S. Madden","Oh, sure.","Andrew Levi","Okay. Just 2 more questions. I don't know if I'm just reading into this or is it just -- is it really just 4% to 6%. But on the dividend, you mentioned that there are a lot of options that you'd like to discuss with the board relative to where the payout ratio is. Can you discuss what those options are?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, I think you heard a lot of the callers trying to understand what the pace of that is going to be. I mean, if there's going to -- I mean, we're going to have a dividend payout ratio target, et cetera. So I -- again, I don't know if we can provide any more clarity. I mean we have discussions, as you would guess, with our board routinely around the dividend because we -- as we do with other value part of -- the value components of our value proposition, and it's an important topic. We'll continue to have these discussions. The good news is that we can have these discussions about how we're going to reward shareholders, because we do have a modest payout ratio and we are now aligning our dividend growth with EPS growth. So I know everybody wants more clarity. But let's just start with that objective, and we'll give you more clarity on that as time goes on.","Andrew Levi","What is the timing on getting that clarity? What is typically is the board meeting that you generally have this discussion?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, we have an Analyst Day in December. We typically have made dividend announcements for the last 5 years now at our shareholders' meeting. You're not bound by that. But I mean, I guess that would be kind of the guidance I would give you.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And your payout ratio right now based on your 2014 guidance is around 55%, 56%. Why not take the payout ratio up to 60% to 65% based on your profile?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I guess I'm just going to repeat what we said. I mean, we know we have a payout ratio that is modest. Of course, we've had that for a number of years now. And I think it's extremely important, and I'm not going to speak for my board, but it's extremely important that you have a sustainable, predictable dividend. And we've provided that for many, many years now. We'll continue to provide that for many years to come.","Paul A. Johnson","I think the other thing I would point, Andy, if you look at the midpoint of 2013 guidance range, payout ratio is probably more like 58%.","Andrew Levi","Yes, I'm just talking more on '14 and what type of increase we can see in '14...","Paul A. Johnson","If the earnings and the dividends are growing at a similar rate, the payout ratio is not going to change.","Andrew Levi","And then the last question has to do with the stock and kind of again looking at the midpoint of guidance. And so if you kind of took that 4% to 6% and you took it out to '15, the stock itself, on a valuation base is relative to the regulator group. So pulling out some of the gas you named have traded much higher multiples. Is trading at about 6% discount despite the 5% earnings growth rate and this dividend growth rate as well. How as a management do you think you've closed that gap and get back to where you used to actually trade at a premium to the group now trading at a substantial discount?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I hope, one, continue to remind people that we've had a successful track record of delivering shareholder value and then two, on a prospective basis, making sure we continue to deliver shareholder value. And clearly, I think, we've had some overhang on with the pace and frequency of our regulatory filings. Going to multiyears, I think we'll provide more clarity on that so I think that will be helpful. Continuing to work on closing the gap between earned and authorized, ROE would be another process and continuing to make progress. But the reality is we've delivered a pretty good track record here. And I think we're positioned to continue to do that. And so I think it's a matter of time before people recognize that.","Operator","The last question comes from Ashar Khan from the company Visium.","Ashar Khan","Can I just ask you, Ben, I guess, we go through this in different states going through that in New York, over here. I was just looking, Minnesota has a gubernatorial election next year. Can this rate case become part of any issue or no? Arguably, the elections have been immune to what's happening on...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean, that's a great question and I just will tell you that everybody here is shaking their heads no. I mean, we do not anticipate that the rate case will be a political issue in this election.","Teresa S. Madden","All right. Well, thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Financial Conference in a few weeks. In addition, we hope many of you will attend our analyst meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 4. We plan to update you on our efforts to spend the O&M cost per pound, our Minnesota electric rate case, our nuclear construction projects and rate base opportunities. And until then, Paul Johnson and the IR team are available to take your call. Thanks a lot.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","See you later, everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 second quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions.","This morning, we will update you on recent legislative, regulatory, and business developments, review our 2015 second quarter results, and reaffirm our 2015 earnings guidance range.","Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webpage. Please note we have updated our slides to provide more information. In addition, we will post a video on our website of Teresa summarizing our financial results.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul and good morning. Today I'm going to provide a business update and discuss our recent legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas. Later, Teresa will provide more detail on some of our recent regulatory decisions and financial drivers.","We reported $0.39 for the quarter, flat with last year. Overall, we've had a solid first half of 2015, with results generally in line with our expectations. While we've had some challenges from lower than expected sales, unfavorable weather and additional adjustments from the Monticello proceeding, we fully expect to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share.","I want to start by saying how pleased I am with the company's response to recent storms across our Minnesota and Wisconsin service territories. Two weekends ago, intense winds with speeds between 70 to 80 miles per hour knocked out service for 250,000 customers.","Our employees in the field responded quickly and effectively, restoring 75% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% within 45 hours. All of our customers were restored to power within three days. This event is yet another reminder of the company's top-tier storm restoration efforts and illustrates the value of building a resilient system.","We also hit several additional operational milestones during the quarter that I wanted to share with you. Beginning with our Monticello nuclear facility, we are very happy to report that this month we received NRC concurrence and reached 671 megawatts of generation. The facility is now fully in service, operating at designed capacity and meets all the requirements of the Minnesota commission to be considered used and useful.","Finally, our Cherokee combined-cycle natural gas plant in Colorado successfully completed its first fire on gas and is on time and on budget. Last year we spoke to you about our refocused strategic plan with a key tenet being improving the performance of our utilities and reducing the ROE gap. Our approach was to target the jurisdiction where the gap was the greatest and seek legislation in those states to improve the timeliness and method of cost recovery.","Beginning with Minnesota, last month the Governor signed into law a bill that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multi-year plans to up to five years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for the recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index, and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid monetization. We're now considering how to include these improved mechanisms in our Minnesota rate case filing scheduled for later this year.","In Texas, we, along with several other non-ERCOT utilities sponsored legislation that will reduce regulatory lag and provides for improved inclusion of post test year capital additions, more timely implementation of new rates, and greater flexibility and more timely recovery of new natural gas plant investments.","The Governor signed the bill last month and while this does not eliminate all regulatory lag in Texas, it does represent an important incremental step towards improvement. We feel the legislation in both Minnesota and Texas strengthens the regulatory compact, helps to close the ROE gap and enhances our ability to meet our long-term earning growth objectives.","Moving to Colorado, we anticipate that the Colorado Commission will be scheduling informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. We continue to see the value of these types of investments for our customers, particularly when considering the current low-price commodity environment.","After the information meetings are held, we plan to make a regulatory filing before year end that will establish a formal framework that incorporates feedback from the meetings. Following the commission's decision on a preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016.","In Minnesota, we were pleased to see, the Minnesota Commission supported our settlement with smaller solar developers, which limits the size of proposed solar gardens to no more than 5 Megawatts. This important policy settlement ensures that Minnesota has one of the largest community solar gardens in the country rather, but also minimizes the impact of the program on our customers' bills.","Xcel Energy continues to be a major advocate of solar and we view it as an important and growing component of our resource mix. However, we want to ensure that it's done at the most attractive price point for our customers. A couple of recent studies confirm that utility scale solar is far more cost-effective for consumers than smaller applications and we think it's important that policy be based on these sound economics. So while solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy subsidization from non-participants, you will continue to see us advocate that the primary focus be on utility scale solar so that we can keep energy cost affordable for consumers as we move to cleaner energy sources.","So I think we've made significant progress during the first half of the year. We look forward to implementing some of these new mechanisms and policies in the coming months.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ben and good morning. Today we reported ongoing earnings for the second quarter of $0.39 per share, flat with last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to new rates and higher rider revenue driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. These incremental revenues were partially offset by unfavorable weather and lower sales.","Additionally, offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, higher property taxes, and lower AFUDC. Each of these items separately had a negative $0.02 per share impact on earnings.","Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down four-tenths of a percent, driven primarily by declines in the residential class, partially offset by modest growth in the C&I class. Regardless, we continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 4% compared to a national rate of 5.5%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%.","The decline in residential sales is driven by lower customer usage. We believe this trend is due to a combination of factors including appliance efficiency, conservation efforts, and an increase in multi-unit dwellings. We have adjusted our annual electric sales guidance to reflect year-to-date results, which lowers our expected growth rate for 2015 to about 0.5%.","We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a long-term trend. It is important to note that we will be implementing de-coupling for the residential and small C&I class in Minnesota in 2016, which will offset any decline in customer usage trend.","Next I will provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Earlier this month, we received decisions on several outstanding items under reconsideration in our Minnesota electric rate case and our Monticello prudence proceeding. The Commission allowed NSP Minnesota to recover its 2015 rate increase beginning in early March and determined that the Monticello extended power upgrade investment was not used and useful until certain NRC conditions were met. These conditions were met in early July.","While we believe that the Commission should have concluded differently related to the in-service date of the Monticello project, we will review the written order to determine our next steps.","In Colorado, last month we received intervenor testimony in our PSCo multi-year natural gas rate case. The staff recommended a rate decrease, while the Office of Consumer Council recommended a modest rate increase. Primary differences between the Company and other parties were driven by ROE, capital structure, and whether to use a historical test year in the establishment of base rates. The positions recommended by the staff in the OTC were consistent with past positions and we remain confident we will reach a constructive outcome in the case.","Finally, I wanted to address our rate case in New Mexico. After another utility in the state had its case dismissed, the New Mexico Commission determined our filing also did not comply with their new interpretation of the statute regarding forward test years and the timing of rate case submissions. As a result, the Commission dismissed our case as well.","We believe our filing was consistent with the requirements of the New Mexico legislation that allows for a forward test year and have appealed to the State Supreme Court. While the timing of resolution is uncertain, we plan to re-file the case later this year.","This morning we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range due to the timing of O&M expenses and revenue recognition from the Minnesota rate case, both of which will provide for a more favorable comparison in the second half of the year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed.","With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are very pleased with the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas during the quarter. The new legislation provides a framework that will allow us to reduce regulatory lag and streamline the regulatory process. As a result, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of reducing the ROE gap by 50 basis points by 2018. Growth projects like the Courtenay Wind Farm are on schedule. We remain on track to limit increases in O&M to 0% to 2% for 2015.","The company is well positioned to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually and our dividend at 5% to 7%. And finally, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per share.","So operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Considering the legislation in Texas and the legislation in Minnesota and you are now very confident of increasing or reducing the regulatory lag by 50 bps by 2018, just wondering if, at what point would you consider increasing your long-term growth rate commensurate with the improvement in ROEs?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's what we're focused on is closing that gap. And if we close that gap by 50 basis points that will get us on the upper end of those growth objectives. So you'd have to start to exceed that and see some other things before we would be comfortable doing that Michael.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Would you say that it would require a, I guess, wait and see after the results of a rate filing in Texas? Is that...?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We need to implement it. We are working the plan. This is the legislation. While it wasn't essential to close that gap, it's certainly helpful. And now we need to execute on that and let things play out.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You are welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Good morning.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Hi, thanks. On the Minnesota legislation, just wonder if you could lay out maybe a more detailed timeline in terms of \u2013 I know it's obviously one of your lower spreads on \u2013 a wider spread between allowed and earned right now. How do you go about closing that, sort of taking advantage of the legislative items?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you are absolutely right. We have been under-earning in Minnesota. If you are looking at the charts by the way that were attached, keep in mind that that's a little bit distorted due to some revenue recognition. But you are right; it's been in the mid-8s and we need to improve that.","Take a look at what we did in Colorado. When you get into a multi-year plan, I think you've got a much better shot at closing that ROE gap. You are getting all of your capital recovery; you are getting your O&M potentially recovered and I think Travis, the other thing that I think is so important about entering into these multi-year plans is it gives you an opportunity to communicate more frequently with your commissions around important policy decisions, resource plans decisions, where we want to go with our portfolio generation et cetera.","So you don't get disconnects. And I think if you look at why we've under-earned, we've had a lot of CapEx going through a funnel. We had to relicense our nuclear plants. We had some challenges there as everyone in the industry did. And we didn't have a lot of forums to communicate some of those challenges. So it's not only the mechanisms associated with the legislation in the multi-year plan; it's kind of what that frees you up to do. And I am optimistic that we will make good progress next year and in the years to come.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay, great. Do you think this is something you could do in one cycle for your multi-year plan or is this closing up the gap, would that take two rate cases or two cycles? Is this something that you can close quickly?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the multi-year plan, as you know the legislation allows for up to five years and allows a number of other things. The regulatory team is busy right now assessing how we put those tools to work, what alternatives we want to present to the department and ultimately the commission and we'll figure out \u2013 we'll use the tools that we can and do it in a pragmatic approach. Now, depending on how you structure that, do you get it all in one year? \u2013 Not necessarily. But do you get it over the timeframe of the filing? \u2013 Yes. That would be the plan.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Great, thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Ben. Good morning, Teresa. Have you indicated when you are going to re-file in New Mexico?","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have just indicated that we will re-file before the end of the year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","It seems as though the commission has kind of said we want a do-over with PNM. How does that play into the timing?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean \u2013 are you talking about the appeal or \u2013 I mean right now the commission has taken the rule back and is trying to I guess maybe understand their own interpretation of the rules. So we recognize that there might be some time lag with that, Paul. So we will re-file a case that we think will meet their current interpretation of the rules by year end, so we can get to start it while we are trying to sort through what the future test year rule and legislation really means from a administrative standpoint.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. I mean, we obviously think that the legislation allows for the forward tester as we had previously interpreted and that's why we are filed with the Supreme Court in terms of an appeal.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Did I answer your question Paul?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes, you did. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And where \u2013 you kind of walked down the growth numbers. Where are you seeing the most weakness?","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Seeing the most what?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Weakness.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean \u2013 and Teresa, jump in here, but it's really been on the residential side. And we are seeing good growth, Paul; we are seeing about 1% customer growth but what's happening we believe is you've got energy efficiency \u2013 some of that we are driving of course. And you have \u2013 where we are thinking some of the growth is, is in more multi-unit dwellings which inherently use less electricity. So those two factors combined are putting \u2013 or offsetting growth with lower usage per household.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. I mean, just to supplement that in the multi-units, we think they use about 50% what a standard, stand-alone dwelling or home would use. So you get the customer growth, but just not at the same pace in terms of adding to our growth.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Have you seen efficiency start to plateau with I guess a lot of the light bulbs already been switched out and a lot of the appliances have been switched out? Where are we in that cycle?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know that's a really good question, Paul. I mean I think if you look at technology, it's going to continue to get more efficient. Will the pace of that efficiency slow down? \u2013 I don't know if I have a crisp answer for you at this point. But I wouldn't think that it's going to plateau and just level off. I think you're going to continue to see more efficiencies; you're going to continue to start to see \u2013 as we get to the, ultimately the Internet of Things, even more efficiency. I think we are a few years away from that.","But the gas business has been a long-term efficiency cycle and I think we will see that on the electric side. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. It does mean though, back to the earlier comment that we have to start rethinking rate design and what the 21st century regulatory compact and offerings to our consumers look like. That's one of the reasons again, why we think it's so important to have longer-term regulatory compact, so you can have these dialogues with your policymakers.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much for your time.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to focus on Minnesota. You're successful at getting a legislation for potentially a five-year deal, but I think previously I think you had the ability to file for three-year deals but I think maybe you filed for two. Is there reluctance on the regulator for granting a longer-term deal? Some states, you see regulators push back on longer-term deals. I wonder what's your feeling or view of that in Minnesota.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, keep in mind that prior to this legislation, the multi-year compact was not really comprehensive. So when we filed, we were able to file for larger step-in type capital programs. This legislation was passed with input from a lot of important parties, including the Department and certainly the Governor's office and it was passed and it was supported. That said, I think to your point, this could be transformative, it's change, and I think our team has to work with the department and make sure that they're comfortable with the pace of what we are doing. So that's what we are trying to assess right now. So your question is a good one. I think the policymakers support it. I think there is a number of reasons why the business community would want this and it's good for our customers and this could be tremendously more efficient than how we process rate cases today. So I am optimistic we are going to use the majority of those tools and come out with something far more comprehensive than we had prior to this legislation.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","And I guess on your next filing you would file, you would attempt to get the full five years?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're going to incorporate a number of the tools. We'll figure out \u2013 I mean, I would anticipate that we will look at the five years, figure out how that could be done, but I also anticipate that we'll present the Commission with different alternatives. The key is, get something comprehensive, make use of the tools, and close that regulatory gap. So that is always the first and foremost in mind. And again, we want something that frees up space to have a timeframe that we can work with the Commission on other important policy decisions.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Paz with Wolfe Research.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, David.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, David.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Just on Minnesota filing, when would you expect a final decision? On the November filing.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The pending case that we haven't filed yet?","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry, yes. On the November filing.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It could take either late in 2016, it could \u2013 depending on the schedule, other cases that we know are going to be filed, we could go into 2017. But I think the key thing that's important is we have interim rates and we are anticipating that those will start just as they always have. I mean, that's still part of the new compact that we have starting in January 1, 2016. So I think that's really the key thing to be focused on.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Okay. And separately, did you update your capital plan for the Courtenay Wind Farm?","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We haven't updated it yet; we plan later this year. I mean, we'll do a more comprehensive update. I mean, we have disclosed the cost is about $300 million and so \u2013 again, we'll do a more comprehensive look later this year.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that project's moving along very well, so...","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, we expect that the Commission is going to probably rule on \u2013 the Commission in North Dakota and in Minnesota will rule on that in August.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just last, I think your projected rate base growth over the period you've outlined is just shy of 5%.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC","And so it looks like Courtenay will be added. Any other potential upside to that growth? I know previously you just said that you guys will do a new look soon. But anything we should think about? I mean you mentioned gas rate base, other type of renewable. Just anything else that we might be missing, particularly as carbon rules get at some point finalized?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I mean, we're going to look at all of those opportunities you mentioned. They are not included in the CapEx forecast right now. Maybe there's more opportunities for Courtney Wind type projects, the Calpine projects that we have done in the past. We've got a great backyard and I think there is a number of opportunities that we think makes sense and are keeping with our low-risk profile that we're going to pursue. We're conservative; we're not going to increase our forecast for things that aren't \u2013 that you can't touch. But we're certainly going to go after all the opportunities that makes sense for us.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paul Johnson","Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions.","This morning, we will review our 2019 third quarter results, discuss earnings guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and also update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.","With that, I will turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Fowke","Well, thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. Three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7%, off of 2019 base year.","Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiatives, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. This represents a base capital forecast and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan.","We are also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long term EPS growth objective. We are very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low.","Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a non-regulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota, which runs through 2026 and 2039.","We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect that non-regulated returns will be lower in the near term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission and we expect approval in December or January.","We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we will continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities and will proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the cost and benefits of the transaction. Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisition.","Our two proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower, produce significant savings for our customers and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020.","We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522 megawatts Sagamore wind project in New Mexico with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operation expected by the end of 2020.","In the upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection cost. We had planned on 100 megawatts at Crowned Ridge as a build-own-transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. So as a result, we, like The Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again and we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. We expect similar constraints in investment opportunities in SPP in Colorado as well. While not in our five-year forecast and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob. He will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?","Bob Frenzel","Thanks Ben and good morning everyone. We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investment.","Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. And lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share.","Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. Year-to-date weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance.","Turning to O&M. And consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower cost in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. For year-to-date, O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. We expect lower cost for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 15 to 2% from 2018 levels.","Now let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on the current test year with a capital reach forward through June 19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. Interveners filed testimony and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6% in a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearings start November and we expect a Commission decision in December with new rates effective January 2020.","We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico, based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The requests largely reflect investments for the Hale Wind Project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020.","Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.","Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, largely driven by wind production tax credits which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note, wind O&M is recovered and riders in most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings.","In our earnings release, you will find more details about our updated $22 billion, five-year capital forecast which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. The capital plan results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3%, if we would maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range.","We have also updated our financing plan which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next three years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. The financial plan reflects incremental capital investments of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2022 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets.","With that, I will wrap up. We are continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We are going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well-positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. We have announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong transparent rate base growth and customer value. We have initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long term objective. Finally, we are very confident that we can deliver long term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will take a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Great outlook guys. Just a couple questions. You have got a lot of rate cases pending. And when you think about the range of potential outcomes in terms of things that might influence financial results like return on equity, how do you sort of flex for that when you think about the guidance range? And do you contemplate with interest rates this low that the direction of travel on ROEs might still be modestly lower than where we are today?","Ben Fowke","I think, Greg, that's a great question. I mean we do recognize that we have some modest risk for which we have incorporated into our range. I think we got a lot of things going for us. First of all, we are very much aligned with our commissions on what we are doing with the clean energy transition. It's good to have their support with that. I think second of all, if you think about it, we certainly don't have above market ROEs today. And then finally, if you look at some data points on some of the cases that we have decided recently, they kind of point to a reasonable ROE. So we always know we don't everything we ask for, of course. And I think we are very comfortable with the guidance we have set for us.","Greg Gordon","Okay. That was my only question. Thank you. Have a great day.","Ben Fowke","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Moving on, we will hear from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.","Ben Fowke","Good morning Chris.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning Ben and Bob. Increasing transmission investment is a little bit of a newer theme for you guys or kind of a return to maybe an older theme. Just wondering if there is higher risk to this plan due to size of projects being larger or regulatory approvals that are needed here? And I know your renewable investments really tail off in the next two or three years, but I guess, to the degree that you are successful here, is there kind of upside to those renewables numbers?","Ben Fowke","Well, that's two parts to the question. I guess as the last part, we don't have any renewables scheduled because we try to sync up that renewable portfolio with our IRP plan. And as you know, Chris, we expect to retire coal plants in the mid-2020s and that's when this next round of renewables, which will be very significant, will come through. One of the benefits we have had with our Steel for Fuel program is, we have created headroom on the consumer bills to do more investment in grid infrastructure and the investment we are talking about, Chris, isn't really going to require the regulatory approval because it's not the big transmission lines I referred to when I said we are getting the band back together again. This is asset health. This is the reliability. And this is to support some of the renewables that we already have out there.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. That's good to hear. And then the incremental $1 billion of equity needs are technically over the five-year plan. Can you kind of give us a sense as to the timing and maybe structure of that within the five-year range?","Bob Frenzel","Yes. Chris, in my prepared remarks I mentioned we would probably do it over the next three years and historically the company has looked at a bunch of different products. We have used ATM programs. We have used block deals in the past. I think we look at a various mix of products. I think it will come in obviously more than one offering. And so I just think we will be measured about it and we will execute it in line with our cash needs as we look forward over the next three years.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. Thanks for that guys.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","And next up, we will take a question from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Ben Fowke","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Ben, I may have missed it right at the opening but when you look at that $22 billion five-year CapEx, obviously you roll forward. So it's not apples-to-apples with your last five-year. But even for the years that are complete in both, what's the main upside to the numbers? And in the past, you have talked about your base plan and then you have laid out, quantified your upside plan et cetera. This time, it looks like everything is in one plan. So are all of these projects now approved and ready to go? Or are there certain placeholders in this $22 billion number.","Ben Fowke","I think for the most part, this is stuff we know we can execute on. As I mentioned with the previous call, the transmission and distribution spend, those are things that are really the normal course of business. And we have a lot of opportunities to invest in our grid. I have always said, as you know, that those sorts of investments are always capped at the willingness for the consumer to pay. So to the extent we can do things like Steel for Fuel and our efficiency initiatives and take advantage of falling commodity prices, you create that headroom. So we are quite confident in the $22 billion.","Now I think your second part was and correct me if I am wrong, you wanted to know about upsides in the capital forecast?","Ali Agha","Yes. I guess it was kind of two-part as well. One, in your existing $22 billion, what has gone up versus what you were thinking when you had last put out your CapEx? And then this time you don't have like a base case, upside case. So is everything now all in one plan?","Bob Frenzel","Yes. Ali, this is Bob. I think that's the right way to think about it. We recognize that in the back years of our plan, we may have structurally under-forecasted some items. And I think we spent a lot of time with the operations in the businesses this year looking at their asset needs and trying to get everything into a single plan to make it simple and easy for the investor to understand. So I think what you are seeing here is the compilation of probably six months worth of good work by the company trying to identify projects in the back part of the plan that maybe might not have gotten identified in previous plans. So I think we have melded base and what we may have historically called upside or unidentified. I do think though and I think Ben was going to comments on upside and I think there are items that aren't embedded in this plan. I think Ben mentioned one which is a continuation of our PPA buyout strategy. We think we have got 10,000, 11,000 megawatts of PPAs that the company procures today from third-party owners and we still think that there is opportunities out there to find customer beneficial acquisitions. None of that's included in the $22 billion.","Ali Agha","Got you.","Ben Fowke","And it's clear while renewables that we put into our capital forecast usually come out of a IRP process, we believe there might be some opportunities to add some renewables still but just not identified yet which is why they are upside.","Ali Agha","Got you. And one other question. When I look at your weather normalized sales trends broken out on a quarterly pattern, third quarter we saw a pretty big negative. You had been trending positive through the first two quarters on the electric sale side. So anything that has changed that caused the negative run in the third quarter?","Ben Fowke","I will take a stab at it and maybe Bob will augment it. First of all, when we have had good quarters, we tell you don't think that as a trend. When we have a little bit off, we tell you don't take that as trend. But we did know, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, that we did have some of C&I customers that were self generating through cogen, et cetera. And that was planned. We knew about it. So that's the big issue there.","Bob Frenzel","Yes. Ali, the only thing I would add to it is, we have seen some softness in the sand mining industry and fracing in Wisconsin, some of that attributable to competing products around the country and some softness in the gas markets broadly.","Ali Agha","Got you. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. Okay. So one question. In you prepared remarks, you didn't mention anything about a potential settlement in your Colorado rate case. Should we still expect it? I see that there is an October 30 deadline for filing. Could you comment on that?","Ben Fowke","Well, listen, the time that we would get entering the settlement discussions, Angie, would be after rebuttal. So that's the period now and there has been some outreach and some work being done but we don't have anything to report to you or we would. And as you know, it's scheduled for hearing, I think, in thinking the first week of November. So maybe something will come up in that timeframe. But if we have something to report, we would tell you.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And secondly, this Mankato acquisition on a non-regulated basis, at least caught me by surprise. And you are mentioning those buyouts of existing renewable PPAs. Would those be also unregulated? Or are you talking about basically converting PPAs into rate base renewables?","Ben Fowke","Well, our approach is always going to be, let's find customer beneficial acquisition opportunities through PPAs and let's offer them to our customers. And so our plan is always to put them in rate base. In the case of Mankato, the department and ultimately the commission decided that the benefits were too back-end loaded, some variances in how we modeled those benefits and they decided that they didn't want it in rate base. However, we still believe it's a very valuable asset and that it belongs in our portfolio. So we went forward with a non-regulated base approach. But Angie, this isn't a change in strategy or anything else. We always want to see this. We wouldn't bring something to our commissions that we didn't think had a customer benefit. If there's disputes along the way, then we have to adjust to that depending on the situation. But that's always going to be Plan B, not Plan A.","Bob Frenzel","Angie, these are all still long-dated PPA contracts from the asset to one of our regulated operating companies, in this case NSP-M. So we do like the credit counterparty. We do like the optics of the transaction. I think it works for shareholders and customers alike. And so you should expect us to move forward with the Mankato one.","On the wind projects, our preference is to own them in rate base. I think they are really beneficial for the customers. But if they don't, we have made a preemptive filing at FERC to move those to wholesale as well. But again, as Ben said, I don't this is a strategic shift. It's just a recognition of their good assets that serve our customers and we are willing to own them.","Ben Fowke","Yes. And we still see plenty of opportunities, as Bob previously mentioned, to find those PPA buyout opportunities. And of course, we are in eight states, not just one or two. So they are across all of our jurisdictions.","Angie Storozynski","It's just that and I obviously accept your explanation. It's just that in a sense, you are acting as a financial investor here and typically when we see these types of acquisitions, contract base to what's seemingly similar economics, at least I would take it as a sign that you are running out of growth options in the regulated base because that's a superior growth profile, at least from a risk perspective. And I understand that Mankato could be a one-off. But you are basically saying that that's not the case here, that that was just an exceptional situation here?","Ben Fowke","Well, Angie, I have to tell you, I think we have the most transparent growth of our organic system which is the $22 billion that we put forth and we think even beyond the forecast period, we will continue to see excellent opportunities to grow the system. We are create headroom with things like Steel for Fuel to keep bills low so that we can make those investments and not overburden customers. I think that's a very important consideration. The PPA buyout strategies which is pure upside to a very robust base capital plan. And this is not a strategic change. You are not going to see us look for opportunities to come in as a financial investor. This is situation where we had some modeling differences on the benefits. Bob mentioned, we have two other wind proposals in front of the commission. The difference there is, these benefits are very much front-end loaded. And I think there is a preference in Minnesota to own renewables over gas. So we will see where that goes. But again, I think we are quite proud of the pure play vertically integrated regulated utility we are.","Angie Storozynski","Awesome. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thank you Angie.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Ben Fowke","Hi Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hi. Good morning. Just could you just may be talk a little bit more on what is happening with the MISO transmission situation on renewables and how congested it is? And just what is needed in your region to have renewables up more reasonable cost access?","Ben Fowke","Well, the work we did with CapEx 2020 opened up the door for a lot of renewables, but it's starting, to your point, to get constrained. And I do think long term, we are going to need more transmission development in the region to make sure we can continue to see renewables come into the MISO market. That said, Steve, I think we have some opportunities in the interim to squeeze out, if you will, the transmission capacity that is available and we are looking at those opportunities. And of course, some of the transmission that we are building in the next two years will help with that as well.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Is this something where you can kind of expand transmission on existing footprints? Or you need you get access to kind of new areas?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think certainly there is obviously a lot of work done with the new FERC rules on how that relates to existing transmission and repurposing and I think there will be some opportunities in the market around that.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Bob Frenzel","And I think, Steve, longer term, this is a longer term issue that we are working on and Ben said we are getting the band back together, CapEx 2020 was a very successful consortium of transmission owners in MISO that came together and formulate a plan and executed on very successfully. I think that that group is back together. They put out a press release on it three, four weeks ago trying to come up with solutions in partnership with MISO for longer term transmission access. And this is going to be probably not in our current capital plan but more like in years five through 15 where we are going to see much more regional. We expect to see more regional transmission to enable exactly what you are talking about.","Ben Fowke","It does sync up very nicely to our plans to retire coal plants. So our emphasis, particularly on MISO, will be more heavily towards solar which leads the initial tranches which have a better planning capacity, Steve, if you will than wind, which is by far the best energy type source.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just on the Colorado case, I think the settlement timeline is really in the next like week or two and it sounds like you can't really talk about whether you are going to be able to settle or not. But if we don't see something by then, should we then assume you are probably not going to be able to settle?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think you have the timeframe right. So time for settlement is right after rebuttal but before hearing. So we have got that week or two window to try to get something done. If I had something definitive to report, I would. But I don't want you to think that we are not interested in pursuing a settlement.","Ben Fowke","Steve, there is a real benefit to the settlement, but there is also from a timing perspective, the hearings are first week in November. Commission decision is expected in December and new rates in January. So the timeline is relatively compressed anyway in terms of when we go from hearing to final rates. So the clock itself is not a driver.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning team.","Ben Fowke","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, howdy. Perhaps if I can just follow-up on the last set of questions just real quickly on the MISO transmission piece. Interconnection queue issues have been around and accelerating of late. It sounds like you guys are really working on this. Can you talk a little bit about the timeline? You talk about this transmission 2020 effort. MISO is talking about MVP again. We have heard this from other peer utilities. Can you elaborate a little bit on what this process would look like, whether at MISO or with your peers and that process? Again you talk about the five to 15 year plan. But even more tangibly in the planning process in the next 12 months, how does this play out?","Bob Frenzel","I think there is still a bit of uncertainty, Julien, around the MISO transmission planning process. We are obviously a large transmission owner of MISO and are participating with them in the process. Our own group, I will call it the CapEx 2020 group, getting back together is still in its early days in terms of identifying timelines for engineering studies and how this might progress. I don't think this is a very quick process. I think this is going to take at least five years through planning before we start getting into real capital plans and construction timeframes. And so I don't want to suggest that something is going to change in the next year 12 to 18 months in terms of congestion in the MISO region. And we are seeing similar stuff in SPP as well in terms of just congestion and queues being backed up and projects being assessed with significant upgrade costs.","Ben Fowke","And Julien, remember when this does get built, we have pretty attractive right of first refusal legislation in some of our key states. So we are excited about the opportunities at the bill transmission. And without getting too specific in the details, we do see some opportunities to utilize existing transmission and other existing queue access to not slow down our plan in the meantime.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And if I can go back to the Mankato stuff just with respect to the fuel type. I suppose my initial reaction was thinking that this might be more of a gas versus renewable question. Can you talk or elaborate a little bit more about the context behind this decision? Obviously I think Angie said it before, she was surprised. How would you characterize it? Is there any specific angle here to be focused on in terms of understanding this decision versus the others proposed?","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean, it's just the weighing of the benefits. I think renewables definitely have a preference with our commission than gas, but I think it also comes down to the modeling and we are working with the department to make sure we have a more consistent modeling approach as we go into the IRP process. I think that's important, Julien.","But let me just step back, the IRRs of Mankato are good for shareholders. We think we would prefer to have Mankato owned by our customers because that's always our first preference and that's our core strategy. But we didn't want to walk away from this asset. We want it in the portfolio. And so I think shareholders will benefit and we will see what the, I am not going to speculate on what the commission does with our wind projects, but I will tell you that we are comfortable with ownership, prefer ownership on the regulated side, but it's not bad in a portfolio either.","And remember, when Bob talks about 10,000 megawatts, they are across all eight states. And it just so happens, these initial PPA buyouts came in Minnesota. But remember, we had Calpine in Colorado before and there are other opportunities in other states. And I just want to reiterate and I hope I am answering your question, we are not having a strategic change. We are definitely focused on the great organic growth opportunities we have as a regulated utility in the Upper Midwest all the way down to Texas.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Awesome. All right. Well, thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","Up next, we will hear from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Hi Travis.","Travis Miller","Hi. So just to stick on that subject real quick here on the PPA buyouts and potential growth there. Would you do the financing structure any different in terms of ParentCo versus project versus utility?","Bob Frenzel","Hi Travis, this is Bob. I think our base plan is to finance at the parent company with a mix of parent company, holding company debt and equity. I think our long term capital structure is the right way to look at any of these assets. So 60\/40 debt to equity ratio is how we think about financing the business.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. And then I wonder if you could talk both on a holistic basis across the industry and then also what you guys are seeing in terms of the PTCs, how those and ITC for the solar parts in that 2022 to 2024 time period? How do we fill in those holes and think about those tax credits if the tax policy stays the same for you guys and for the industry broadly?","Ben Fowke","Well, that's a great question. It's one of the reasons why we accelerated and really put the pedal down on our Steel for Fuel program and the biggest wind expansion in the country that we have now because we did want to lock in those PTC credits before they expired at the 100% level and even at the 80% level. You are right. I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll-off. Of course, there is a chance they won't.","Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC or most of it anyway will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself and we think that times of very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-2020. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we will clearly wait to see if there is legislation, et cetera might change that.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then just real quick, a follow-up. I know you guys and a lot of other companies have been talking about solar has been exiting, a lot of solar investment. Being a little extreme here, but what saves the wind beyond 2022 and 2023?","Ben Fowke","Well, first of all, I think wind will recover and will be attractively priced. And I think wind will always compete very nicely against solar on an energy basis. And I think you will find as more and more solar that comes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we are retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages.","Just think about it, I had farmers come up to me and say, gosh, you know, if we get we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under. So you still farm the land when you have a wind project going there. Solar, not so much. I mean you basically the land is being repurposed. And then, of course, there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines. And so I think the two will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely. And I think there is going to wind indefinitely.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. I appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.","Ben Fowke","Just one comment on that too. You have got to remember, we are in the wind belt of the United States. So it's one of the reasons why our Steel for Fuel strategies work so well. And so we are always going to have that inherent advantage.","Travis Miller","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.","Ben Fowke","Good morning Paul.","Paul Fremont","Thanks. Not to beat a dead horse to death, but when you revised your ask in Colorado, does that improve, in your mind, the possibility of reaching settlement in that case?","Ben Fowke","Yes. The short answer is yes.","Paul Fremont","Okay.","Ben Fowke","Look, if you look at what we are asking for in the case, you look at what we did with rebuttals, we have a distinct possibility, but possibilities versus something I can talk to you about explicitly, we are not there.","Paul Fremont","Okay. And then I guess a couple of questions on the CapEx revision. I am assuming for 2019 that the number that you previously had would come down by $650 million for Northern States Power because of the Mankato acquisition would be done through sort of an non-regulated entity. Is that fair?","Bob Frenzel","Yes. Paul, this is Bob. For the rate base assumption, that's correct. But for the capital assumption, we are still going to spend the capital to procure that asset.","Paul Fremont","Right. So it would like go to other, right, I would assume?","Bob Frenzel","Correct.","Paul Fremont","Okay.","Bob Frenzel","That's the way to think about it.","Paul Fremont","And then it looks like there is a $735 million pickup for Northern States Power Minnesota in 2020. Can you sort of give us what's driving that?","Bob Frenzel","I think the largest driver of that is sort of wind movements across plan years. So previously we were going to have a build-own-transfer project with our Cheyenne wind project. We are going to build that ourselves. And we moved a bunch of that capital into 2019 to get it built in time for 100% PTC. In 2020, some of the wind has moved from 2019 into 2020. And so that's probably the bigger pickup in the NSPM territory. In total, capital for 2019 is expected to be in line with our original guidance of $5.1 billion.","Paul Fremont","And then there is another sort of big pickup of almost $1 billion in your spend in 2022. Can you give us some ideas as to what's driving that?","Bob Frenzel","I think big picture, Ben talked about a lot of that and it's a lot of investments in our network for the transmission, distribution and gas networks. That's big spend year for us for our advanced grid initiatives. And that's when we start spending additional dollars in the gas networks as well. So again, we spent a lot of money in renewables over the last three or four years. We have created a significant amount of customer bill headroom and we are starting to look at the networks businesses a little more carefully and we have seen both need and opportunity there.","Paul Fremont","Great. I think that's it in terms of questions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Sophie Karp","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, I was just wondering about Minnesota and following the Mankato docket and I think you have a rate case there coming up. Is your regulatory strategy is changing in that state? Is there any consideration that maybe you would approach differently?","Ben Fowke","No, I don't think so. We plan to file for interim rates in the first week of November. I don't see anything too controversial with that. We expect the rates to go into place. And then we will process the case. I am not sure, we still see the same alignment with our strategy and we expect a constructive outcome.","So that answers your question, Sophie. I want to make sure I did.","Sophie Karp","Yes. So it sounds like you don't expect your Mankato acquisition that you are now doing as merchant asset to color the rate case proceeding in anyway?","Ben Fowke","No, not at all. No, there is no strained relationship at all around that. It's just a difference of the commission deciding we don't think there is enough benefit. We think there was a lot of benefit and still do. But no reflection upon strain in the relationship.","Sophie Karp","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Hi. Good morning. How are you doing.","Ben Fowke","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","So I wanted to touch base with you on the transmission. As you know, there have been some voices concerned the cost containment and what have you in that area. And we have recently had FERC put out an order and some comments as well, I guess, from certain commissioners about the FERC Order 1000 really hasn't worked out as they thought it would in terms of providing the level of competition that they wanted to. And so, I was just wondering if you could sort of talk about how you see that issue or those issues related to competition in transmission? And I think it was last week, we had a FERC order as well associated with touching on this as well. How we should think about what the outlook might be with respect to this reported concern?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think that's a really good question. I don't think the barrier to getting transmission done, which is really what we are trying to get accomplished, is not about the competitive process In fact, if you look at the biggest transmission build, it was done with CapEx 2020, as I mentioned. And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how cost would be allocated because the real barriers to getting transmission build is, who pays for it and then of course the permitting and everything else that goes with that.","So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it and it's not necessary and we will see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we have got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We are not an RTO in Colorado. I think there is some real advantages to that. But we will get this transmission built. And we are being realistic in the time it takes to get it built.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital.","Ben Fowke","Hi Vedula.","Vedula Murti","Just wanted to follow-up little bit on the Mankato discussion we are having. You referenced the strong internal IRRs. How does it compete in terms of just picking more from capital allocation perspective versus other capital opportunities you have across the system in terms of choosing this capital allocation?","Ben Fowke","Well, the Mankato project is certainly, the returns are certainly above our cost of capital and an attractive from a shareholders' perspective as a result.","Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?","Bob Frenzel","No. I think the expectations over the life of the asset, it looks like our utility like return are consolidated corporate returns. We have stated that it's a little bit lower on the front-end and a little bit higher on the back-end, just given the structure of the contracts. But otherwise, I agree with Ben's comments.","Ben Fowke","Let me just add that when we talk about utility like returns over the life, that is with very, in our opinion, very conservative modeling. I do think that the trend towards anti-gas makes existing gas assets valuable. And we are retiring coal plants and we are keenly focused on reliability. So Vedula, we really thought it was important to keep it in our portfolio because I think that the value of existing gas assets is only going to grow and this is a CC plant that we modeled very, very conservatively. So it's reason why we did not want to walk away from this one.","Vedula Murti","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions. I will turn the conference back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks.","Bob Frenzel","Thank you very much for your participation in our call today. As always, if you have any questions, please follow-up with investor relations.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn our conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Johnson","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss earning guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin Fowke","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today we reported third quarter earnings of $0.97 per share compared to $0.90 per share last year. We are very pleased to report another solid quarter.","With the first three quarters of the year behind us, we are narrowing our full year guidance range to $2.27 to $2.32 per share. We're also initiating 2018 earning guidance of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. We're also updating our five-year capital forecast. And as you know, we're making significant capital investments and renewables.","So let me provide you an update of our Steel-for-Fuel investment strategy. In August in response to our resource plan, we filed a stipulation agreement to create the Colorado Energy Plan. The proposal is a bold step and the continuing transition of our generation portfolio and contemplates the early retirement of two coal units at our Comanche Plan and the addition of up to 1,000 megawatts wind, 700 megawatts of solar and 700 megawatts of natural gas and\/or storage.","As part of the agreement, we have an ownership target of 50% of the renewable additions and 75% on natural gas and storage investment which could lead to an incremental investment of up to 1.59 billion rather dollars. We believe this is a great opportunity for all stakeholders. Our Colorado business could achieve 55% renewable energy by 2026 and carbon emission reductions of 60% from 2005 levels. And we believe the plan can be implemented without cost increases to customers. We expect our commission decision by the summery of 2018.","Continuing on the Steel-for-Fuel theme, in September, we proposed the Dakota Range project, which is a 300-megawatt wind farm that we are planning to build and own in South Dakota. This is the first announced wind project that will go into service in 2021. With total capital cost in the range of 1,200 to 1,200 a KW, this project is cost competitive even with the PTC at the 80% level. Improvement in wind technology and supply chain, are expected to continue and proves that wind can be economical beyond the PTC period.","As with our other wind projects, there are significant cost savings to customers from the Dakota Range project. We've requested that the Minnesota commission approved the project by March 2018.","Next, I'll provide a quick update on our SPS wind proposal. As you will recall, we have proposed to add 1,000 megawatts of self-build wind in two locations in Texas and New Mexico. In addition, we have proposed a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. Our proposal provides significant cost savings and environmental benefits which our customers will realize as soon as the wind farms go into operation. In October, interveners provided initial testimony and as expected, they push back on our cost recovery mechanisms. This project is a $1.6 billion investment and represents approximately 40% of SPS's rate base, because this is a substantial investment and stakeholders will rely immediate benefits and savings, we need some of current recovery to offset regulatory lag in order to forward these wind projects.","This week, we filed our Rebuttal testimony in Texas and proposed some measures to address intervener concerns. We've had many meetings with our stakeholders and are cautiously optimistic, we can reach a settlement that works for everyone. We expect final decisions on this proposal by the end of firth quarter in 2018.","As the company has progress on our clean energy transition and Steel-for-Fuel strategy, there's been a lot of investor focus on our long-term earnings growth target. After careful consideration of our plans, we have tightened our long-term EPS targets of 5% to 6% annual growth. I feel very confident, we can deliver EPS growth within this range based up on our current plans. And of course as always, we are focused on delivering earnings at the top end of that range.","With that let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?","Robert Frenzel","Thanks Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter with earnings of $0.97 per share compared with $0.90 per share last year. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric margin which increased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to rate increases and non-fuel riders to recovery our capital investments, offset by production tax credits that flew back to our customers. Lower O&M expenses largely due to timing increased earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower effective tax rate reflects increased wind product tax credits, the resolution of tax appeals and an increase in research and experimentation credits.","Keep in mind the PTCs will back to the customers through base rates, riders of the fuel cost don't have a material impact on net income. Offsetting these positive drivers where increase depreciation expense reflecting our capital investment program which reduced earnings by $0.05.","Higher taxes other than income primarily property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and higher conservation and DSM expenses which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. Those expenses are offset by higher corresponding revenues.","Turning to sales, on a weather and leap year adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales improved 0.2%, reflecting approximately 1% growth in the number of customers across those customer class and jurisdictions offset by lower use per customers.","Natural gas sales increased 1.8% year-to-date on a weather and leap year adjusted basis, reflecting continued customer growth, partially offset by a decline in use per customer.","Our year-to-date electric sales are growing consistent with our annual growth forecast of 0% to 0.5%, while our natural gas sales growing a little bit better than expected.","We continue to focus on our O&M expenses. Quarter-over-quarter, O&M cost declined $49 million, while year-to-date, O&M expense were $58 million. The quarter and year-to-date O&M underrun largely reflects the timing of plan outages and transmission and distribution line maintenance. We expect most of the year-to-date underrun to reverse in the fourth quarter, in addition, we expect incremental pension and benefit costs in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we expect annual O&M to be consistent with 2016 with some potential favorability. This would be the fourth consecutive year of near flat O&M expenses.","Next, I'll provide a regulatory update. Please note that there are additional details on each cash included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we have pending request to increase electric rates by $25 million and natural rates by $12 million. Gas and intervener testimony since submitted and hearings that's included. We anticipate a commission decision in December and final rates to be effective in January of 2018.","In Texas, we have a pending electric case, seeking a net increase of $55 million. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of 2018 with final rates to be implemented retroactively to January of 2018. And in Colorado, we filed a multiyear natural gas case seeking a $139 million increase over three years. NM rates will be implemented in January and final rates expected to be effective in March of 2018.","We also recently filed a multiyear electric case in Colorado seeking $245 million increase over four years. Final rates are expected to be effective in June of 2018. In addition, we are also planning to file a New Mexico electric case later this week.","Turning to earnings guidance based on our year-to-date results were narrowing our full year 2017 earnings guidance range $2.27 to $2.32 per share. Our previously guidance range was $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And while our year-to-date earnings are $0.12 per share ahead of last year. Keep in mind that we expect our year-to-date O&M underrun to largely reverse in the fourth quarter.","We also initiating our 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share, which is consistent with our revise long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 6% annually.","Please note that our 2018 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are listed in the earnings release. I want to highlight a couple of them here. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect modest electric sales growth of 0% to 0.5% per year. And finally, we expect O&M expenses to remain flat, but we work to continue improve efficiency and drive costs out of the business.","In our earnings release you will find our updated five-year capital forecast which reflects investment of $19 billion in our base capital plan and drives annual rate base growth of 5.5%. Our base capital plan includes the SPS wind proposal and the Dakota Range project. Our base capital forecast does not include any potential investments for the recently proposed Colorado Energy plan which result an incremental capital investment of up to $1.5 billion. This incremental capital investment would result in approximately 6.3% annual rate base growth through 2022.","We've also updated our financing plan. In addition to reinvesting our cash flow back into infrastructure and our operating companies, operating company and holding company there to fund our capital plan. And for the past several years, we've used market purchases for our benefits programs, however going forward, we expect issue approximately $75 million to $80 million of DRIP and benefits equity per year. This will allow us to maintain our solid credit metrics with an expanded capital investment program. Additional details are included in our earnings release.","And finally tax performance back in the news. In September where public and leadership and the administration release the high-level framework that would service a template for legislation that we expect to be released in draft form next week. There is a lot of uncertainly on the potential outcome given the complicated nature of comprehensive tax reform. But our position on tax reform hasn't changed. We believe a lower corporate tax rate is good for the economy, our customers, Xcel Energy and the utilities sector. And we believe the preservation of interest deductibility and bonus depreciation are expensing a capital is in the best interest of our customers.","And finally we believe the transition rules are important to the implementation and we work within to ensure any new legislation and regulation is implemented in a matter that best protect for customer interest. While any final legislation could take many forms, we are confident that we can manage the impacts of potential tax reform and deliver on our earnings and dividend growth objectives.","With that I'll ramp up overall with an excellent quarter, we filed our proposed Colorado Energy plan which approved, we continue our clean energy transition and add substantial renewable generation and significantly reduce submissions with no incremental costs to our customers.","We proposed the Dakota Range project which represents the first wind project plan for 2021 and it is cost competitive and results in customer savings even with the phase down of the production tax credits.","We progressed our regulatory initiatives and are engaged in rate proceedings in Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and soon to be New Mexico. We provided updated capital plans that provide transparency and support our 5% to 6% earnings and 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. And finally we posted strong financial results for the quarter and are well positioned to deliver earnings within our narrowed guidance range of $2.27, $2.32 per share.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Hey, good morning.","Benjamin Fowke","Good morning, Julien and welcome back.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Perhaps just first quick question. You never stop asking for more expose but congrats on moving the guidance range up but suppose the first question I love to hear you and spell out the plan little bit more detail is on the upside case of the Colorado, just the timing of the capital there and ultimately the regulatory recovery scheme and how you are thinking about that phase again, basically at what points in time will you be filing and what point in time do you expect to actually see that capital play out and what point would you eventually get comfortable put that another plan?","Benjamin Fowke","Okay, well, here is where we are, Julien. We have request for proposals out. We expect to get those proposals in and be in a position to make a recommendation to the commission in the first quarter of next year. We are hopeful for a favorable decision in the summer of 2018. As far as timing goes, I think a lot of that will depend upon the proposals themselves and what comes in and what makes sense. So you know you are probably starting so I mean could just ask the native for you probably in the 2021, 2022 timeframe, but how that would lay in, I think we got to see what is presented to us and then we have better handle on that.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Got it. Alright, fair enough. And then turning back to Texas, New Mexico just recovery there, the plan et cetera, can you talk about perhaps at a high level how you are thinking about moving forward to those projects and ultimately, I'll leave it as high level as asking expectations and earned through the construction project and what sort of palatable to you all in both those jurisdictions?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, if you saw our Rebuttal testimony that we've filed in Texas, you see that - I think we've addressed the intervener concerns and you know are willing to do reasonable symmetrical cost gaps, reasonable performance guarantees, certainly if we get a decision when we want the decision, we can make sure that the PTs will be eligible for the PTCs, in this case a 100%. And I think we're - our revised idea for recovery is one that I think makes all the sense in the world that before they go into rate base but rather an operation, we'll enjoy the PTC and any market sales of the project that included benefit of our shareholders.","So if you put all that together, then that would be the kind of return that we would need to be able to move forward.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Got it. So you think kind of consistent level of earn return in that jurisdiction still?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, we want to see the returns get better.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Okay. So you think it's possible maybe just in light of what you're proposing in Rebuttal et cetera to be improving ROE and see that capital deployment happen said differently?","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, the short answer is yeah. This is 40% of the SPS rate base and we'd get better recovery of investments than we typically get now which as you know in historic test your mode even in New Mexico where there's a forward test year but to date the commission has found a way to throw those type those cases out.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Excellent. Well, best of luck and congratulations.","Benjamin Fowke","Thanks. Good to have you back.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin Fowke","Good morning.","Ali Agha","If the Colorado project does get approved and you add the 1.5 billion CapEx to you plan, what does that do to the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, let's start with rate base, it would take rate base up to from 5.5% to about 6.3%. So that clearly gives and that is as the engine for EPS growth rate. So 6.3% is at the top end of the 5% to 6%.","Ali Agha","Okay. But would you assume more equity in the mix to kind of the dilute some of that rate base falling all the way to EPS growth?","Benjamin Fowke","I think there's a lot of variables that go into that Ali, I mean right now, we're comfortable with the DRIP program and again as I mentioned to - July on the prior call, I think it has to do with - we would have to look at the timing of when that those capital expenditures would take place.","Ali Agha","Okay. Also within your base plan Ben, then what have you assumed in terms of the trend line in your earned ROE, have you assumed significant pick up or just remind us what's the lag and what do you assume happens to the lag over that four, five-year period?","Robert Frenzel","Hey, Ali. It's Bob. You know look, when we look at a regulated ROEs and where we've been on objective is to close ROE gap. I think we've done a reasonable amount of progress in that regard. But as the headline allowed to come down slightly, I think where we are year-to-date where we expect to be for the forecast period is somewhere in that high eights range of earned ROEs in the regulated operating companies.","Ali Agha","Okay. So Bob in other words, you're assuming your earned ROEs remain relatively steady or flattish over this period?","Robert Frenzel","That's correct.","Ali Agha","I see. Okay. And then lastly looking at load growth just for the third quarter, we did see a decline in weather normalized electric sales, you have been trending fairly, nicely and positively through the first half. Anything to read into that is that have any implication as you're looking at load growth going forward?","Robert Frenzel","I wouldn't read too much into that it's more of a function, we had a pretty solid Q3 last year and so relative comparison in Q3 over Q3 looks a little bit down. Through the full year, we're still slightly up and within our guidance range. And if you look at the trend over a multi-year period, we're still very much in line with our expectations. So Q3 of 2016 was probably a stronger quarter and the relative comparison is down.","Ali Agha","I see. Thank you","Robert Frenzel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good morning. I was wondering on the Colorado, we stay with Colorado here for a second. Is there any kind of overlap between the multiyear especially when you go out to 2020 and 2021 and the energy plan?","Benjamin Fowke","Is there any kind of overlap...?","Travis Miller","Just in terms of infrastructure build or anything that would be necessary to support that energy plan?","Benjamin Fowke","I don't know if there's really an overlap, I don't know if you're referring to recovery. We do have David Eves here that runs our Colorado operations. So David, if there is any additional detail, you could?","David Eves","Yeah. The electric rate case that we filed four your plan through 2021 doesn't include any projections or cost recovery for the Colorado energy plan. Those would be recovered under the recovery mechanisms we proposed in a plan like through the ECA.","Travis Miller","Okay. Okay. And then quick dividend question?","David Eves","I don't mind then that you get proposing concurrent recovery.","Travis Miller","Okay, for the energy plan?","David Eves","Yes.","Travis Miller","Yeah. Okay. And then a quick dividend question. I think where we recall, you had said that 60% to 70% payout target for the next couple of years and I was wondering how that might be affected with any of the incremental investment that you might get in particularly the Colorado investment?","David Eves","You know Travis, we haven't changed our guidance on either dividend growth or dividend payout expectations with regard to the base case forecast or with regard to the Colorado energy plan.","Travis Miller","Okay. So you still think you could potentially go up to that 70% is still the 60% to 70% range?","Benjamin Fowke","I mean I think if we grow our earnings at where we think they are along with the projected dividend thing that's going to - it would take a long time for kick at the 70%. But stepping back Travis and I think you've heard me say this before, the modest payout ratio that we have I think gives as that dry powder and the event you start to see rates rise. We can do more to reward our shareholders by rethinking the pace of our dividend increases. I'm not saying we're going to do that, but it's kind of all part of our plan to make sure that we don't - we always have dry powder whether it's on the operational side, the financial side, dividend projections. so that we can continue to reward shareholders on a number of different scenarios.","Travis Miller","Okay Great. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning.","Benjamin Fowke","Hi, Stephen. Good morning.","Stephen Byrd","Wanted to talk about your Colorado energy plan and you mentioned the potential for either gas or storage. When you think about the economics of gas generation relative to storage, what is your sense of the trend the likelihood that over time storage will become so cheap that it's likely to become more advantageous as a resource relative to gas by generation, what's your sense for where you might end up there?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I tell you what when you look at what we're doing now with renewables and our Steel-for-Fuel and the price point that they're coming in at, those prices there's no way I would have ever thought it would be possible eight years ago. So I never short change what technology can do. Right now though Stephen, it is batteries and are relatively low-cost jurisdictions don't compete economically, there might be some opportunities in some areas deploy then, but I think it's important to recognize that they're going to continue to fall in price.","You know will they ever be the new peaker? I think there's going to be system grid reliability limitations on how much of that could happen. And from a planning capacity, there are differences between a battery and something that is can be fired up 24\/7 for days at a time. But you can see more batteries on our system, that's the bottom line and will be positioned to make sure that becomes increasingly more of a mainstream part of our portfolio, while at the technology move at the speed of the value. And in the meantime, we'll do things like we are doing which is pilot programs et cetera to really understand all the various economics, the grid capabilities and reliability, batteries bring to the table.","So long winded answer to your question, we'll see what the resource plan brings to us and then we'll made the right economic decisions for our customers.","Stephen Byrd","That's very, very helpful color. And just longer term we been having great success with the growth of renewable. Is there a point at which storage needs to start or gas or both become sort of incrementally you much more significant or do you think it's fairly linear, in other words do you reach a point where you get such a degree of renewals that you have to significantly step up a gas for generation and\/or storage or do you think it's more just sort of a steady progression that we'll see?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I think what we're going to do is we are we're going to have more renewables on our system I believe than anybody else in this timeframe, certainly more wind. And so you do have load following resources and I think that's what you mean by the gas technology. I think that's where batteries can play a role. I think it also requires you to start rethinking about your demand response programs et cetera making sure that you can shift load to a degree. Where the practical limitations on renewable and on the system and I can tell you I'm working with our operational people and learning all about system and things like that because I mean at some point as you know you can't - with today's technology, you cannot truly be one 100% renewable within your own grid. You always have to have another place to move and excess power and bring in power when you need it, but you can get really, really close.","And I think if you look at what we're talking about in our vision case and in Minnesota what we're talking about in Colorado, I don't think anybody would have thought these things would have been practical five, ten years ago and certainly not out of the price point that doesn't raise costs for customers. Did I answer your question?","Stephen Byrd","Yeah, it does. I mean I guess I'm thinking about longer term, it sounds like you're doing a lot of assessment in terms of how your grid is going to change and thinking about items like inertia which are way beyond my capability understand but it sounds like stay tuned but it - my sense it sounds like storage and load volumes, it's going to be an important part of that equation?","Benjamin Fowke","All of the above is going to be important.","Stephen Byrd","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Fowke","Hi Christopher.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning. If I remember correctly last year when you started to have success on the Minnesota renewable front then you were kind of discussing the impact on your overall rate base growth and CapEx plan, you deferred some other spending at least hypothetically to limit the positive impact there. If I kind of reverse the situation now and say you have 5.5% rate base growth to the plan, let's say you are not successful with any of the on approval renewable projects, you might get down below 5%. Are there other things that you can pull forward that are on the back burner right now that would bring you up to a slightly more competitive rate base growth well?","Benjamin Fowke","The short answer is yes. We could - I think when I made those comments that you referred to, it's really about how much great investment you do and while those great investments are credibly beneficial to our customers that does come with a price tag, so we want to be very mindful of that. But we have other capital we could bring forward or other opportunities that we could seek, I mean look at the deal - the Dakota Range budget as an example of that. So I have no doubt that we will need our rate base growth projections.","Christopher Turnure","Okay.","Robert Frenzel","Keep in mind the base case does not include the Colorado energy plan which is $1.5 billion, so that could very easily move into base which would potentially offset any departures of other capital.","Christopher Turnure","Sure. Yes certainly there are plenty of ways to do in here. And then switching gears to the Colorado gas case, I think this has been one area where lag has been a bit more pronounced if I'm not mistaken. Could you maybe help us understand how the staff recommendation as it pertains to forward looking rate making and maybe the multi-year angle or lack thereof dove tails with the commissions kind of investigation of that is as ordered back in June and I think maybe they ordered the ALJ to look into the further potential for forward looking in multi-year rates?","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, I'm going to turn it over to David Eves again, but I think the success we've had with our multi-year plans on the electric case gives me a lot of optimism that we can do the same on the gas side. Particularly when you look at where that - what those investments are which is making sure that our gas system is reliable and safe.","David Eves","Christopher, this is David. The commissioners when they referred this to an administrative law judge made it pretty clear that they wanted a policy and full consideration of future test years in a multi-year plan. We're disappointed that the staff even though OCC addressed it somewhat the staff really sidestep the issue and did not address the future test years in the multi-year plan. We still think we have a really good case and we'll address that in our rebuttal coming on November 3rd.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. But it's not like you're confident in the commission and there kind of just in general the direction that they're going in despite what just asset?","David Eves","Yeah, I think we're confident. I think we have - we feel like we have a really strong case and you'll see that with our rebuttal. It's also the gas revenue requirement is really a capital driven. We're investing very significantly and the basic system but also in all the integrity work and part of this plan is to replace the PSIA with for a test year multi-year plan. So I think it's set up well.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Benjamin Fowke","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Question on the, so you put the DRIP in the plan now, I see the financing plan which was not before, presumably that's probably the function of higher CapEx, but did you make a specific tax reform assumption in there? That was one question. And then secondly, should we - when should we assume switched on, is it later in the plan or is it more linear?","Robert Frenzel","Yeah, Jon, it's Bob. I don't think we made any direct consideration on tax reform with respect to turning on the DRIP. If you remember the share repurchase program was initiated when the capital environment was you know 4ish billion dollars less than it is today. So with consideration for credit and everything else, I think we wanted to make sure that we had a very conservative plan that maintained our credit rating and a modest amount of DRIP equity annually was enough in our opinion to maintain that profile.","When you ask about when do you turn it back off, I think it just depends on what the future capital profile and opportunities for investment for the company. We see a long runway for capital investment at this rate and so at this point, we would consider keeping it on including\u2026","Jonathan Arnold","Actually, Bob, my question was when do you turn it on, do you turn it on like in 2018 or is it more the back end of the plan?","Robert Frenzel","Sorry, we expect turn it on in 2018.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then so then by extension if you do incremental CapEx that's outside of the current plan, is it reasonable to assume, you'd address that through stepping up DRIP. Could you do more, or might you look for another type of equity?","Robert Frenzel","Yeah, I think as Ben mentioned earlier on the call, we think that even with the Colorado Energy Plan we think DRIP would be sufficient equity for our financing plan for the five-year period.","Jonathan Arnold","Yeah, okay.","Robert Frenzel","It depends Jonathan on the timing of when that CapEx would come through.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And but this level of DRIP, this is presumably not what you could have raised, you could do more than that under DRIP on gas?","Robert Frenzel","No, because DRIP is - I mean DRIP is, when we say DRIP, we're talking about dividend reinvestment plan, so that's going to be what it is and our benefit plan as well and so it's not really. I mean it's that $75 million, $80 million kind of equity issuance every year.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. All right, great. Thank you. And then could I just on the sort of revised proposals and but I may have missed this, I apologize if I am going over something you covered but what's your level of confidence that what you put on the table in Texas now for the SPS wind project is kind of going to tick the boxes you need to take and then you can stay on time?","Robert Frenzel","I think it's - first of all Jonathan, you were very quick to summarize that Rebuttal testimony. SoI enjoyed your report. But I think it's - I mean I think it's very responsive to the concerns while still recognizing that we need to have better recovery for this level of investment particularly when you look at the compelling customer benefits to come along with it.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Can I ask just sort of one sort of point in detail on that, when you guarantee the 100% PTC, is that in the sense of in case the projects delayed beyond the deadline to get the full PTC or is that more around this deferred tax issue and the fact that you want customers to get the full benefit even if you're not able to fully realize it on a current basis?","Robert Frenzel","No. it has to do with getting it in service in time to make sure it qualifies for the 100% PTC eligibility. Now, we do ask in a testimony as you know that our willingness to do that is based upon a commission decision I believe in March of 2018, which would allow the time we need to actually get it constructed.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Great thank you, Bob.","Robert Frenzel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So just looking at you know Midwestern utilities pushing more renewables in the rate base, I mean I understand the energy aspect of the appeal of these investment, but we're starting to see first indications that intervene want some offset to the existing generation capacity because these assets do have some megawatts as well as the energy component. And so I mean how likely is it that we could see some betterment to the rate base growth because you would be forced for incidence either write down our shutdown some and appreciate coal plant or gas plants that currently existing of rate base along with the additions of new wind farms?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I can't speak for all of the Midwest utilities but speaking for itself, I think we've done a very good job of developing comprehensive plans that when we do talk about shutting down plants and for example in Minnesota, one and two units that we get the recovery associated with that shutdown. And in fact Angie if you look at what we're talking about in Colorado, we contemplate accelerating the depreciation of the Comanche one and two plants through a what's known as the reason mechanism, so that is taken care of and the cost of all of that and both of those plans still comes in at a price that's great for consumers. So we definitely look at that risk and we address it in the plans that we put forward to our stakeholders.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. My second question, so assuming the tax reform that's happened and the CapEx deductions are extended, would you consider using a tax equity investors to monetize the PTC's especially under the scenario where you in a way share this benefit up front and then the cash true up of that benefit from your perspective it would be delayed if the in-effect bonus depreciation would be extended?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I mean I think you'd have to see what sort of scenarios roll out, but I think one of the scenario that I think been pretty successful advocating for, I don't think we'd have the need to do that. You got to keep in mind Angie that this the way I look at these wind proposals as a deeply, deeply in the money hedge against gas prices. So there's room for these projects to get essential a little more expensive on the different tax reform scenarios and still bid deeply in the money.","We have a great cost of capital and tax equity as you probably know is very, very expensive. So and of course under those scenarios, you mention it probably would get more expensive. So I think putting in rate base and delivering the kind of level cost of energy to our customers that we anticipate is the right path forward.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And last question. So the rebuttal testimony in support of those wind investments for SPS, okay so the way I understood it is that you're basically trying to shield the earning during this say 18-month periods between when the asset would start operations and we could actually get the rates. But how would that help you increase of realize ROE I mean that's very, but I mean to me it just seems more like you're basically trying not to have a detrimental to the ROE as opposed an improvement?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I mean you're trying to - I think it depends on how the market conditions would unfold but you're talking about a proposal when it - by the time it's operational in between operation and in service because we are in historic tax year and taxes that we would enjoy the production tax credits in any market sales, that's what you're talking about?","Angie Storozynski","Yes, yeah.","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, well I think there's some variability in that based on the market sales, but the PTCs would be fairly compelling. And again I like a rider a forward rider, but we're also wanting to see these projects get done, they're great for our customers and the mechanism that we talked about while not our first choice is something we can live with and not see lag associate with those particular projects.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Fowke","Hi Paul.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. If maybe you answered this and I didn't pick it up, but if the Colorado Energy Plan were approved, would that $1.5 billion kind of push other projects off the stack or delay them or could you fully absorb that along with all the other projects?","Robert Frenzel","Hey, Paul. It's Bob. Our expectation is that when depends a lot on the timing of the proposal that we receive in the recommendations we make to the committee, but I think our proposal would be that we would keep the Colorado Energy Plan as incremental to our base capital plan. And we look at any changes year-over-year that might be necessary, but the bottom line is assuming it comes in and when we think it would which is 2020, 2021, 2022 that we'd be able to manage that capital profile.","Paul Ridzon","That was you said 2020, 2021, 2022, is there a comma between the three numbers are that 2020, 2021 and 2022?","Robert Frenzel","Sorry 2020, 2021 and 2022.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Benjamin Fowke","Hey Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just to make sure on the CapEx and rate base numbers, does that include all of the SPS wind CapEx and if the Mexico for incidence doesn't happen or what have you, you have to have both in Mexico and Texas for those for the SPS when proposals happen?","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, Paul, we proposed two projects, one in New Mexico, one in Texas, but we run the system on an integrated basis and our approval process would look to go to both Texas and the Mexico for approvals for both projects.","Robert Frenzel","So Paul, you are asking in the $19 billion, what's included in the base is the assumption that our proposals that SPS go through, so that's in the base, but as we mention what's not in the base is the Colorado Energy Plan.","Paul Patterson","Right. Okay. But just if the full amount of the SPS wind in the base, right?","Benjamin Fowke","Yes, including and also in Minnesota the upper Midwest rather the Dakota Range project.","Paul Patterson","Right. And then just what I was asking, I apologize if it wasn't clear. Is it - there was a problem in New Mexico or something is that, would that basically - with that impact - how would that impact the SPS wind project, do you follow what I am saying, do you need both of them in order for them?","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, I mean I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it but the ideal you get approval from both as Bob's point, we run the system on an integrated basis. But there have been times where we have allocated a project specifically to a jurisdiction. It can be done, it's not ideal but it can be done.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Okay, that's it. All other questions been answered. Thank you.","Benjamin Fowke","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn it back to Bob Frenzel for any additional remarks.","Robert Frenzel","Thanks everyone for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing in Orlando.","Operator","And that does conclude conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect."],"22619":["Xcel Energy Inc.

Welcome to the Xcel Energy Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paul Johnson","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if necessary.","This morning, we will review our 2014 full year results, reaffirm our 2015 earnings guidance range and update you on strategic plans related to business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our Web page. In addition, we will post a brief video on our Web site of Teresa summarizing our financial results later this morning.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Fowke","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'm going start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014 and update you on some exciting developments at Xcel Energy. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. 2014 was another strong year for Xcel Energy as the Company reported earnings of $2.03 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive year we\u2019ve met or exceeded our earnings guidance and the fifth consecutive year we delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In addition, we raised our dividend for the 11th year in a row.","From a regulatory perspective, we made significant progress, wrapping up rate cases in Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas. We received a constructive ALJ recommendation in Minnesota and most recently reached a favorable three year settlement in our Colorado electric case. When we filed the case in Colorado, we stated that our objective was to establish a multi-year regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. This settlement accomplishes that goal and provides us a reasonable opportunity during our authorized return in our Colorado electric business over the next three years.","From an operational perspective I also wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the efforts of our employees this year. We hit record levels of safety in 2014 improving for the seventh straight year. And again we demonstrated our top tier operating performance with industry leading reliability scores.","Recall last quarter we unveiled our refreshed strategic plan that was focused on improving utility performance, including the goal of closing the ROE gap by 50 basis points and increasing the amount of revenue generated from long term regulatory agreement. Driving operational excellence by focusing on limiting annual increases and O&M cost to between 0% and 2%, providing our customers more options and solutions and finally investing for the future by focusing on incremental growth opportunities in our natural gas and transmission businesses.","Today, we\u2019re excited to update on the progress we\u2019ve made on some of these initiatives. The electric utility industry is in the midst of a major transition and we\u2019re committed to be on the front end of this change. We will be a leader in the same way we proactively implemented our environmental strategy over a decade ago. To this end we are pursuing regulatory changes to better align with the clear direction that customer preferences, federal policies and state initiatives are moving.","Las month in Minnesota a collaborative report was issued by a diverse stakeholder group known as the e21 initiative. The group released a set of recommendations that are intended to act as a blueprint for a new customer centric performance based regulatory approach. Following the e21 report, we filed with the Minnesota commission a framework on how we envision enabling these changes. We focused on four key objectives; lowering carbon emission by 40% by 2013; pioneering distribution grid modernization; responding to changing customer preferences and providing new services and products; and finally pursuing more predictable and nimble rate recovery.","In order to effectively bring about these changes, it is essential that the company have a longer term more holistic regulatory compact. Longer term multi-year agreements and additional writers are expected to improve visibility and supplement our efforts. Further the company has tools they can utilize to stabilize rate increases and make bills more predictable for our customers. We expect to work with the commission and various stakeholders in Minnesota in 2015 to develop this new regulatory framework and have requested a planning meeting in the coming months to discuss potential options in greater detail.","We\u2019re also exploring ways for us to avoid the need to file a 2016 rate case which will allow more time to concentrate on the longer term regulatory framework. In January we filed our resource plan in Minnesota which provides details on how we will achieve our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This will be accomplished by significantly increasing the amount of solar and wind on the NSP system, adding natural gas generation, continuing our industry leading commitment to conservation programs, operating our nuclear plans at least through their current licenses and continuing to run Sherco Units 1 and 2 with gradual decreased reliance on those units to 2030. This proactive no regret strategy will better position the company and our customers for the long run and do so at an incremental cumulative cost of less than 3% to 2030. As a result, by 2030 63% of our energy will be carbon free at NSP. Clearly 2015 is going to be a transformational year in Minnesota. ","While much of our discussion is focused on Minnesota, we're also pursuing changes in our Texas jurisdiction. Along with other non-ERCOT utilities, we will be sponsoring legislation this session that will help reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to invest in the system to support growth in the region, which is continuing even in the face of a challenging oil price environment. ","Finally, we wanted to update you on our natural gas growth initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to file a general rate case for our Colorado gas business, but finally we'll include a number of investments to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure. Concurrent with our rate case, we will begin working with our commission and major stakeholders to explore rate basing natural gas reserves as a way to take advantage of the current low natural gas price and to provide a longer-term hedge for our customers. Following our stakeholder and outreach and education, we expect to make a separate filing to begin the regulatory process. We're excited by the progress we've made and the steps we've taken thus far and I look forward to updating you later this year. ","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa Madden","Thanks Ben and good morning. Today I'll be focusing my discussion on full year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share. The most significant drive related to 2014 earnings was improved electric and natural gas margins that benefited from new rates and increased rider revenues in many of our jurisdictions. Increased margins more than offset an unfavorable weather comparison and higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. It is worth noting that the weather in 2014 contributed $0.03 per share when compared to normal. In contrast in 2013, weather contributed $0.11 per share resulting in a $0.08 per share decline when comparing the two years.","Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. We experienced positive growth trends in 2014, with weather normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.3% and firm natural gas sales improving 4.6%. Sales in 2014 exceeded our original expectations for the year. While we are monitoring economic conditions in our service territories and are closely watching potential implications from changes in the E&P space. We remain confident in our 2015 electric weather adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%. ","Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP was constant, weather adjusted retail sales increased 3.3% in 2014, due to strength in C&I sales from growth in the sand mining industry and related oil and gas businesses. Customer growth and modest usage increases drove higher residential sales. Electric sales at SPS increased 2.3% driven by growth in the C&I class. Oil and gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory and we saw additional growth in uranium enrichment. While we are watching the oil price closely and expect some producers to reduce new drilling activity, we anticipate that others will continue to grow production. PSCo sales increased 1.2% which was primarily attributable to strengthen the C&I class due to a new crude manufacturing customers in energy sector growth. ","Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased six-tenths of a percent driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and usage increases in the small C&I class. ","Economic conditions remain strong across Xcel Energy service territories relative to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our region of 3.6% remains well below the national average of 5.4%. In addition, the number of jobs in our regions grew 2.3% during 2014 compared with 1.9% for the nation. ","Focusing more specifically on 2014 earnings, ongoing electric margin increased 215 million. Key drivers included implementation of final and interim rates which increased margin by 129 million, non-fuel riders increased margin by 57 million, increased transmission investment which improved margin by 31 million and retail sales growth excluding weather improved margins by 24 million. ","These positive impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of 60 million as well as a few other items. The electric margin results reflect an estimated recent obligation for the Minnesota rate case which is relatively consistent with the recent ALJ recommendation and an estimated customer refund liability to capture the impact of our electric earnings test at PSCo. ","Margins on the natural gas side of the business increased by 49 million for the year; this is primarily due to rate release in Colorado, significant infrastructure investment that is captured in an annual rider and retail sales growth. ","O&M expenses increased 61 million or 2.7% for 2014, solidly within our original guidance of 2% to 3% increase. The increase is primarily driven by higher although moderating nuclear cost. As we have discussed in the past the key objective of our operational excellence strategic pillar is to limit O&M increases. We are reaffirming our 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2% consistent with our long-term objective. In addition I think it's worth mentioning that our 2015 O&M guidance assumption reflects a lower pension discount rate and adoption of the recently updated mortality table. ","Finally other taxes increased about 45 million or 11%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota, Texas and Colorado.","Next I will update you on several regulatory proceedings; additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado we are pleased to have reached a settlement with Hardy\u2019s that would successfully resolve our electric rate case. The agreement continues to the productive multiyear regulatory contract that we have been operating under since 2012. The settlement cost for the total increase up about 53 million or 1.9% based on an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition we anticipate the PSCo will differ about 3 million of expenses in 2015. ","The agreement also stipulates that both the Clean Air Clean Jobs and transmission riders are forward looking mechanisms. It is worth noting than in our original Colorado rate case we had proposed shortening the depreciable lives of certain assets, which would have led to a material increase in depreciation expense. As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not be implementing the depreciation changes and will avoid this incremental depreciation expense, alternatively we agreed to file a standalone depreciation study early next year that will be incorporated into our next rate case anticipated in 2018. ","The connection is expected to rule on the settlement in the first quarter and rates are expected to become effective in mid-February. Last month we received an ALJ recommendation in our Minnesota electric case. We were encouraged by that the judge acknowledged the strength of the company\u2019s position on many of the key issues including pension, benefits and depreciation. Including the ALJ's recommended ROE of 9.77% and adjusting for sales and property tax trip we estimate a cumulative revenue increase of about 192 million for 2014 and 2015. Deliberations are currently scheduled from March. ","Turning to our Monticello prudence review, we have not yet received ALJ recommendation we believe the delay is related to workload issues for the ALJ and anticipate the ALF recommendation in February. We continue to believe that we acted prudently in making decisions throughout the course of the project, in addition to the surrounding communities and customers have a largely rebuild safe and efficient source of carbon free low cost power for many years to come. Importantly we don\u2019t believe that the delay in receiving the ALJ\u2019s recommendation will impact the current schedule and we continue to expect the commission to deliberate on the proceeding in March. In Texas we filed the rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of 65 million or 6.7%. Our filing reflects the inclusion of posttest year rate base additions. One of the items we are seeking legislative support for in Texas. New rates are expected to be implemented by midyear. In South Dakota we put interim rates of our 16 million in place on January 01st and continue to walkthrough the regulatory process. Final rates are expected to be approved midyear. ","We also made progress on several other initiatives during the fourth quarter. In Wisconsin, the commission approved the settlement agreement which we reached last year with staff and intervenors for rate increase of 14 million or 2.2%. Rates went into effect earlier this month. In Texas the commission approved our settlement in the 2014 rate case providing incremental revenue of 37 million or 3.5%. Rates went into effect retroactive to June 2014. ","Finally in Minnesota the commission approved our gas infrastructure rider for 15 million with rates becoming effective in February 2015. ","In summary 2014 was a busy and productive year for us on the regulatory front. This morning we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed due primarily to incorporating actual 2014 results.","With that I\u2019ll wrap up my comments. After a solid 2014 we are pleased to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, our five year capital plan of $14.5 billion and our 4.7% rate based CAGR even when considering the impacts from the recently passed depreciation legislation. We continue to see improved economic conditions in our regions and experienced better than expected sales growth with 2014 weather adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.3% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.6%.","We are making meaningful progress on the regulatory front, including the recent multi-year settlement in Colorado, and expect to reach a conclusion in the Minnesota\u2019s case in the next few months. We delivered 2014 O&M expense growth within our guidance of 2% to 3% and continue to expect 2014 O&M expense to be flat to 2%. And finally we are well positioned to deliver an attractive long term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually.","So with that operator we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question today from Michael Weinstein, UBS.","Michael Weinstein","Perhaps first if you can, you talked a lot about the future here, you talked about the IRP can you perhaps comment on the ability for itself to take advantage of opportunities perhaps in solar in the near term and perhaps in the long term. And perhaps also at the same time elaborate -- you introduced the comment other products and services perhaps could you elaborate a little bit on what you meant there as well.","Ben Fowke","Sure. And we\u2019re going to add obviously as part of that the resource plan a tremendous amount of renewables both wind and solar. A lot of it comes in the \u201920 through \u201930 time frame. I think that gives us a great opportunity to own a good piece of those investment opportunities for couple of reasons. One, clearly technology will come down and it will most likely not have as much of the federal tax incentives that it does have now. Two, our tax appetite should grow in the coming year. So, I think we should be well positioned to take advantage of some of those opportunities. Your second question was regarding\u2026","Michael Weinstein","I suppose you\u2019ve made this, curious comment about offering other products and services. I am just curious if there was anything tangible?","Ben Fowke","I mean there is a number of things that we want to do. I mean increasingly customer want different energy mix. They want greener products. They want different billing options. It\u2019s basically just responding to the trend that we\u2019ve seen that consumers, one size that\u2019s all which has been the traditional utility role need to change. And we want to work with our commission and their staffs to make sure that we do that in a way that\u2019s fair to all and be flexible enough to move forward with that.","Michael Weinstein","Excellent and just if you don't mind commenting on transmission here, I would be curious, where does your transco strategy stand given some commentary from peers and the SPP market overall of perhaps a lackluster spend trajectory here at least for 2015? How does that jive with what you are baking into expectations and your own expectations for longer-term build out of the transco? And perhaps the clarification on the last question, does that mean for solar it's an opportunity for you all post the 2016 ITC? Is that what I'm hearing from you?","Ben Fowke","It means that it would be -- the opportunity improved significantly doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do something before that. But as you know renewables are heavily driven by tax appetites and you need one to efficiently doesn\u2019t mean you are fully precluded but to efficiently participate in those markets. Your question was about transcos and transmission. Well keep in mind that $4.5 billion of our CapEx over the next five years is in transmission, none of it is in a transco and none of it assumes that we win any of the competitive transmission projects.","So when you looked at what\u2019s come out of SSP and their ITP 10 plan I think it was about 300-odd million dollars of potential opportunities, by the way it looks like not an incident to get amount on that would go into the SPS. But we don\u2019t have to -- that does not impact, that would be the icing on the cake. So, our strategy has always been two pronged. We have the utility vehicle to invest in, that\u2019s where we are today. We\u2019re in the process of getting approvals, final approvals on our transco so that we can participate in those competitive markets. I think we\u2019re well positioned to do that. It\u2019s gone a little bit slower as you mentioned than I think many people thought. It doesn\u2019t really surprise us. I think there will be more opportunities in the years to come. And again I think we\u2019ll be very well positioned to win in those markets.","Michael Weinstein","But to summarize, you feel confident in the 4.5 billion you have already delineated in executing on that despite perhaps a little bit of the lack-lusterness in SPP, et cetera?","Ben Fowke","Those by and large are identified projects so yes we feel very confident in that.","Operator","Ali Agha with SunTrust is next.","Ali Agha","Can you remind me, in your '15 guidance range right now, what kind of regulatory lag is assumed there? And best case scenario, how much of that do you think you can ultimately capture?","Teresa Madden","I mean just historically we've been writing about 100 basis points in terms of regulatory lag. And as we talked about is one of our properties is we intend to close that gap at 50 basis points. That's our target. Now if that's not evenly spread over the next year so we do intend to start to put that in place in 2015, so we are looking towards some improvements in that. It will -- the trajectory is again no ratable, but we'll move up. So it's smaller in the first year.","Ali Agha","But to be clear, you said the starting point in '15 -- I think the 2 to 2015 guidance, that is still assuming at the midpoint about 100 basis point lag?","Teresa Madden","Yes it's a little -- it's right around there. We've assumed it's a slight piece.","Ali Agha","Then my second question. As you mentioned, you ran -- weather normalized electric sales were up 1.3% in '14 ahead of perhaps your origin plan, but I noticed that for '15 you are still assuming 1% and I think for gas you're actually assuming a 2% decline, so why the slowdown in electric or what are you seeing in '15 that causes you to be more cautious?","Teresa Madden","We're just being conservative in terms of our overall outlook in terms of 2015. As we've talked to you and this goes for gas too in previous quarters, early in the year we had some extreme weather and we were always concerned. We had a little bit weather wrapped up in our overall sales, so both in the electric and gas business, so we're just being conservative Ali and saying that it's not any significant item that's driving us to keep it at that level the 1%.","Ali Agha","And then I wanted to be clear you know the comments you made that in your next Colorado gas case, you do plan to also ask to put some of your gas reserves into rate base. Can you remind us if that happens, what kind of increment rate base does that mean? And also, what is the mechanism? I was unclear, is it part of the rate case? Is it a separate filing? Just want to be clear on how this goes.","Ben Fowke","Yes I don\u2019t know if we're actually going to talk very much about it in the actual case that we'll file to get recovery of core infrastructure investments, Ali. What I said is that we would do a concurrent filing, a separate filing that will take place most likely in the second half of this year. We're going to gather stakeholder input, understand what the important issues with our stakeholders are. Assuming those conversations and the filing goes well and I assume there'll be kind of open type meetings, then look for us to pursue a defined and more flushed out plan obviously in the 2016 timeframe. We purchased about 450 Bcf a year, so what is that, $3 that's about $1.2 billion of gas. Obviously we wouldn\u2019t do it all, so you'd have -- you would lay into it slowly. I think with the emphasis more on our LDC business -- gas business in Colorado.","Ali Agha","Okay, but just the mechanism I mean, if it moves into rate base, you would want rate increases to reflect that. So would that be sort of put in as part of this rate case filing? Would that be a separate rate case? How would the rates be adjusted if you do get it into rate base?","Ben Fowke","It would be separate and it -- the whole premise is it's fuel for rate base and so how that mechanism would be determined there's different models out there as I think you're aware and we would -- that's the kind of input we want from stakeholders to understand what risk they're willing to bear and which risk they're not willing to bear and then we can move forward accordingly.","Ali Agha","And final question. In the past, Ben you\u2019ve also talked about looking at opportunities where you have current BPAs and that may be expiring. Is that an opportunity to rate base some of those plants? As we look at calendar 2015, just looking at where you are in terms of contracts, et cetera, are there opportunities that could play out this year, or is this something that we should think about beyond 2015?","Ben Fowke","I mean I think there's always opportunities I mean -- and we're always looking for those opportunities to your point and so I can't promise anything, but we certainly are diligently looking at those opportunities.","Ali Agha","It could happen this year if something comes together?","Ben Fowke","It could.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","First question is on the Colorado rate case. How much of a depreciation increase had you initially asked for that was subsequently removed in the context of the settlement?","Teresa Madden","Greg it was north of $30 million so.","Greg Gordon","Second question is on cap spending. And I'm referring to the slides you brought to my conference a couple weeks ago. They were pretty consistent, I think, with prior disclosures. You have a $3.375 billion spend in 2015. Declines to more or less $2.8 billion in \u201916, \u201917, then dips a little bit in \u201918, comes back up in \u201919. So that averages 4.7 but it's front-end loaded. And then you have made these subsequent filings in Minnesota, specifically on resource planning. So is the bias to potentially see if you get by in Minnesota to see that \u201917, \u201918, \u201919 spend potentially go up?","Teresa Madden","Well, maybe I will just add there in terms of the spend, why we have that peak just as a reminder Greg it\u2019s the wind in Minnesota the two wind farms that will go in service. And so that is really the peak up. And then in terms of relative to going forward, that once rates would change, assuming they do, we should level off in terms of our relative increases. So we do have the initial peak. ","Greg Gordon","Right. I guess I am asking -- I know you are working; you have a rate plan to smooth in those increases. My question goes more towards the overall level of cap spending which declines as you get out into \u201917, \u201918, \u201919?","Ben Fowke","Typically Greg and there are obviously no guarantee but as you know -- as we get into those out years the actual spend has historically tended to increase as we identify new opportunities or new needs within our spending parameters. And I think you also were asking about the resource plan itself that we found, and as I said I think that could create some opportunities for us albeit most of them would be in the later part of that five year forecast or even outside of that five year forecast.","Greg Gordon","Got you. So when we think about your 5% to 7% growth aspiration, this plan drives slightly less in terms of rate-based growth, and then improving regulatory lag to inside the range. But should you, in fact, identify more cap spending than that whole sort of calculus just moves up a bit.","Teresa Madden","We've tempered back the 5 to 7 to be closer to around 5% rate base growth as we look forward, so it\u2019s a little bit lower than the 5 to 7 in past years I talked about. ","Ben Fowke","So we always look for rate based opportunities Greg, to your point and also to your point the thing that will really drive earnings is closing that ROE gap, as Teresa mentioned. I think we are making good progress on that, and we're excited about continuing what has been a good deal for customers and shareholders in Colorado and I am encouraged with the progress we are making here in Minnesota. ","Greg Gordon","Great. And then the final question is last year you raised the dividend first quarter, whereas in prior years you had raised it later in the year. What is your expectation of the current dividend cycle to this year and going forward? ","Ben Fowke","Yes, we addressed that with the Board and so that you probably can assume that last year\u2019s cycle will be more consistent going forward. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller ","Hi. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the impact on you guys from the oil price drop and how that might be incorporated or not in that 1% demand forecast, anything around that that would have a material impact?","Ben Fowke","I guess, let me start and I will let Teresa add if she thinks I have missed anything. One as Teresa we have got a 1% is probably all things equal fairly conservative sales forecast. So we have margin, reserve margin, if you will, but actually we don\u2019t really see much in the way of we do sales coming out of the decline in oil prices, and to the extent we do keep in mind that, that is probably the lowest margin part of our business. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big impact Travis, really don\u2019t and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big impact on our capital expanding profile either. ","Travis Miller ","Okay. Great. And then one on the Colorado case, on the electric side. How much given though the adjustments you were able to get out of the Clean Air Clean Jobs, and the transmission into riders and such, how much now, give us a sense on a percentage basis or idea, is subject to demand? Demand sensitive in terms of earning ROE?","Teresa Madden","In terms of just a sales growth?","Travis Miller ","Yes, needing sales growth to compensate for the net capital investment that you guys would see over this three-year period.","Teresa Madden","I think it\u2019s very moderate in terms of that, because those were our biggest drivers in terms of that cost recovery and having those mechanisms in place. We are definitely predicting sales growth but it\u2019s not dependent in terms of earning our ROE on having an aggressive sales growth achievement. ","Ben Fowke","I would agree with that what Teresa said, I mean, of course the riders help with the incremental but I mean you got your core business, so sales growth is always an issue. But I think we have that reasonably paid and to Teresa\u2019s point we are not assuming an aggressive sales forecast in those numbers. ","Operator","Next is Chris Turnure, JPMorgan.","Chris Turnure","Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the e21 initiative. You mentioned that you came out with the initial blueprint back in December and then you actually filed with the MPEC this month for a specific rider mechanism of some kind. You were a little bit high level with the description there. I wanted to find out a little bit more in the way of detail and find out more in the way of timing. And then also I wanted to understand the interplay between that request and then the fact that you have kind of bundled in some futuristic carbon goals as well. How do those two relate within that request?","Ben Fowke","I guess to try to answer that it\u2019s all about having a longer term approach to what we're trying to accomplish in Minnesota. So, the resource plan we went out further here is what we can do by 2030 here is how we get there. Let\u2019s focus on the key objective which is carbon reduction, must be very disciplined about how we achieve that carbon reduction using what we like to call technologies at the speed of value. So disciplined on how we approach it.","And let\u2019s make sure that our regulatory compact reflects that longer view. So yes we outlined general frameworks but generally what we\u2019re looking for is longer term regulatory compacts. We like to see compacts three, four maybe even out to five years long. And within that things you can augment that with writers, you could use formulaic recovery type mechanisms and then have the incentives for achieving what I think the state wants us to achieve. So we less deliberately beg but we\u2019re building off that e21 initiative which we participated in but we didn\u2019t drive.","So I really think there is an excitement here in Minnesota as we\u2019ve outlined these plans and talked about how we can achieve these carbon reduction goals at a very-very modest price to consumers. So more to come on that but I think it\u2019s a pretty exciting time.","Teresa Madden","Maybe just to add to that I mean and just to clarify Ben outlined the framework but I think you mentioned that we had made a rider request, we haven\u2019t specifically done that, so just to add to Ben\u2019s comment in terms of the overall framework.","Chris Turnure","Okay. Got you. So nothing specific with a rider request and then just stepping back, overall this is more driven by future growth, future spending, demands and initiatives, and then those are going to potentially necessitate some kind of rider or catch-up mechanism to compensate you for that?","Ben Fowke","There is different ways you can get there. So the point is that we\u2019re moving to a different environment and we\u2019re going to need the regulatory compact to evolve with it. And so the key takeaway I hope we it is that what we\u2019re really seeking is a more comprehensive multiyear approach.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And then do you guys have any color around initial conversations there with regulators and then, separately, in either Minnesota or in Texas, initial conversations with policy makers and the timing around your legislative initiatives in both those states?","Ben Fowke","Well, let me just say that, I\u2019ve had opportunity as have others on the Xcel team to talk about what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. And as I mentioned I think there is a lot of excitement and I think there is -- the devil is always in the details as you know. But I think there is a lot of excitement that this is a way we ought to be going as a state. So that\u2019s from a regulatory perspective. We like to potentially have legislation that would support that new regulatory framework in Minnesota. So, more to come on that obviously. ","In Texas I think we\u2019re getting some traction it\u2019s still little bit early days they haven\u2019t even assigned - made committee assignments to the key committees that would drive legislation for us. But we haven\u2019t seen any major road blocks at this point.","Operator","At this time, we\u2019ll take the question from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Quick one, you mentioned exploring ways to avoid a 2016 Minnesota rate case. Could you elaborate?","Ben Fowke","Let me take a stab at it. I mean first of all where there is a will there is a way. And I think as I\u2019ve said there is really a will to let\u2019s get to 2016 case out of the way and let\u2019s focus on this longer term framework. So how we do that mechanically? Well, it starts with using the ALJ recommendations, getting our interim rate proposal adopted close to what we\u2019ve proposed and then taking a look at our excess depreciation and maybe reshaping that a bit along with using some of our nuclear depreciation as well. So, there is a way Jonathan and it would be nice to free up the time so we could spend time on these other more longer term ideas that the community and we have.","Jonathan Arnold","It sounds like you might be reasonably well along with having getting that done? Is that fair?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think the first step in getting it done was a constructive ALJ settlement. So we've got something to work with now and then again if parties want to do it, I think we've got the pathway forward.","Jonathan Arnold","And then still another topic, the gas rate basing subject. How -- given the change in the commodity price, obviously it would seem interesting for some of your stakeholders to lock that in. How confident are you that you will be able to find the other side of the deal?","Ben Fowke","There's definitely an economic benefit to moving forward especially where gas prices are today, but we have to make sure that -- there'll be a lot of concerns. I mean this won't be an easy lift. But I think the economics are compelling enough that I would -- that I have optimism that ultimately we can get something done, but it's going to take time Jon.","Jonathan Arnold","My question was a bit more to the appetite -- you see appetite from producers to lock in these prices?","Ben Fowke","Well I mean that's -- yes, I think you can find the producers, that's not going to be an issue.","Jonathan Arnold","You're more focused on your side?","Ben Fowke","Yes, right.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next we hear from Ashar Khan, Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Teresa can you -- you mentioned the bonus appreciation, what is the cash flow impact?","Teresa Madden","Well the bonus appreciation I mean for basically the extension and.","Ashar Khan","Yes.","Teresa Madden","It's a combination, it's about 1.8 billion and it's [indiscernible] between the two years about 1.4 billion in '14 and about 400 million in '15 because we have some carry over.","Ashar Khan","So that's extra cash you'll get.","Teresa Madden","Well that's the bonus depreciation amount so that's a tax impact on that so.","Ashar Khan","So I can take that number and do a tax impact on that.","Teresa Madden","Yes.","Ashar Khan","And so is that now factored in into your -- I guess how does that help? Does that lower debt needs or how is that cash being used in the process?","Teresa Madden","Well we've factored into our overall guidance in terms of the effects of the bonus depreciation so we've taken that all into account. To the extent we have that, we also have some rate base offsets, so it's a combination, but we've factored that all into our 2015 guidance and our updates.","Ben Fowke","One thing you'll note Ashar is that we have reduced our debt plan debt issuance over the five year time period. The other thing is obviously some [indiscernible] depreciation comes in NOL and push forward because you can only utilize so much of it per year. So it's had a modest improvement in our cash flow needs or our financing needs.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. And at this time I will turn the conference over to Teresa Madden for any closing or additional remarks.","Teresa Madden","Well thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning and please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow up questions. Thanks again.","Ben Fowke ","Thank you everyone.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"23029":["Xcel Energy Inc.

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be provided at that time. (Operator Instructions)","I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today Thursday October 25, 2012 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Management. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Johnson","Thank you. And welcome to Xcel Energy\u2019s 2012 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller.","This morning we will provide with you an update on third quarter results and recent business developments, update you on our 2012 guidance and introduce our new five-year capital forecast, financing plan and 2013 earnings guidance.","There are slides that accompany today\u2019s conference call available on our webpage. In addition, we will post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on the website.","As a reminder, some of the comments during this morning\u2019s conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","Today\u2019s press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2012 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.81 per share reflect a $0.03 per share positive impact of a restoration of a tax benefit previously expensed in 2012 associated with federal subsidies for prescription drug plans. This benefit is not included in ongoing earnings, which is consistent with our treatment in 2010.","Management believes ongoing earnings which remove the impact of non-recurring items provide a more meaningful comparison. As a result, comments this morning will focus on going earnings.","With that, I will now turn the call over the Ben Fowke.","Ben Fowke","Well, thanks Paul, and good morning. I\u2019m very pleased to report that 2012 third quarter ongoing earnings increased 13% to $0.78 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in 2011. As you know, we made -- make it a priority to invest in our system with projects that provide long-term value to our customers.","We achieve constructive and timely recovery of such investments in several jurisdictions, which contributed to this quarter\u2019s performance. In addition, O&M expenses decreased slightly for the quarter reflecting our continued cost control measures.","Finally, warmer than normal weather increased third quarter earnings by just over $0.07 per share, since we also experienced a hot summer last year this summer\u2019s weather didn\u2019t create a variance when making the quarterly comparison.","Our third quarter earnings are in contrast with the rather slow start we had to the year, marked by warm winter weather, lower sales and a couple of disappointing regulatory decisions.","Recall that we responded immediately by implementing cost control measures to partially offset these negative factors, an indicative we expected to deliver earnings within the lower half of our guidance range.","With continued careful cost management and the improvement in weather during the summer, we now expect to deliver 2012 ongoing earnings within our earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share.","Our 2012 GAAP earnings are expected to be in the upper half of the guidance range as a result of the $0.03 per share tax benefit that, Paul, just discussed.","Teresa will discuss our quarterly earnings in greater detail in a few moments. I\u2019ll now comment on a few recent developments starting with the introduction of our updated five-year capital forecast, which you will find in our earnings release.","We anticipate spending approximately $13.2 billion over the next -- over the five-year timeframe of 2013 to 2017. This is slightly less than our previous forecast.","Additionally, we have reduced our projected equity needs by $350 million. The reduction in future equity needs is primarily driven by lower capital investment, the timing of those investments and improved cash flows.","Let me highlight some of the changes to the updated capital forecast. Our previous capital forecast included $470 million of investment to meet CSAPR requirements in Texas. We have removed the SPS environmental projects from our forecast following the court\u2019s decision to vacate CSAPR.","The court stated that the EPA must continue administering care pending adoption of a valid replacement. At SPS, we plan to comply with care through modest allowance purchases beginning in 2015.","Longer term, it\u2019s possible that future regulations could require the addition of FCRs and scrubbers at our SPS coal facilities. However, because of the uncertainty of any additional regulations, including timing, these potential investments are expected to be beyond the current five-year forecast.","Our updated capital forecast also reflects increased infrastructure investment, particularly related to natural gas pipeline integrity and electric distribution projects. Most of the larger projects, such as CapX2020, the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act and the nuclear upgrade and life extension remain significant components of the five-year plan. I do want to point out that this forecast includes the Prairie Island upgrade project which represents about $200 million of CapX spend primarily in 2016 and 2017.","Earlier this year, we filed a Change of Circumstance with the Minnesota Commission, because the benefits of this project had narrowed since it was originally proposed. While under review circumstances have continued to evolve and now indicate that the benefits of the upgrade are less than we anticipated in our March filing.","At this point, we conclude that further investment in the project will not benefit our customers. The project is being reviewed by the commission, as well as other parties and we expect a determination sometime in 2013.","Return in operations, we continue to make great progress on our CapX2020 transmission project. The first four projects representing approximately 700 miles and $1 billion of capital investment for Xcel Energy have all received state regulatory approval and are now in construction phase.","Approximately one half of this project\u2019s planned investment will be made in 2012 and 2013. In September, the second segment of the Bemidji-Grand Rapids transmission line was completed and energized, entire 70-mile line is now in service.","Overall, the CapX2020 transmission project remains on time and on budget, demonstrating our continued ability to manage complicated projects and deliver value to all our stakeholders.","Looking ahead, 2013 will be an active year for us, as we plan to file several rate cases this fall. In early November, we\u2019ll file a Minnesota Electric Rate Case, which will reflect significant capital investment going into service associated with nuclear and other infrastructure projects, as well as the decline in electric sales that we\u2019d experienced in Minnesota. Teresa will speak to the drivers of that request in a few moments.","We also plan to make filings for Colorado gas and electric filings in Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota before the end of the year. All of which are in addition to open dockets in South Dakota and Wisconsin. So 2013 will be a busy regulatory year for us.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today I will discuss third quarter results, provide an update on our regulatory proceedings, review our 2012 financing plan and update you on our 2012 and 2013 earnings guidance.","Let\u2019s begin by reviewing our third quarter results at each of our four operating companies. Third quarter earnings at PSCo increased $0.07 per share, primarily due to an electric rate increase implemented in May associated with the approved multi-year plan. Quarterly results also benefited from lower O&M expenses and warmer summer weather. For 2012 we are on track to earn close to our authorized ROE of 10% in Colorado.","Earnings at NSP-Minnesota declined $0.01 per share for the quarter. In addition, NSP-Minnesota earnings were down on a year-to-date basis driven by sluggish sales, increased property taxes, higher O&M expense and unfavorable weather. In 2012, we expect to earn well below our authorized ROE. Clearly, this highlights the need to file our 2013 electric rate case in Minnesota.","SPS earnings increased $0.02 per share for the quarter. New rate increases in New Mexico and Texas implemented in January were partially offset by the impact of milder weather, higher depreciation experience and property taxes. We currently project SPS to earn in the mid 9% range in 2012.","Finally, third quarter earnings at NSP-Wisconsin were flat. In 2012, we expect NSP-Wisconsin to earn in the upper 9% ROE range.","On a consolidated basis, we continue to project our 2012 ROE will be greater than 10%. I will now discuss some of the key drivers that affected the income statement beginning with retail electric margin.","Third quarter electric margin increased $57 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were $46 million from new rate increases in several states including Colorado, $13 million from increased conservation and DSM expenses, and $11 million from higher transmission revenue. These positive items were partially offset by lower firm wholesale revenues due to the expiration of a long-term agreement with Black Hills Corporation in January 2012.","We continue to experience sluggish sales trend. On a year-to-date and weather normalized basis, electric sales were flat. However, if you adjust for the additional day of sales due to leap year, electric sales got actually declined three tenths of a percent. Part of this decline is due to the loss of one of our largest customers in Minnesota.","In May, the Verso Paper Mill in Sartell, Minnesota experienced a fire. The company subsequently decided not to reopen the facility. In 2011, this paper mill represented approximately 1.4% of total retail electric sales at NSP-Minnesota and six tenth of a percent of Xcel Energy\u2019s retail electric sales. On a consolidated basis, we continue to forecast flat sales levels for 2012.","Turning to expenses, we continue to successfully manage O&M in an effort to match our spending with the negligible sales growth we\u2019ve experienced to date as well as other headwinds we\u2019ve faced in 2012. As a result of the cost management initiatives that we began implementing in January, our O&M expenses were essentially flat for both the third quarter and the year-to-date period. However, we don\u2019t expect to maintain the flat O&M trend for the remainder of the year.","After experiencing a hot summer, we plan to put some money into our system to ensure that we continue to maintain high levels of reliability. Also, after corresponding merit increases earlier this year, we reinstated them in October.","As a result, we now expect 2012 O&M expense to increase by approximately 2% for the year. Other taxes increased approximately $11.6 million or about 13% largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. As a reminder, our request for deferred accounting treatment was denied by the Minnesota Commission earlier this year.","Higher property taxes incurred in Colorado related to the electric retail business are being deferred as part of the multiyear rate settlement approved by the Colorado commission in May. I will now provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. We currently have three notable regulatory proceedings underway. We filed for rate relief in South Dakota and Wisconsin.","Late last week, the Wisconsin staff filed their recommendation which we viewed as constructive. In Colorado, we are seeking recovery of the full amount of our smart grid city investment. Details of these cases are provided in our earnings release.","We anticipate resolution of each of these cases later this year. In addition, we continue to make preparations to file several cases before year end, including electric cases in Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas as well as the gas case in Colorado.","We\u2019ll be able to discuss these cases in more detail at our year-end conference call in January. In Minnesota, we plan to fill an electric rate case next week. Until the case is filed, there are limited details that we can share with you.","Our plan is to file a one-year 2013 test year rate case with interim rates expected to be effective in January 2013. Primary drivers of the case are the continued high level of investment to keep our system safe and reliable over the long-term such as our investments extend the lives of our nuclear plant and obtain more power from the Monticello nuclear facility.","Recovery of these investments as well as other general business cost increases would be at the level you would expect given our CapEx progress. This case will also address the increases in property tax that we have experienced which we forecast to be even higher in 2013.","In addition, we will reset rates using current projected sales levels which are lower than what we used in our most recent rate case driven primarily by the economy and the loss of some large customers. We also plan to include proposals for how we can help support economic growth to help mitigate the sales effects over time.","We are looking forward to working constructively with stakeholders and customers as we file and move through the case. We plan to file the one-year rate case we remain interested in working with the parties to arrive at a framework that can address 2014 and beyond to better manage the financial impact of substantial capital investment in an environment with flat or declining electric sales.","The Minnesota Commission has opened the proceeding on a multiyear rate plan. Assuming that process results in a constructive framework, we would expect to submit a plan during 2013 or 2014 and beyond. We will continue to participate in this ongoing docket which will serve to help shape its filing.","Now, I would like to update you on the completion of our 2012 financing plan. We\u2019re pleased to have the opportunity to take advantage of historically low interest rates, issuing a total of $1.8 billion of first mortgage bonds in 2012.","During the third quarter and into early October, we issued $800 million of first mortgage bonds at both NSP-Minnesota, and PSCo, as well as $100 million at first mortgage bond at NSP-Wisconsin. As a result of these transactions, we dramatically lowered our cost of debt and extended maturities. This was particularly true at NSP-Minnesota and PSCo where we refinanced over $1.2 billion in bonds that had interest rates of about 8%.","Notably, the NSP-Minnesota $300 million 10-year tranche priced at 2.15% coupons, and the $500 million 30-year tranche priced at 3.4% coupon. Both of these represented record low utility coupons for their respective tenor.","The PSCo bonds were issued at slightly higher rates but still among the lowest for the utility sector. These bonds will provide low-cost capital for our customer for years to come.","One additional financing related item, Moody\u2019s recently downgraded SPS by one notch based on the expected moderation of SPS\u2019s credit metrics due to high levels of capital expenditures and regulatory lag. The outlook is now stable.","Considering the significant planned investment in the SPS system over the next five years, strong credit metrics and timely recovery of costs are critical. Clearly, we\u2019ll continue to work with our stakeholders, including state regulatory commissioners and staff, the Office of the Attorney General, key large customers, consumer advocates, state government officials and others to reinforce the importance of timely recovery associated with these investments, as this is a critical factor in our decision-making process.","Turning to our earnings guidance, we expect 2012 ongoing earnings guidance to be within the $1.75 to $1.85 range. However, GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the upper half of the range due to the tax benefit previously discussed.","In a year, where we\u2019ve faced stiff headwinds early, we take great pride in our efforts to position the company to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the eighth year in a row. Looking ahead, we\u2019re initiating our 2013 earnings guidance of $1.85 to $1.95.","Based on the midpoint of our guidance range for both 2012 and 2013, this would represent 6% earnings growth, consistent with our 5% to 7% target. The key assumptions for 2013 are outlined in today\u2019s press release.","I\u2019ll now share with you some details behind a few of the assumptions. We assume constructive outcomes in all rate case proceedings. We forecast consolidated weather-adjusted electric utility sales growth of 0.5%. However, the forecast does vary by operating company.","We anticipate sales growth of approximately 1% at PSCo, sales declines of approximately 1% at NSP-Minnesota, sales growth of approximately 3% at SPS, and flat sales at NSP-Wisconsin. For natural gas, we are projecting a weather-adjusted firm sales decline of 1%.","O&M expenses are forecasted to increase 4 to 5%. The primary drivers include rising pensions, medical and nuclear costs in addition to our continued capital investment in our system.","Depreciation is expected to increase $70 million to $80 million, also driven by continued capital investment in our system. Property taxes are expected to increase $35 million.","As a result of recent refinancing to take advantage of the low coupon debt, we expect interest expense to decline by $30 million to $35 million. And, finally, our 2013 EPS guidance is based on a range of 490 million to 500 million common share equivalent.","In closing, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter, well positioning the company to meet our earnings objectives for the eighth consecutive year. Looking ahead, our guidance range for 2013 is consistent with our plan to grow earnings 5% to 7% annually.","Before I turn the call over to you for questions, I\u2019d like to comment on our plans for our annual analyst meeting. Over the last several months, we\u2019ve spoken with many of you regarding the frequency with which we host our analyst meetings.","The feedback we\u2019ve received clearly indicated that holding the meeting every other year or as needed was sufficient. As a result, we won\u2019t be hosting an Analyst Meeting this December. However, we currently intend to host one in December of 2013.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar Securities Research. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research","Good morning, thanks.","Ben Fowke","Good morning, Travis.","Teresa Madden","Good Morning.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research","You guys mentioned in the release, the cost savings initiatives that helped keep that O&M flat. And as you\u2019ve suggested a pretty modest 2% for the full year, can you detail what some of those have been this year and how sustainable, I guess those are?","Teresa Madden","Well, we started the year in terms of an overall looking across the board in terms of where we could eliminate what we would called discretionary items, and so that could be some consulting costs. We eliminated our wage increase, which we have reinstated. But generally they were just across the board, where we looked for opportunities to lower our overall costs.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research","Okay. And you expect those to be, other than the wage increase, obviously, you expect some of those to be sustainable?","Teresa Madden","Yeah. We do.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kit Konolige from BGC. Please go ahead.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Good morning.","Ben Fowke","Good morning, Kit.","Teresa Madden","Good morning.","Kit Konolige - BGC","So just to follow a little on your discussion of the five-year CapEx outlook and your equity plans, I think you mentioned, Teresa, the driver of the lowered equity needs was partly less CapEx, partly higher cash from operations, if you can go into a little detail on those points?","Teresa Madden","Well, Kit, the CapEx, if we look at the five-year period, even though it\u2019s slightly different, in terms of 12 to 16 or 13 to 17 it\u2019s still just over a $13 billion. But two important things, in terms of removing CSAPR, we had a higher front end. We\u2019ve added some infrastructure costs in PSCo, in terms of the gas replacement program.","The removing of the CSAPR project had some regulatory lag with it and whereas, if we are assuming relative to the gas infrastructure, we do have a rider in place, or through this rate based recovery that will help us work towards having a lower equity requirement.","Kit Konolige - BGC","And is that, that\u2019s the primary driver of the delta in your expected equity needs?","Teresa Madden","It really is, yeah, because over the period, the spend is pretty much the same in terms of just over $13 billion.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Great. Can you discuss the timing of the equity issuance at all?","Teresa Madden","Well, we don\u2019t need equity in 2012. We believe in 2013 or 2014, we could have the need for equity, but it\u2019s going to depend on a lot of things that we consider. Overall market decisions, the ultimate timing of spend, credit metrics, we\u2019ll take that all into consideration.","Ben Fowke","I think the good news, Kit, is we\u2019re going need a lot less equity and that gives us a lot more flexibility going forward.","Kit Konolige - BGC","I agree, that sounds like good news and can you maybe touch on the dividend a little bit in that context as well. I think in the past, the discussion has been along the lines that dividend growth would be less than EPS growth for a number of years, while the large CapEx budget was in place as that declines. Maybe that relationship between dividend and EPS growth changes some. Should we be thinking any differently about that at this point?","Ben Fowke","No. I think what we said before and how we reward investors between the dividend and EPS growth still holds true, Kit. I mean, we still have a lot of rate based growth obviously in the next couple of years.","And just like our equity needs, we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility and what we can do with the dividend. I mean, we\u2019ve got, I think, a pretty modest payout ratio compared to our peers. So it\u2019s an arrow in the proverbial quiver, if you will.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Thank you. Good morning.","Ben Fowke","Hey, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Hey, Ben. Ben or Teresa, the $13.2 billion of CapEx spend budget for \u201813 through \u201817, could you then remind us what kind of annual rate-based growth does that support say \u201812 over \u201813 and \u201817 over that five-year period?","Ben Fowke","I think we\u2019re still growing in that 6% to 7% clip, Ali.","Dave Sparby","At least through 2014, Ali. Post that it will start to come down as CapEx comes down.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. Okay. But and I don\u2019t have a chance to look at the numbers themselves. So I mean, if I do it over a five-year period, 5% to 6% that would be reasonable?","Ben Fowke","Yeah. I think that\u2019s probably right.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. And then on the equity issue question, so the share count increase that you guys are assuming for \u201813 in your guidance right now. Obviously that the range there, so right now is that assuming drip, or I\u2019m assuming, I guess, the higher end of that would include equity issuance as well. Can you give us a little better handle on that check on range for \u201813 and how you\u2019re thinking about equity in there?","Teresa Madden","Well, we\u2019re still assuming that we would have our drip and benefit programs in place at the same level, which has been around $80 million a year. And then we put the range in to provide for some flexibility as I was just indicating.","But it could be 2013, it could be 2014. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll just consider all the circumstances and it could be either of the years. And that\u2019s why we indicated a range this year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","I see. And final question, you laid out also your load forecast obviously for full year this year and for next year. Can you remind us the earnings sensitivities? We should think about 1% move in load, what that means for EPS for you guys?","Teresa Madden","Generally, 1% load can range from margins at $20 million to $30 million. It just depends on which jurisdiction it\u2019s in because we earn differently. And so that\u2019s what causes the range between $20 million to $30 million.","Ben Fowke","And also with customer class.","Teresa Madden","Yeah. That\u2019s true.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Is that electric, gas or is that a culmination of the two?","Teresa Madden","That\u2019s electric.","Ben Fowke","Gas is much lower.","Teresa Madden","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","All right. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Paz from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","Ben Fowke","Good morning.","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Most of my questions have been answered. But I just wanted to go back to one point you made on the regulatory lag and how it corresponds with the CapEx. I think said higher -- you expect higher cash flow from operations in this five-year plan versus the prior plan, due to like more spend on the gas side which has a rider and less spend on electric side which in the region, in the jurisdiction that still has some regulatory lag.","Is that the increase roughly, does that explain the increase of, I don\u2019t know, I think it was like 400 million in your cash flow from operations plan versus the prior plan?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think it\u2019s a function of the reduction in overall CapEx spend. That\u2019s about $200 million. And then improvement in the cash flows that Teresa mentioned is the other half of that basically.","And that\u2019s just, that\u2019s a function of when we put the spend in and for CSAPR and remember, that was front end loaded. That\u2019s another factor that helps us reduce the equity needs that we have a smoother spend. When we put that in, we did not have the regulatory recovery mechanism established. ","Now, we were obviously going seek that and we\u2019ll continue to seek that going forward, if we do have to make environmental spend. But at this point, we didn\u2019t have it. We had regulatory lag, contrast that with our infrastructure spend in Colorado, where we do have a rider and which eliminates lag. So, that\u2019s the delta that Teresa and we\u2019re referring to.","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Great. That helps a lot. My other question, just in your transmission line item other major projects notice both slight bump in 2017. I\u2019m just curious is there a major transmission project down in the pipe that maybe we\u2019ve missed here?","Ben Fowke","I don\u2019t think, so we\u2019re obviously have our CapX2020 programs, which are lined out that in program and then the other major CapX programs would be at SPS and some in Colorado. But these are all projects that we\u2019ve been discussing.","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And on interest costs, I just want to make sure I understand the decline for 2013, embedded in your 2013 guidance versus 2012. Is it really just a function of the lower interest cost -- lower interest rate or there are some maybe terms out before their maturity dates?","Teresa Madden","And it\u2019s primarily the interest rate.","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And last question, just in terms of your weather benefit year-to-date, I know you have for Q1, but better rest of the year, just what the net weather benefit year-to-date?","Teresa Madden","The net\u2026","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Versus normal.","Teresa Madden","Is $0.05.","David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eli Kraicer from Millennium Partners. Please go ahead.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Good morning. It\u2019s actually Steven Gambuzza.","Ben Fowke","Hi, Steve.","Teresa Madden","Good morning.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Good morning. The rate case that you\u2019re going to file in Minnesota, what will be the test year for that rate case?","Teresa Madden","2013.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay. And so you\u2019ll use a forecasted capital structure for -- the balance sheet, there is no update so just being entirely forecasted capital set of financials?","Teresa Madden","That\u2019s correct.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay. And just on the CapEx forecast, I know you spent some time in your opening remarks talking about the op rates. Have you left, I guess is the op rates spend really into the Minnesota project, which you discussed is that still in the CapEx forecast or is that been removed?","Ben Fowke","It\u2019s the $200 million spend is still in there.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay.","Ben Fowke","It\u2019s in the \u201816 and \u201817 timeframe.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay. So, if your request to the regulator is granted then you will not spend that money?","Ben Fowke","Correct.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay. And then just back to you some of David\u2019s questions on the rider. It sounds like I was looking at the nature of the capital changes. It looks like distribution CapEx for electric went up by about, both electric and gas distribution spend went up by 20 to 30% versus the prior forecast and is most of that spend now rider eligible like I know you have it in Colorado, do you -- this increase in CapEx that you have for both electric and gas distribution is the majority of that going to fall under riders?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think the gas spend as we talked about should be under a rider. The electric spend, which assumed in a multiyear plan. And -- but most of it is going to be picked up in general rate cases. And obviously, we\u2019re trying to go to multiyear and some other things to cover that.","But it\u2019s really a reflection by the way of just aging infrastructure. And we\u2019ve done a really good job with reliability for our customers. And we want to continue to keep that high standard in existence and it takes investment. And I think our commissions will see that.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay. And then my final question is just on the transmission CapEx. I\u2019m looking at that updated table and I see the CapX2020 spend in the 2013 to \u201815 timeframe. And then there is other major transmission project, $320 million in \u201816 and $415 million in \u201817. Can you just remind us what projects those are they -- I\u2019m sure I know you talked about it a bunch of the sites CapX2020 just wanted to get a feel for -- is this a handful of projects or a bunch of projects?","Ben Fowke","Probably in between a handful and a bunch.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Okay.","Ben Fowke","We\u2019ve got both. And we have TUCO, Moreland project, the Hitchland-Woodward project in Texas. We\u2019ve got the step projects in Texas. And PSCo some of the SP 100 are relatively small to the end of the five-year timeframe. A number of smaller projects, we have some things going on in Wisconsin as well, so\u2026","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Nothing, no large -- no one or two large projects that are driving it?","Ben Fowke","No. But they\u2019re not -- I mean a lot of those projects are covered through. The major projects that we refer to in the table the majority of those are covered by riders.","Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners","Great. Thanks very much for your time.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Ryder from PartnerRe Asset Management. Please go ahead.","Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management","Yeah. Hi. With the five year CapEx spending so front-end loaded. I\u2019m just wondering roughly how much debt you plan to issue in 2013. And then how that affects the credit metrics, if you don\u2019t issue equity?","Teresa Madden","We\u2019re planning to issue as right around $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion.","Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management","And the credit metrics?","Teresa Madden","They\u2019ll stay the same as they are which we are assuming that we have in the release.","Ben Fowke","I mean we shared this, our plan with rating agencies. And so everybody -- we\u2019re very transparent about what the metrics look like with both investors and the credit agencies.","Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management","Okay. And then just one quick question on how much more secured debt you can issue at SPS before you trip the negative pledge in the existing bonds?","Ben Fowke","It\u2019s about $160 million.","Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management","And will you hit that limit next year?","Ben Fowke","Not necessarily.","Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management","All right. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Cleo Zagrean from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Hi, good morning. Could you please remind us of your expectations both \u201813 in terms of trend growth rate for EPS given the slower load growth. And did you CapEx now we understand most likely it\u2019s going to be $13 billion. And any update on the mix between -- mix growth and dividend yield for total return? Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Your first and second question kind of have the same answer for both. I think we continue to see some pretty robust rate based growth over the next couple years. You get into that \u201814 time frame and beyond, perhaps it modulates a bit. There is a number of factors that will affect how much it modulates.","But overall, we\u2019re very confident that the total shareholder return of 10% can be met, whether it\u2019s a little less on EPS growth and a little more on dividend that mix ultimately remains to be seen, based upon a number of variables. But we\u2019ve got a lot of levers I think to use to continue to reward our shareholders.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Thank you. And as a follow-up with regards to load growth challenges, can you give us a brief overview of the types of regulatory recovery you\u2019re looking for besides accounting for a lower growth rate in your request. And the signals you\u2019ve received so far from regulators in terms of progress on formula rates. We -- my impression was that you were hoping maybe to move faster in Minnesota? Thank you.","Ben Fowke","The formula rates, you mean the multiyear plan?","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Yes.","Ben Fowke","It\u2019s not really a formula rate. But -- that the progress on a multiyear plan has gone a bit slower in Minnesota than we originally thought. There\u2019s a docket that\u2019s been opened and it will be very much addressed in \u201813. But we need to file a rate case now. So we filed a rate case. We\u2019ll continue to work with parties to develop a plan that might make sense. And part of that will be economic development, frankly and address things like how we help be part of the solution to get sales back on track in the state.","I think that\u2019s an important thing we can do and we have done. We already have examples of that, by the way that have played very well with our stakeholders. So having regulatory certainty, having our plans understood by our stakeholders, those ultimate lead to multiyear plans, but in the meantime we\u2019ll file a rate case. Last time we did it, we did the same way. We got a step increase for the off years.","So there\u2019s a lot of different ways that we can ensure that we have appropriate regulatory recovery. And I\u2019m actually pretty excited about the ways we can help improve sales growth and encourage growth in the state. You\u2019ll see that in rate design, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ll see that in rate designs some other things that will offer.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Thank you.","Ben Fowke","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Timothy Yee from Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Yee - Keybanc Capital Markets","Yeah. Just one quick question. For your plan rate filings in the other jurisdiction other than Minnesota, which I think would be New Mexico and North Dakota or Texas and Colorado gas, when would you expect those new rates to be in place by?","Teresa Madden","It varies by the jurisdictions. In North Dakota, we would expect interim rates early. Texas would be in the latter part of next year. New Mexico would be potentially about the same. Colorado gas that\u2019s right\u2026","Ben Fowke","\u201814.","Teresa Madden","New Mexico would be 2014. And then Colorado gas would be by the winter season next year.","Timothy Yee - Keybanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it over to Ms. Teresa Madden. Please go ahead.","Teresa Madden","Thank you all for participating in our third quarter earnings call this morning.

Welcome to the Xcel Energy Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, January 31, 2013. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson","Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2012 Year-end Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller.","This morning, we will review our 2012 results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2013 earnings guidance. There are slides that accompany today's call available on our Web page. In addition, later today, we will post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results.","As a reminder, some of the comments during this morning's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2012 GAAP earnings of $1.85 per share reflect a $0.03 per share positive impact of the restoration of tax benefits expense in 2010 associated with federal subsidies for prescription drug plans. This benefit is not included in ongoing earnings, which is consistent with our treatment in 2010. Management believes ongoing earnings provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, comments this morning will focus on ongoing earnings.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report 2012 ongoing earnings of $1.82 per share compared to $1.72 per share in 2011. This represents a 6% increase, consistent with our long-term objective of growing EPS 5% to 7%. It also marks the eighth consecutive year in which we have met or exceeded our earnings guidance and the third consecutive year in which we've delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In addition to strong earnings growth, we raised our dividend $0.04 or nearly 4%, consistent with our long-term commitment to increase the dividend 2% to 4% annually.","The financial results are particularly satisfying, considering some of the headwinds we faced in the beginning of 2012. But our financial results are only one part of many successes we had in 2012. Notably, we continue to make significant investments to refresh aging infrastructure and improve reliability. Key projects remain on track and on budget. For example, in Texas, construction of the Jones 4 unit is now 85% complete, and we continue to target a May 2013 in-service date. In Colorado, we continue to make progress on the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act project. Also in 2012, we continued our transmission build-out, investing over $700 million in a variety of projects throughout our service territories. All 4 initial CapX2020 projects have received state regulatory approval and are now in the construction phase. In addition, the entire Bemidji-Grand Rapids 230 kV line is now fully energized.","Looking ahead, we plan to invest over $1 billion in 2013 transmission projects. To finance these initiatives, we took advantage of historically low interest rates, issuing $1.8 billion in first mortgage bonds in 2012. Our credit quality remains high, and there's strong demand for our bonds. More specifically, at NSP-Minnesota, we issued a $300 million 10-year bond priced at a 2.15% coupon, and a $500 million 30-year bond priced at a 3.4% coupon.  Both of these represented record low utility coupons for their respective tenors. The $800 million of PSCo bonds were issued at slightly higher rates, but still among the lowest for the utility sector. Locking in these low rates will provide benefits to our customers for years to come.","Our customers also benefited from continued high levels of reliability. As you recall, the mild winter gave way to a hot and stormy summer season. I'm proud to say that our system held up extraordinarily well, and our reliability scores were among the best in the nation. Good reliability underscores how our strategy of prudently investing in our systems results in excellent service, even when faced with extreme weather cycles and events. Our customers appreciate excellent service, as our consistently high satisfaction scores indicate.","And 2012 was a big year with several rate cases completed and filed. Of note, we implemented a multi-year plan in Colorado and reached constructive outcomes in several other cases.","Finally, I'm really proud of how we achieved these results. We improved employee safety by almost 20%, making 2012 our best year ever.","In summary, I couldn't have asked for a better first full year as Chairman and CEO. We certainly plan to build on these successes and add to our solid track record of performance in 2013 and beyond.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I will discuss year-end results, provide an update on our regulatory proceedings, review our 2013 financing plan and reiterate our 2013 earnings guidance.","Let's begin a review of 2012 results at each of our 4 operating companies. 2012 earnings at PSCo increased $0.08 per share, primarily due to the multi-year electric rate plan implemented in May and warmer summer weather. Earnings at NSP-Minnesota decreased $0.03 per share due to warmer than normal winter weather, lower weather-normalized electric sales, as well as higher property taxes, O&M and depreciation expenses. SPS earnings increased $0.04 per share as a result of rate increases implemented in both New Mexico and Texas in January 2012. Finally, earnings at NSP-Wisconsin were flat.  While we had some ups and downs by company, the consolidated results clearly emphasize the benefits of diversification.","Now I'll review some of the key items that affected the consolidated income statement beginning with electric margin. For the year, electric margin increased $118 million, driven primarily by $125 million of rate increases across all 8 states. Other positive factors included increased demand and transmission revenue. In addition, conservation and DSM incentives also helped to improve retail electric margin. Overall, weather was not a driver of the increase in electric margin. While summer weather was warmer than normal in 2012, we also experienced a hot summer in 2011.","These positive drivers were partially offset by a $48 million decrease related to the expiration of a long-term power sale agreement with Black Hills Corporation, effective at the beginning of 2012. While it varies by jurisdiction, weather-normalized consolidated electric sales were flat for the year. However, when eliminating the impact of Leap Day in 2012, sales declined by 0.3%. We believe that sluggish sales were driven by a combination of the economy, conservation efforts and improvements in appliance, efficiency and saturation. In addition, we lost a couple of large customers in Minnesota, which reduced our sale by about 0.5%.","Natural gas margins increased $8 million for the year, reflecting the implementation of the pipeline system integrity rider in Colorado, as well as new rates in Colorado and Wisconsin. These positive factors were primarily offset by the negative impact of weather and a decrease in conservation and DSM revenue. Due to the record warm winter experienced across much of our service territory, firm natural gas sales decreased 11%, reducing consolidated EPS by approximately $0.035 when compared to 2011. On a weather-normalized basis, sales declined by about 1%.","Turning to expenses. O&M increased $36 million or 1.7% for the year. Virtually the entire annual O&M increase occurred during the fourth quarter. Primary drivers of the increase were employee benefits, including pension costs; the pipeline system integrity costs, partially offset by lower plant generation costs, lower bad debt expense and other smaller items. After implementing cost management initiatives at the beginning of the year to offset warmer than normal winter weather and other headwinds, we held O&M flat for the first 3 quarters of the year. However, after experiencing a very hot summer, we took advantage of this favorable situation, investing more in our operating infrastructure to help maintain high levels of reliability going forward.","Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a $10 million charge related to the Minnesota Commission's approval to terminate the Prairie Island upgrade project as well as an $11 million charge associated with the recent ALJ recommendation to disallow the recovery of certain costs of our smart grid city project in Colorado. Because we pursued the Prairie Island upgrade project under the terms of an approved certificate of need and the investment did yield tangible and significant benefits for these customers, we plan to seek recovery of our full investment including return on these costs in our 2014 rate case. Looking ahead, we anticipate that higher nuclear, health care, chemical and other costs will drive a 2013 O&M increase of approximately 4% to 5% over 2012. Longer term, we forecast O&M to grow 3% to 4% annually.","One additional year-end variance of note was within other taxes, which increased $34 million or 9.1%, largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota.","I'll now provide an update on a few of our regulatory proceedings touching on certain key items. Significant details related to our rate cases can be found in today's press release. Late last year, we filed several cases, which will impact both 2013 and 2014. These rate cases reflect the continued investment in our utilities. Primary drivers of such investments are to replace aging infrastructure to ensure excellent reliability. These investments are expected to provide outstanding value to our customers and create jobs in our community.","In December, we reached constructive outcomes in our Wisconsin electric and gas cases, with new rates becoming effective earlier this month. In the electric case, the Commission approved a $35.5 million increase compared to our $39.1 million request. In the natural gas case, the Commission approved a $2.7 million increase compared to our $5.3 million request. As part of this approval, we will begin cost recovery for the Ashland environmental remediation, which for the first time includes a return on the unamortized balance. This was done to offset the longer amortization time period, which will minimize the customer impact.","In South Dakota, we implemented interim rates in January, subject to refunds, while we continued to work with the staff to reach a settlement in the ongoing rate case. In November, in Minnesota, we filed a $285 million electric rate increase request based on a 2013 test year, and a 10.6% ROE and a 52.56% equity ratio. An interim increase of $251 million was approved and implemented on January 1. The procedural schedule for this case has been established. Key dates include Intervenor's testimony on February 28, rebuttal testimony on March 25, evidentiary hearings beginning April 18 and an ALJ report on July 3. We anticipate a Commission decision this fall.","We also filed several other cases during the fourth quarter of 2012, which include a $90 million electric rate request in Texas, which is based on an ROE of 10.65%. We anticipate a decision this summer with final rates effective by midyear.","In Colorado, we filed a $70 million multi-year natural gas rate case based on a forward test year and a 10.5% ROE. This request includes a $48.5 million increase in 2013 with step increases of $9.9 million in 2014 and $12.1 million in 2015. As part of the Colorado natural gas case, we also requested an extension and expansion of the pipeline integrity rider. In addition, we requested a $5 million increase in steam rates over the next 3 years. We anticipate a Commission decision on these requests later this year, with final rates expected to be effective in the third quarter.","In North Dakota, we filed an electric case seeking a $17 million increase based on a forecast test year and a 10.6% ROE. Interim rates, subject to refunds, have been approved by the Commission and will go into effect in mid-February. We anticipate a Commission decision in the third quarter, with final rates effective in the fourth quarter.","Finally, in New Mexico, we filed an electric case seeking a $46 million increase based on a forecast test year and a 10.65% ROE. We anticipate a Commission decision later this year, with final rates effective in 2014. We remain confident that while each request will receive scrutiny, the requests are well-grounded, driven primarily by necessary capital investments. And as a result, we will ultimately add to our track record of constructive outcomes.","Turning to capital expenditures. We've updated our 5-year forecast to reflect the termination of the Prairie Island uprate project. We now anticipate spending approximately $13 billion over the next 5 years. In addition, we've updated our projected cash from operations to reflect a recent extension of bonus depreciation. As a result of these changes, we've reduced our overall projected 5-year financing needs. In 2013, we intend to issue approximately $1 billion of first mortgage bonds to finance our capital expenditures during the first half of the year, including $500 million at PSCo, $400 million at NSP-Minnesota and $100 million at SPS.","This morning, we are reaffirming our 2013 ongoing guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 per share. We've updated some of the guidance assumptions to reflect 2012 actual results. Details of these changes can be found in today's press release.","In closing, we're pleased to deliver another solid year. Despite experiencing early challenges, we moved aggressively to rightsize our O&M without negatively impacting customer service or safety. These efforts, combined with constructive outcomes in several rate cases and hot summer weather, helped us achieve ongoing earnings growth of 6%, consistent with our 5% to 7% target. As Ben indicated, we have now met or exceeded our annual earnings guidance 8 years in a row.","We also raised dividend by nearly 4%, consistent with our goal of 2% to 4% annual increases and marking this as the ninth consecutive year of achieving this objective. We issued $1.8 billion of first mortgage bonds at attractive rates, lowering our coupon rates and extending our maturities.","On the regulatory front, we again achieved constructive outcomes in a variety of cases, adding to our solid track record of managing multiple rate cases across our jurisdiction. On the operational front, we made excellent progress on our capital investment program, delivered strong reliability and improved our customer satisfaction scores.","Overall, it was another great year for Xcel Energy.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies & Co.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. One is, actually, when I compare third quarter '12 and fourth quarter '12 interest expense, it looks like interest expense has gone down by $10 million. I know, I think, third quarter you guys had some maybe principal payments in there, but that was roughly $3 million. I just want to know if you can give some more color on the $7 million. And the second question is, I guess, you've had an increase in AFUDC year-over-year, I just want to know if you can highlight what projects you have that are building up the equip balance?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, maybe if we start with the AFUDC. In terms of the rate will, in part, be higher because we have higher equip balances this year. So that's a primary driver in terms of the variance there. And then the interest expense, the changes in that, I mean, we basically refinanced a substantial amount of debt during the year. But that was all completed by the end of the third quarter, so the differences are driving that fourth quarter variance.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Are there any particular projects though that are driving the higher equip balances?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, it's -- in Minnesota, we've had a lot of spend in CapX2020. We've also had a lot of spend in Clean Air-Clean Jobs in Colorado. So those are the 2 biggest, and Jones 4 also in Texas. So those are the big projects that we're working on right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As you mentioned, your guidance embeds O&M expenses growth of 4% to 5% in 2013. That's a little higher than the utility average and higher than you came in this year as well. Can you provide more details on what's driving this? And is there flexibility to manage this if low disappoints?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, maybe if we could start with 2012 variance to '11, we only had an increase of 1.7%. So we have a relatively low level that we're starting from in 2012. So it's driving somewhat the increase of 4% to 5%. But the drivers in terms of 2013, we'll start with nuclear. We do have some increases in our nuclear costs. The second piece of that is pensions. Pensions, we are assuming now a 4% discount rate, so we're seeing increases in that. And then we have just some -- across the board, some higher insurance, some small amount of bad debt and some chemicals in some of our plant-related costs. In the long run, we expect to go back to a 3% to 4% overall increase on an annual basis.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And in Minnesota, obviously, a lot of attention on the regulatory front there. Do you think there's the possibility of a multi-year rate deal in Minnesota? And if not, should we be thinking about Xcel going back and filing in 2014 for 2015 rates?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, I don't know if I -- first of all, I don't know if I'd classify it as tension, if I heard you right. As far as the multiyear plans go, I mean, the Commission continues to study that and we'll get their reaction -- their formal reaction later in the year. So that, along with some other reasons is the reason why we filed a single test year case this year, and that's what we're proceeding to march forward with. As far as what we'll do in 2014 and 2015 we'll obviously take a look at what the Commission decides on the applicability of a multi-year test years, and we'll file accordingly.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the last question is in terms of regional trends in terms of demand growth. Are you continuing to see strength in Texas and relative challenges in Minnesota? And what are you seeing in Colorado?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, everything -- overall, on the residential side, it's safe to say everything is pretty flat. So then you move to the C&I side, and actually, the strongest C&I growth was in Wisconsin this year, followed by Texas, I think, followed by Colorado, which had small growth. And then we were -- we didn't grow at all in Minnesota for a number of reasons. That said, the economy definitely saw some signs of improvement in 2012. Housing permits were up. Job growth was better than the national average. Unemployment was equal to or better than the national average. So I think the economies are in decent shape across all our jurisdictions. Doesn't necessarily mean it translates to high sales growth. And that's consistent with our forecast. I mean, we're not anticipating that we're going to see a tremendous rebound in sales, even as the economies start to improve. I mean, I think, that's our new normal, frankly.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the 1% decline in gas sales that you're projecting for 2013, what are you seeing now that we're in 2013 and essentially know what some of the drivers would be on that demand side? What are the key drivers that you're seeing on that?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, maybe I'll start with 2013. We haven't closed out January, so we haven't actually seen our January results. But we would expect to see consistent what we saw last year. Again, the drivers of it are primarily the same thing in terms of some efficiency use among our customers, but the same overall trends to a certain degree that we've seen in our electric business.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What's the EPS impact on that in your guidance?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Very minimal, Travis. There's not a lot of gas margin, so it's not going to have much impact.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can you again remind us, Teresa, at the OpCo level, what's the current regulatory lag in your system in terms of earned ROEs versus authorized?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, the regulatory lag tends to be between 50 to 100 basis points, and it's going to depend which jurisdiction has had the most recent rate increase in place. So we tend to have more regulatory lag, like in Texas, where we're using a historical test year. Although I will say that in terms of ROEs relative to the 2012 period, they actually ended up in the 9%. So really, if we just look at 2012, all utilities, except for NSP-Min, we're in 9% return range, actually in the middle, and NSP-Minnesota was slightly less than 9%. But we're seeing some regulatory lag in part. That's why we're filing such a large case.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also on that Minnesota case, how concerned are you guys about this recent -- the request that the Commission posed to you about looking at potentially reducing the authorized equity ratio? Can you give us some insight on that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, Ali, I mean, we're always concerned when we're filing a rate case. But I mean, we've been filing rate cases for a number of years now and these issues are always reviewed. What is the Commission going to be interested in? The appropriate ROE, the appropriate equity ratio, whether expenses are justified. And I think we'll do fine in just all of those areas. I mentioned, and I think Teresa did too, I mean, we issued some of the lowest record coupons of debt last year. Well, you can't do that unless you have a good credit profile. And if you -- and I think our Commissions understand that. And so while I think it gets looked at, I think, at the end of the day, the constructive regulatory compact continues.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And also, the impact of bonus depreciation, as we look into '13, your share count still implies some potential for equity issuance on the higher end. But can you just give us an update on your insights there because of bonus depreciation? Is it less likely as you'll issue equity this year or what are you thinking right now?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I mean, as you can see in the release, Ali, we expect -- we have changed that number now to $400 million over the next 5 years. We do have, as you can see, our capital program is very front-end loaded in terms of the 5-year period. So we do think we have flexibility in terms of issuing equity and it probably will be more front-end loaded, either 2013 or 2014. But we've provided for that range and that's really indicating we do believe we have some flexibility.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Last question, also, if you can remind us, if you look at your CapEx program '13 through '17, if you translate that into rate base growth using '12 as a base year, so over the next 5 years, what kind of rate base growth does that support?","Teresa S. Madden","If we look at the first 2 years, I mean, we continue at our 6% rate, and then that will -- that'd be '13 and '14, and then, of course then, we taper down after that through the remainder of the period.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","What, like 5% to 10%?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, it's around there.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, and, Ali, I think it's important to note that we are not anticipating a tremendous amount of sales growth. Therefore, we aren't anticipating the need for new generation. So, as you know, having followed us for years, our CapEx forecasts can certainly change as those out years become the current years. And we'll look at what's happening with the economy and what our customer needs are, et cetera. I think as we've also spoke about, if those CapEx plans don't change, Teresa is right, the rate base grow slows and that will translate to slower growth for us and of course, that's when we can do more with the dividend. And I think we've got lots of options to reward investors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Macquarie capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","A few questions on behalf of Angie Storozynski. First question is you talked quite a bit qualitatively about the load growth expectations, but can you give us the number that you're expecting for 2013 and in the long term?","Teresa S. Madden","Sure. I mean, in terms of 2013, maybe if I just talk about it by operating company.  We're -- for NSP-Minnesota, we're looking at a decrease of about 1.2%, NSP-Wisconsin expected to be flat. In Colorado, just under 1%, actually, that's more about 0.6%. And in Colorado -- I mean, excuse me, and in Texas, over -- just around 3%, I would say. So overall, we expect it to come in between up to 0.5% on a consolidated basis.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","And in the longer term?","Teresa S. Madden","In the longer term, for the next 5 years, we're projecting just up to 1%.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Then with the CapEx, obviously some downsizing of certain -- or termination of projects and downsizing of the overall. Are there any other projects that you see as particularly at risk if the load growth doesn't recover or gets worse?","Teresa S. Madden","I don't think we see any particularly at risk. I mean, a lot of them are infrastructure projects.  We have some transmission projects that are underway that we need to complete like CapX2020.  We have some larger ones in progress in Texas as well, so in terms of that risk, we don't see that right now.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Then lastly, you've talked in the past about the long-term EPS guidance of 5% to 7%. Is that still your target and expectation?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, as Teresa and I both said, I think that's our expectation for the next couple of years. And after that, we'll have to take a look at what happens with our CapEx plans. Again, we're not -- as we just spoke to, we're not anticipating too much sales growth. That would certainly change. We'll have to see how the regulatory outcomes proceed and the macroeconomic conditions, et cetera, and environmental regulations which, by the way, we're very well-positioned to meet. But if the CapEx forecast stays the same, yes, I think you'll see that EPS growth rate modulate as we -- and again, it gives us a chance to take a look at what the growth rate of our dividend ought to be.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, very good. And just one last thing here. You mentioned, I believe, that in the quarter, Wisconsin was actually stronger than Texas. Yet for '13, you're expecting Wisconsin flat and Texas up 3%. Was there anything unusual in the quarter in Wisconsin driving that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","We were speaking year-to-date, weren't we, right?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes. We were speaking year-to-date. And what Ben indicated, we have seen some uptick in the sand mining industry. So maybe we have some more upside in Wisconsin as we look forward. But we're being conservative about that. Clearly, we've seen the oil and gas impact.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Michael Bates with D.A. Davidson & Co.","Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","If we could, I'd like to circle back to your financing plan a little bit. When you compare this forecast with what you had previously indicated, it looks like your cash from operations increased roughly $400 million, can you just go over that with us again?  What has changed in the last few months that drove that increase?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, there's 2 things that have changed. First, we've taken out the $200 million related to the EPU uprate in Minnesota that we're -- that's the Prairie Island, which we're not pursuing. And then we've also incorporated the impacts of -- President Obama just signed into law the extension of bonus depreciation for 2013 at the 50% level, which for us, will actually continue into 2014, because of our long-term projects. So it's a combination of those that are driving the decrease in terms of that need.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Eli Kraicer with Millennium Partners.","Steven Gambuzza","It's actually Steve Gambuzza. The impacts of bonus depreciation that you just highlighted, can you just review the impact that it will have on the rate base that you've, I guess, previously disclosed for '13 and '14?","Teresa S. Madden","Sure. I mean, in total, it's about $300 million, about 2\/3 of that or about $200 million in '13, and $100 million in '14.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","One more. What's the situation in Boulder? An update there? And any impacts in 2013 or even 2014 depending on how the negotiations go?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I don't think there will any impacts in '13 or '14. I mean, what's going on there is that the staff, the consultants, et cetera, will make a recommendation to the city council whether or not they go forward, and that's supposed to take place, I believe, in April?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, February, yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","February is when they get the recommendation, and they'll rule on it in April.","Teresa S. Madden","Right.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","And so we'll see. But regardless, I mean, we currently serve them, as you know, Travis. And so if they decide they don't want to serve us, that begins what is a pretty lengthy and long process, and we'll continue to serve them through that process.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Andy Levi with Avon capital.","Andrew Levi","Just back to Minnesota because I think there's been some, I don't know if you want us to call it misinformation or maybe people being a little bit overzealous in their assumptions. But just back to the kind of equity debt issue that's been brought up, I know you made a filing on Friday regarding that.  Can you kind of just talk about that as far as what your perception is on what may or may not happen? And then there's been 1 or 2 sales side reports that have talked about fairly, not large numbers, but as much as $0.10 of possible earnings effect from that, which we can't come up with anywhere close to that. So I don't know if there's a way that you can walk us through kind of looking at the rate base and how that would be affected if there was a 1% or 2% change in the debt\/equity ratio. And if there was, I don't know how you would get there, would you buy back stock? How would that work?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Okay. Well, Andy, let me take a stab at it and I'll ask for help if we're not completing your question. I mean, the first thing, I think, you noted is our capital structure study was approved. And that has, I believe, the 52-point-something equity ratio in it. So -- and I think the questions were raised were how do we take advantage of this historically low interest rate environment, which of course we are. And we're doing that now because we can issue debt with good credit ratings which results in these great rates. So obviously, if you were to dilute that credit rating through a poor equity structure, you wouldn't be able to take advantage of that. So having the capital structure approved, I think, was a good signal. The other question, I think you asked was on an analyst's report that said if the ROE, I think, fell 500 basis points, it would have a $0.10 impact. I mean, we struggle a little bit to get that number too, and that's a pretty big fall. I think that also doesn't assume, Andy, that we would take any reaction to it, which I think is the latter part of your question. Certainly, if we had a major adjustment to our credit ratio, we'd have to adjust our financing plan. And I mean, there would be a number of ways you could do that. You would reduce equity injections from the whole co, et cetera, and you'd get the equity ratio to where the Commission wanted it to be. I don't think that would be a good result ultimately for our customers. And I do think that there has been more emphasis placed on it than perhaps it warrants. Again, we've got, I think, a thoughtful Commission and we've got a constructive regulatory compact. It's never easy to file rate cases. We take it very seriously. But all you have to look at is what are we trying to accomplish? Relicensing our nuclear plants for another 20 years, keeping our infrastructure reliable and resilient and being on the forefront of getting ready for these environmental challenges, which I think really are starting to pay dividend for our customers as we look at mats, rules and other things like that, that we've been very well prepared for. So I do think there's any question we're spending our money in the right place. And I don't think there's any question that a strong balance sheet is necessary to complete these capital programs. So, biggest risk we face every year is public policy risk, and we've been facing it for years and managing it. And I'm cautiously optimistic we'll have a good year managing those rate cases this year as well.","Andrew Levi","And then the other question I had is based on the refinancings that you did in 2012, and then I guess we saw in the fourth quarter, and I understand that you'll be issuing more debt. But just on the refinancing, how much is the annual savings do you think on that?","Teresa S. Madden","The annual savings was about $30 million to $35 million from the refinancing.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And how much of that was realized in 2012?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, some of our midyear -- I mean, I would say about half potentially.","Operator","And at this, time I'm showing no further questions.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paul Johnson","Good morning. And welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2019 second quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric margin and natural gas margin. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin Fowke","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past.","So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest resource plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited coal in the Upper Midwest.","The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of a combined cycle natural gas plant at Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind to replacement.","Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 2030 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon-free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner sustainable energy future for our customers.","We also continue to make strong progress on our steel-for-fuel strategy. In June, our 478-megawatt Hale Wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees.","The legislative sessions are now completed in our states, and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, 3 bills passed: a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects; a bill that provides right of recovery for new generation; and a bill that provides right of recovery for AMI investment. These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas.","In Colorado, legislation passed that classified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. Also in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure.","Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This rule targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition, and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon-reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best for Vest Employers ranking. This is the 6th straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans, and the company has reached that goal every year. Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans bring strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job; their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day.","So now I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who's a Navy vet, to provide you more detail on the quarterly results and regulatory plans. Bob?","Robert Frenzel","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings or $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and writers to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather.","In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin, and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. And higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share.","Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflects some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance to 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance.","Turning to O&M. Our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs in 2019. We expect lower plant outage in nuclear operation cost in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements.","Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance that full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $6.6 million, an equity ratio of 56%, an ROE of 9.67% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur in 2 steps: in 2019 and October of 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending at Colorado commission decision.","In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking an increase of $158 million or 5.7% based on historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, an equity ratio of 56.46% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our advanced group initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the commission. PSCo's requested rate is effective in January of 2020. We also reached a settlement in Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021 and result in a modest natural gas rate decrease. The settlement is pending a commission decision.","In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020. In addition, we are planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale Wind farm.","Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter, we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition, however, their recommendations included alternate customer protection mechanisms if the commission approves the acquisition. We believe we've demonstrated the economics of ownership were still compelling despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic the commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that our ownership of the facility would create.","Additionally, we are actively working across our 4 operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and will work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the cost, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions, and we will share these developments as they progress. With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range.","In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota resource planning proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition and if approved, will allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale Wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado. Constructive legislation was passed in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance and our long-term objectives of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Alex Morgan","This is Alex Morgan, calling in for Julien. And congratulations on the results and being able to maintain the year-end guidance and maybe on the upper end of the range. I had a few quick questions. And the first one, I was wondering if you could provide any more regulatory environment color specifically around New Mexico and Colorado. In New Mexico, I know that PNM, for example, is potentially struggling around whether securitization will apply to its future plans. I was wondering if we should interpret that as the commission looking at different rate cases with a fine-tooth comb. And then in Colorado as well, I was just hoping for a little more color over there.","Benjamin Fowke","Color in Colorado around securitization?","Alex Morgan","Just in terms of the regulatory environment and the pending rate cases in both.","Benjamin Fowke","Well, let's start with Colorado. I mean I think -- we continue to think we have a constructive environment. We're very much aligned with the policymakers in the state. If you look at what we're filing in that rate case, it's really capital oriented. And as Bob mentioned, most of the capital that we're talking about has already been approved. So I think it continues to be very constructive, and it helps when you're keeping your bills -- total bills very flat. In fact, in Colorado, they're less today than they were 4, 5 years ago. So I think we're in very good position in Colorado.","Moving to New Mexico. First of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico, is just really stunning, and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that support a better regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico. Now securitization for us in New Mexico is not a very big deal. So I can't give you much more color on that. But I do like the -- I actually think the new administration and some of the changes in the commission are very positive for New Mexico and positive for SPS overall.","Robert Frenzel","One other thing to point out Alex, we did reach a very constructive settlement with the New Mexico commission, which allowed for an ROE of just over 9.5% and an equity ratio of 54% earlier in the first quarter. And that was, I think, a good set of data points for the commission.","Alex Morgan","That's very helpful. One quick question on the updates around PPAs rolling off. Is there a date by which these need to be announced to take advantage of tax benefits? Or is this something that we'll see just rolling into the 2020s, whether or not the PTC can be triggered? If there's any wind the PPAs rolling off that you might take in-house.","Robert Frenzel","Alex, I don't think there's any deadlines on any of the PPA buyout strategies that we've discussed. And while some of them may be triggered by repowering of various from wind farms, I would say that's the only trigger for an opportunity for us to potentially buy in one of these assets that we already contract for the benefit of our customers.","Alex Morgan","And last quick question. On Mankato, in terms of the time line of the commission decision, when are you thinking about that?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I think the commission is scheduled -- or will most likely take it up in September -- probably in the middle of September. And so we'll have our answer then.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller","Texas, you made some comments there about the positive regulatory environment developments there, especially on the transmission side. Would you anticipate potentially putting more capital to work in that state now?","Benjamin Fowke","No. Well, I mean, it's growing pretty significantly, and there's a lot of capital that needs to be put into keep up with that growth. And there was wider mechanisms that we have both for the meter investment, the right of first refusal and of course, of the writer for new gen are very supportive of putting more capital to work at SPS.","Robert Frenzel","And Travis, this is Bob, we're working through our long-term financial planning process and capital planning process, and we expect to be back with guidance in the third quarter.","Travis Miller","Okay. So if I recall correctly, it rolls off pretty quickly in Texas, at least after the wind farms, right? So that could possibly come up in the 2021-type range?","Robert Frenzel","Yes. I would say that the wind farms are certainly a large and discrete investment, but our run rate capital in SPS is positive driven by increased load and increased customer growth there.","Travis Miller","Got it. Yes. And then very high level, if we look back over the last 10 years, you guys have been right at the forefront of smaller deals. Gas plus renewables offsetting coal, I think, in the coal retirements. As you look forward kind of in the next 10 years, once coal essentially comes out of texture for you, guys, are we in an environment where it's gas versus renewables, or the that solar or wind, but is that the offset? Is that the competition assuming very flat or little growth on the demand side?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, I think -- thank you, Travis, for that. I mean first of all, let's get to that 80% milestone, which is a big milestone by 2030. I mentioned, we will be completely out of coal in the Midwest. Still have some coal after that on our system, so there'd be more transitioning. I think gas and renewables and the extension of niche will make all the sense on how we continue on that path to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. I don't think they really compete with each other. They're going to -- they'll support each other at that point. Of course, we'll also be looking at the role batteries can play on our grid, the role batteries can play with storage. I think it'll be even more important to have demand response-type programs. And of course, we're very excited about EVs and what that might mean to our system and the interactions -- new interactions that can create with our customers.","Travis Miller","Okay. And do you still see a role for gas in a 100%-type carbon-free environment? How would that -- how do you see that vision?","Benjamin Fowke","Yes. Very good question. I mean by 2050, unless those plants are burning renewable gas, which is certainly a possibility, you wouldn't want them on the grid. But that is a number of decades away. And I think it's incredibly important that you take early action. And so I think gas is how we move away from coal, how we maintain reliability, how we maintain affordability. We get to that 80% mark, and as I've said before, we're going to need to work on those technologies to get that last bit of carbon off of our system. There's a lot of different things it could be. But for now, we need to take early action, and gas is the avenue to get us there.","Operator","And our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","So in Colorado, there has been some discussion about some wind contractors who have been basically not signing on to the contracts, that have been basically backing out of their deal with you guys because the price has been too low. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that and what you're seeing in terms of having to recontract and sort of what we'll start seeing in the economics out there.","Benjamin Fowke","Paul, are you talking about wind? Or are you talking about solar?","Paul Patterson","I thought it was wind. I thought it was renewal contracts...","Benjamin Fowke","Well, we had -- well, what I'm familiar with, and I asked David Eves to help out if I'm missing something. But we have some solar contracts, one of which was going to support our deal with the EVRAZ steel mill. That particular vendor pulled out due to the economics and the change of ownership. The good news is we've gone out with bids and have received very attractive replacement bids. So I think things remain on track in Colorado, both for the CEP plan as well as our unique deal to keep EVRAZ right there on Colorado and expanding. David, did I miss anything? Okay.","Paul Patterson","Okay. So what I'm reading here about some wind contractors backing out that, that is the -- that, that article is inaccurate, I guess, is that correct? I can follow up with you guys afterwards. I just saw the -- okay, we can talk about it afterwards.","Benjamin Fowke","So let's follow up on it. If I'm missing something, we can look at it. But we've had, in the past, remember, we have stepped into some wind developer contracts that were -- they couldn't make it happen, and we came in and taken over the project and made it happen for the benefit of our customers. I think that probably points to a strong reason why you continue to want to have a mix of PPAs and utility ownership because we've demonstrated we can bring things to the table. But -- and when you do a big solicitation, you're going to have some bids that can't cut the mustard in the end, and you just keep moving to the next bit or you step in and take it over yourself. But I don't see this as anything but business as usual.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And you don't see any change, okay. So it sounds like because, yes, there might be some people dropping out, but for most part, you haven't seen any change in the economics or anything significant in terms of renewable development and the outlook for the CEP or anything. Is that a good way to summarize that?","Benjamin Fowke","That's absolutely right, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. And then also just picking up on the storage discussion that you mentioned, I know that you have 235 megawatts, I believe you do, under the CEP. And this is wondering in general, we're seeing a lot of discussion, different developers talking about combined renewables with a battery coming in quite cheap in different RFPs. I'm just wondering, since you guys are sort of big on this stuff, what you're seeing and how you see the economics of that developing sort of beat this -- or cheaper than a peaker, that kind of thing. What are you guys seeing practically on the ground? What was your outlook there?","Benjamin Fowke","So great question, and we are seeing some very attractive bids, and you mentioned the 275-megawatt battery project. That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall on price and over time overcome the roll-off of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new peakers but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean because, as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very viable and you planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off of that very peak load, you start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability, and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear.","Robert Frenzel","Paul, one thing I'd add on to Ben's comments is we did do a broad solicitation for the Colorado Energy Plan. We published the results of that solicitation with averages, and we published the solar-only and a solar-plus storage average. I don't have the numbers at my fingertips. But if you want more details on what we saw about 18 months ago on the solicitation, we can share that with you. Obviously, the markets move for both solar and for storage assets, and we continue to see price declines in both of those asset classes. But I think that those midpoints will highlight to you how competitive some of that stuff is becoming over time.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert Frenzel","Thanks for participating in our second quarter earnings call this morning. We look forward to seeing people on the road in the third quarter. We have quite a queue for conferences and road shows that we highlight in our investor materials.

As a result, we made outstanding progress achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. But we want to do even more, which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer term, we expect to deliver our customers 100% carbon free energy by 2050.","These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry and I am confident with supportive public policy, we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable. Technologies come a long way in the last ten years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon free bill can be met as well. We look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve.","We're also very focused on our customers. Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our Sherco plant in Minnesota. As you may remember, back in 2015, we announced our attention to close two of the Sherco coal units. This particular location for the new data center will create jobs, bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition, we are planning to serve the data centers energy needs with 100% renewable energy, and I believe our environmental leadership will lead to even more economic development opportunities over time.","We also recently filed to expand our pilot renewable connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources, has been extremely popular and has commissioned approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly, Renewable Connect does not negatively impact the bills of non-participants. And we anticipate that future expansions at Google and in Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?","Bob Frenzel","Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. As Ben discussed, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017, representing the top-end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional O&M expense, which offsets the weather benefit.","Looking at the income statement, the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.44 per share, largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales as well as rate increases and riders to recover our capital investments and higher AFUDC equity, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share, reflecting growth in capital investments.","Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14. Turning to sales, our weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018, reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth.","Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth driven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use, largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment. For 2019, we are anticipating relatively flat electric sales, which reflect some specific declines in large customer usage, more modest oil and natural gas driven growth and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019 reflecting continued growth and C&I and residential loads.","Turning to expenses, O&M increased by $82 million, or 3.6%, reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer. Business systems cost investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. While we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas, including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cyber security and enhancing the customer experience, we are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017.","Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed and resolve multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019, we're planning to file a Colorado electric case in the spring, rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in the summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020.","With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the five year time period. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy, receiving regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760 megawatt Mankato Natural Gas Plant and buyout 70 megawatts of wind PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we\u2019ll now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Ben Fowke","Yeah, you are a little faint, but good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent, well, I appreciate it. Good morning. Congratulations again on the results.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Maybe just to touch base a little bit, I know there's a litany of difference regulatory, more importantly legislative angles for this year. Can you touch base a little bit on them by state \u2013 specifically Texas, Colorado and the status in Minnesota? I know something just came up there as well since to go through across the three\u2026","Ben Fowke","So there's a whole bunch of them. There is a lot of things. There's \u2013 it's pretty busy legislative agenda. So why don't I touch on a few that we're looking at it and if I miss one, please ask a follow-up question, Julien. Starting in Texas, of course we're interested in the AMI legislation that would basically allow non-ERCOT companies to get the same regulatory treatment that that ERCOT companies receive concurrent recovery that\u2019s particularly important. It's important to note there that in our CapEx and the CapEx in the forecast period, we anticipate about $80 million spend of AMI. So wouldn\u2019t increase the capital too much there, Julien, but the recovery would be great. And we're optimistic about that. Over in New Mexico, of course, we're following the RPS standard to see where that goes and watching the securitization bell as well. Moving up to Colorado, there is a number of different things proposed in Colorado.","The securitization bill is one that we're following. Our thought there is it could be another tool in the toolbox if you will. That said, you know, some of the things that we've already accomplished leading the clean energy transition while keeping those flat taking care of our community something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees. I think we've shown we can do and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but the securitization bills that it can become a valuable voluntary tool. Well, that will be great. Minnesota, there's just a number of things going around; some addresses the community solar gardens. Most of those are \u2013 most of the legislation I would say in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there's something specific that you're interested in, in Minnesota, just a follow up. Did I catch everything you're interested in? Or I missed anything, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","No, I think you did. I mean, I'm more curious as you think about some of these playing out, are there any specific capital items that coming out of these that you would be focused on the Colorado or otherwise, but I know there's a lot, that's why I wanted to get the priorities from you if you will.","Ben Fowke","Well, no. If any of those bills will drive much incremental capital, I mean, I am \u2013 there\u2019s the EV storage bill that could be helpful to us and would allow us to do more with basically seating what I think is going to be a very interesting development in the future and that's the electrification of transport. So that could drive some CapEx, but a little early to put anything hard dollars on the table, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. And just a quick clarification if I can. On the capital investment forecast that EEI you provided an incremental case in the billion dollars of additional capital. Obviously, you're changing around slides every update. Is there anything to read into that?","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean I think we shifted some things from 2019 and 2020, but we overall \u2013 and we put the Mankato and the wind farm into our base forecast now, but the overall spend is still roughly the same I believe in that timeframe. So in those out years, we are still looking to have achieved that incremental case, which would grow rate base by about 7%. And I think we can get there in a number of different ways. Of course, we continue to look for opportunities to buyout PPAs and other opportunistic things. So that and the fact that if you look at history, Julien, the out years tend to be more capital intensive as the out years become forward years.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thanks for clarifying that.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ben Fowke","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning. First question, I wanted to just clarify. Ben, I think you have mentioned you're expecting both the Mankato and the 70 megawatt buyout approval to happen. Did you say by the third quarter? I just wanted to clarify when you are expecting that.","Ben Fowke","Yeah, I think that's a good timeline to think about, end of the second quarter or early third quarter.","Ali Agha","Okay. And with the $20.1 billion five year CapEx that does equate to 6.5% rate base CAGR as you had previously shown us. Is that correct?","Ben Fowke","Correct.","Ali Agha","Okay. And to - if I think about, the long-term earnings goal aspiration of 5% to 7% to hit the high end of that 7%, does that assume that you would get that incremental billion dollars, so that rate base could also be growing at 7% or do you think the high end growth rate can be achieved just based on the CapEx as you have laid out today?","Ben Fowke","I mean, I think the incremental CapEx would certainly be helpful, but there are other levers as well. Improvement in a regulatory outcomes, specifically higher ROEs, that would also be very helpful. Sales, we've got \u2013 we had a good year in 2018. We expect it to be a little bit flatter in 2019 and beyond, but if we got some pickup there that would be helpful. And of course we continue to look for cost efficiencies in the business. So there's multiple levers. The incremental CapEx just being one.","Ali Agha","Okay. But I guess looked another way, Ben, I mean assuming you do get that incremental CapEx. Should we \u2013 we should not expect the 5% to 7% growth rate to change as a result of that. That would just make it easier to perhaps hit the higher end. Is that the way to think about it?","Ben Fowke","I mean we \u2013 as you know, Ali, we always take a look at that, but I mean I think what you just said is a good assumption.","Ali Agha","Okay. And my last question, can you just, I guess, give a little more detail as you mentioned your electric load growth weather normalized with north of 1% this \u2013 in 2018, which you are assuming flat growth in 2019. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on why you're expecting that to slowdown in 2019 versus 2018?","Bob Frenzel","You know, Ali, we had good solid growth in 2018, a lot of it was driven by large C&I demand and some oil and gas growth in our SPS business. We think that year-over-year we have a couple of discrete instances where we know we have a lower demand from some of those C&I customers and we don't expect as aggressive growth in the oil and gas industries we saw in 2018. Obviously, if we had upside as Ben mentioned to the sales growth in some of our expectations, if we exceeded the flat forecast, it would obviously be upside for 2019 earnings.","Ali Agha","I see. And lastly the DRIP program, does that support about a $75 million sort of annual run rate for equity issuance? Is that good for modeling purposes?","Bob Frenzel","Yeah, that's $75 million to $85 million is a good number.","Ali Agha","Got you. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ben Fowke","Good morning.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on the incremental capital plan. You mentioned PPA buyouts are one thing that you're looking at there. What's the next milestone that we might see in that process? And is there anything else that you're looking at there where we could see some kind of information near-term?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think, we've talked about the universe of opportunities and it's going to be obviously case by case. Our corporate development team\u2019s hard at work looking for those opportunities and making sure that the there's a good deal for the buyer and seller and just as importantly our customers. So there aren't really timeframes on that, but we are optimistic that there will be transactions to talk about in the future.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And then on the PSCo CapEx shift to 2019 from 2020. What was behind that? And then when we think about modeling for 2020 and feeding in the 500 megawatts of wind from the Colorado Energy Plan, how should we model that CapEx and rate base, and potentially earnings growth within the 2019 year?","Bob Frenzel","Yeah, Chris, it\u2019s Bob. On the shift, when we filed our CPCN for the Colorado Energy Plan and the wind farm there, we had originally contemplated that being a build-own-transfer where the developer would construct it and transfer it to us at COD. Through the process of the fourth quarter in negotiations with the developer, we opted to step in by the land and development rights and build the project ourselves. So the shift in capital is just a pull forward from that wind farm. So you see an incremental capital in 2019 in Colorado and then probably slightly less capital in 2020 for the same wind farm.","Christopher Turnure","Got you. So net, net between the two years really no total change, just a pull forward of the CapEx and potentially earnings power as well?","Bob Frenzel","That's right. We'd have CapEx pull forward, AFUDC pull forward and slight interest expense pull forward, but in total in aggregate across the two years the same amount.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, got you. And then, I guess, just kind of summarize that and the impact on 2019 that looks like a positive since you introduced guidance at third quarter earnings, you also have the Mankato project, you had wind repowering elsewhere, flat load growth assumption for the year and maybe a little bit of weather benefit at least to kickoff the year here in the first 30 days or so. Is that kind of the correct way to think about the puts and takes around guidance since you originally put it out there?","Ben Fowke","Yeah, you certainly talked about some of the upside levers actually across the entirety of the system for the month. We'll see how it comes in. The upper Midwest is certainly very cold, but the rest of our jurisdiction had been relatively benign in January.","Bob Frenzel","It\u2019s going to be 40 degrees here on Sunday, so \u2013 and that\u2019s above, not below.","Ben Fowke","But, yeah, I think you hit some of the positive sensitivities for the year.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Ben Fowke","Hi, Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you.","Bob Frenzel","Good morning.","Travis Miller","Just a bit of a higher level strategy question, but I was wondering if you could give your take on the idea of the SPP transmission area westward expansion, your thoughts there.","Ben Fowke","I'm not quite sure what your question is. David, do you have? No.","Travis Miller","I guess the Mountain West Transmission Group, just discussions\u2026","Ben Fowke","Oh, you're talking more about Colorado now, aren't you?","Travis Miller","Yeah, it'd be Colorado and I believe Texas, part of your western Texas would be involved.","Ben Fowke","So, you probably know, Travis, that we looked at joining Mountain West. And at the end of the day, the cost benefit analysis really didn't pencil out for the benefit of our customers the way we were hoping it would. It doesn't mean we're not open to looking at those things in the future, but the math didn't work for us at least in this round.","Travis Miller","Okay. Would renewables be involved in that? Is that a big part of that\u2026","Ben Fowke","Well, it\u2019s certainly something we were looking at \u2013 I'm sorry, Travis. You go ahead. I cut you off.","Travis Miller","No, just if \u2013 you\u2019re saying that \u2013 you heard that correctly. The renewables for SPP in general, is that part of the idea there?","Ben Fowke","Yeah, I mean, the advantage of joining Mountain West would be potentially a larger footprint, which is good for renewable integration. Certainly, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that with MISO and other regions. But again, their cost and other trade offs, when we added up the pros and the cons, we thought it was not enough of a benefit for our customers to move forward with it. Again, these things need to be periodically revisited and that's what we'll do.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. And then there\u2019s another higher level question. When you think about Minnesota and the programs you have there, you\u2019ve talked about the Renewable Connect and EV pilot, and obviously the renewables on the system. What's your view in terms of how that state looks in your system in say three to five years as you get through the later part of your capital spending in and even operating spending potentially?","Ben Fowke","It's absolutely amazing how quickly renewables. I think it's by 2022, if not 2021, renewables will be the biggest source of energy across all of our eight states and that includes the upper Midwest and Minnesota. And I believe around the mid 20s, we crossed the line and renewables will be 50% of our energy mix. So it's absolutely phenomenal. And Travis, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is also affordable. It's creating a brand for the state, which I think is helping to attract economic development. We're really excited about Google. I don't think that will be the last data center that we\u2019re able to obtain. And I do think what we're doing with leading the clean energy transition can become a strategic asset for the state and our other states as well.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. I appreciate it.","Ben Fowke","Thank you, Travis.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ben Fowke","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Hey, guys. Actually, you guys answered all my questions from prior analyst, so I'll give you the time back. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Bob Frenzel","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So I have a really big picture question. So, I'm looking at the slide from your EEI deck with the PPA roll off. And I heard you mentioned the potential early buyouts of some of the PPAs. And now given what we're witnessing in California now with this whole discussion about how expensive renewable power PPAs has inflated customer bills.","I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense, for instance, if there is any kind of a rule of thumb, what kind of CapEx opportunity do you see as these PPAs roll off. And just before I let you answer it, I'm just wondering if \u2013 is it a same type of rule of thumb that we have for O&M savings that some of the utilities mentioned that for instance, $1 of O&M allow us to spend anywhere between $6 and $7 of CapEx. Is the same rule of thumb applicable to those expiring PPAs? Thanks.","Bob Frenzel","Well, I mean, the CapEx rule of thumb would hold true to that if you're buying out a PPA and putting in a rate base, that's a good rule of thumb. We've got a large universe of power purchase agreements. There is a slide that you\u2019re probably looking at from the EEI deck. I don't have it in front of me now. But we anticipate about 4,000 megawatts of those PPAs would \u2013 half of it in renewables and wind, I believe, and the other half in fossil fuels. It might be something that we could look at. Now whether or not we can pull the transaction again that \u2013 you got to \u2013 it has to work for us, it has to work for the seller and it has to work for customers. And we've had some success with that and we anticipate future success.","But either way, Angie, when these PPAs roll off, most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping bills low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about. So, it's really kind of a version of steel for fuel, if you will. So, we don't have quite the same high price type PPAs that I think PGE might have. But the reality is energy prices have fallen over the last 10 years. So as things we did 10 years ago roll off, it's going to create opportunities either for buying or at the very least keeping bills low for customers, all of which is good.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. But I'm just going back to that slide, and again, I know you're not seeing it right now hence I'm looking at it. So is it as simple as, I'm just basically looking at the expiration of those PPAs and I see that you guys are showing us rough pricing of those PPAs. And so basically in the absence of that expense, I'm multiplying that benefit by say six and seven times and that's the incremental CapEx I can spend.","Ben Fowke","Bob, I don't think we quite will look at it that way.","Bob Frenzel","When we think about the impact on customer bills and the headroom of that higher-priced PPAs rolling off create its factors into how we think about our capital investment program. As Ben says, we could invest in grid like infrastructure to a significant degree and we talk about what replacement costs in the same deck. We talk a little bit about what replacement costs for the grid would look like. We're throttled by that usually at the pace of what we think that our customers would or should afford as we increase the capital plan. So, fuel and purchase power reductions enable the company to invest in capital to the benefit of our customers while keeping bills low. So I don't know if we're using a specific multiplier there, Angie, but your thesis is correct.","Ben Fowke","Angie, I think the way you have to look \u2013 I think \u2013 and maybe we could take some of this offline, but I think the way you have to look at it is if it has a positive NPV for the customer, we would \u2013 and we can negotiate the transaction with that in mind. Then the opportunity is to put that CapEx. And you can probably do the math on 2000 megs of wind and 2000 megs of fossil, where that would roughly be. Then you'd be putting that in rate base and you'd get the earnings power off of it. That's the universe I think is of how we would look at it.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, I understand. Just one up. So can you give us a sense of you're running into any issues with finding good sites for future wind farms and if you're close to reaching a point where solar is becoming a cost competitive or attractive versus incremental winds?","Ben Fowke","I mean we \u2013 there are sites out there and we've had I think pretty good success in finding sites and I think the results speak for themselves there and those sites will continue to be available. As far as solar becoming more competitive, you're absolutely right. And I think the \u2013 my thought Angie is solar is going to continue to see significant cost reductions more than offsetting, in my opinion, the fall off of the ITC. And I think that marries up really nicely with the actual coal plant retirements that we're looking at because as you know solar has far higher planning capacity than wind does. Wind is more like fuel. Solar is kind of a mixture of the two. So I think the stars are aligning very well for us in that regard.","Angie Storozynski","Great, thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ben Fowke","Hey, Jon.","Jonathan Arnold","Well, good morning guys.","Ben Fowke","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Hello.","Ben Fowke","Can you hear us?","Jonathan Arnold","I can. I can hear you. Can you hear me?","Ben Fowke","Yeah, we can hear you loud and clear.","Jonathan Arnold","Hello. Can you hear me now?","Ben Fowke","We can hear you.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. All right, I was \u2013 we got kicked off the call for a little bit and then came back. So I'm going to apologize if you already answered this one.","Ben Fowke","Must have been bad behavior, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","It's \u2013 something was sensed. So O&M, you're targeting flat to 2017 levels, which means getting sort of back down to just under $2.3 billion as I read the face of the numbers. So \u2013 and you've been saying for awhile that you want to be flat through \u2013 out though 2022 at that kind of 2, 3 level. So you \u2013 is the kind of reduction in 2019 just kind of getting back down to plan, having been a little over in 2018? Or are you \u2013 is it a precursor to may be starting to push for something that's a bit better than flat? Just curious if you can maybe speak to the 2018 number and then that guidance.","Ben Fowke","Jonathan, one of the things to think about is we are adding a significant amount of new wind onto our system in advance of retiring any legacy generation and that new wind causes O&M upward pressures. So I would say that the balance of the base business is we continue to bend the cost curve on the base business while we absorb the incremental O&M from the wind. So as we absorb lots of new generation, we've had some cost pressures in O&M. I think generally keeping it flat is us bending the cost curve except for the new wind adds.","Jonathan Arnold","So is the forecast still like that $2.3 billion numbers out through the program or has that changed a little bit?","Ben Fowke","Yeah, I think that's a good \u2013 that's still a good assumption. That's still our guidance.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. That was it. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","You\u2019re welcome, Jonathan.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Ben Fowke","Paul, how are you?","Paul Patterson","Nice.","Bob Frenzel","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","So just one sort of quick question here. The \u2013 could you follow-up a little bit on the use of securitization as being one of the tools in the toolbox as you guys were indicating? What do you mean by that in terms of just how should we think about if the legislation were to pass, what might happen with that or how you guys might use that? ","Ben Fowke","Well in Colorado and in securitization in general, one there is two things it has to has. It has to be written in a way that technically you can actually do the bond programs off of it. And then, two, one of the things we'd be looking at is things like utility ownership of the generation that's been securitized. If those things come together and remember in Colorado at least it's a voluntary tool than it might be something we look at. But I think the important thing, as I mentioned Paul earlier, is that we've achieved the goals of securitization through our own efforts. And that includes community and employee taking care of both the communities and the employees and keeping our bills flat and that's what we've achieved. So we don't need securitization to keep doing that, but it \u2013 if it's something that makes it even more attainable then we're all for it.","Paul Patterson","Okay. I guess, I'm sort of wondering, I mean, in the case of, like, New Mexico, I can see with PNM what people are sort of thinking about. I'm just sort of, like, is there any particular project or issue that securitization would address that I'm just missing? I apologize for just being dense on this.","Ben Fowke","No, no, no. Again that's why I think it's just that tool in the toolbox. I mean, it's down the road it might be something we would want to look at, but there isn't anything we\u2019re specifically thinking about today.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me. Keep warm.","Ben Fowke","We will. Thank you.","Bob Frenzel","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time. So, Mr. Frenzel, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Bob Frenzel","Well as always thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paul A. Johnson","Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 Year-End Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller.","This morning, we will review our 2013 results and discuss our 2014 priorities, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2014 earnings guidance. Slides of the company today's conference call are available on our web page. In addition, we will post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on our website.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release in our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2013 GAAP earnings of $1.91 per share included a $0.04 per share charge as a result of a 2013 FERC decision regarding fuel cost -- fuel and cost allocations at SPS. These issues relate to complaints by parties dating back to 2004 and 2006. While we are pursuing reconsideration of these orders, they resulted in a refund liability for prior periods. And consequently, we took a $36 million pretax charge during the third quarter of 2013.","2012 GAAP earnings of $1.85 per share included a $0.03 per share tax benefit associated with federal subsidies for prescription drugs planned that were previously expensed. Both items are excluded from ongoing earnings. Management believes ongoing earnings, provides a more meaningful comparison as representative of Xcel Energy's Fundamental core earnings power. As a result, our comments will focus on 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share compared with 2012 ongoing earnings of $1.82 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'm pleased to announce another successful year at Xcel Energy. In addition to delivering on our annual financial objectives, we executed on several initiatives that position Xcel Energy for continued financial and operational success in the years to come.","Let me start by discussing some of our 2013 highlights. Once again, we delivered strong financial results. Ongoing earnings grew over 7% to $1.95 per share. This marks the ninth consecutive year with net books [ph] exceeded our earnings guidance. In the fourth consecutive year, we have delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We also raised our annual dividend $0.04 per share or nearly 4%. We completed rate cases in several jurisdictions, which helped us to achieve our financial objectives in 2013.","Looking back on 2013, we're especially proud of the commitment to customers that our employees demonstrated again and again. A series of severe weather events, including blizzards, high storms, thunderstorms and floods, brought out the company's best efforts. We also completed several major construction projects, including the effort to extend the life of our Monticello nuclear plant, and we placed steam generators at our Prairie Island nuclear plant.","Our Sherco 3 coal fire unit is back in service after sustaining major damage in 2011. We brought Jones 4 online in Texas and in time for higher summer load and to help serve the continued industrial growth we're seeing in the region.","Colorado. We made great progress on the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act projects, including the Cherokee combined-cycle plant and adding SCRs and scrubbers to Ponne, as well as SCRs at Hayden. Overall, these projects remain on time and on budget.","Another major focus in 2013 was our ongoing work to increase the strength and reliability of the electric grid. We're making significant investments to ensure the system is ready to accommodate renewable energy, interact with new technologies and withstand major weather events. Strong energy grid ensures that we're able to meet the growing and changing energy needs of our customers. We are set to increase our future wind production by 40%. And given the current price of wind energy, this is an excellent way to protect our customers from rising fuel costs.","The American Wind Energy Association recognized our efforts to promote wind production when they named us The Utility of the Year. And we obviously the appreciate the designation, but we're particularly satisfied that we've determined how to make wind energy an affordable option for customers. In another effort that leverages our environmental leadership for customer gain, we were able to announce in 2013 that we're on track to exceed our goal of reducing carbon emissions from our power plants, 20% by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. We are well positioned on this run in part because we acted early in converting and refurbishing power plants and because we have such a solid portfolio of renewable energy sources.","With a successful 2013 behind us, we're ready to make 2014 another good year. Our focus will be on ensuring that Xcel Energy is the energy provider that our customers prefer and value. We have initiatives underway to achieve productivity improvements through technology and to leverage employee engagement. We will continue our efforts to strengthen the energy grid, build our portfolio of renewable energy resources and reduce emissions from our plants.","Part of our effort to strengthen the grid, we plan to invest $4.5 billion on transmission projects over the next 5 years. We've proven that we can design, cite and construct transmission for less than our competitors. And we see significant opportunities right in our backyard. We believe forming a Transco will provide multiple benefits, including enabling increased flexibility to support our operations in the post-FERC Order 1000 transmission investment environment. Depending on regulatory treatment, we believe that our planned projects in the Southwest Power Pool fit nicely into a Transco. The necessary regulatory filings will be submitted later this year, and we hope to have approvals by late 2014 or early 2015.","Another key priority for us is to deliver constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings and to improve the overall regulatory construct. In 2014, we hope to put in place multiyear-rate plans in Minnesota, Colorado, North Dakota and potentially other jurisdictions, which will provide revenue certainty for shareholders and cost certainty for our customers. Achievement of our 2014 priorities will allow us to deliver on our objectives and provide an attractive total return to our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. As you can see from our earnings release, we had another strong year. On a consolidated basis, 2013 ongoing earnings grew $0.13 per share or 7% to $1.95. This resulted in a consolidated ROE of 10.5% on an ongoing basis. The improvement in profitability was primarily the result of new interim rates implemented across several jurisdictions, positive weather and lower interest expense. These positive factors were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expenses.","More specifically, I wanted to provide you with some insight into several drivers for the year. First, weather was very favorable in 2013, increasing earnings almost $0.11 per share compared to normal, and $0.06 per share compared to 2012. Sales growth was slightly stronger than expected for 2013. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 0.4%, and firm natural gas sales increased 3.8%. However, sales growth varied by operating company. On a weather-adjusted basis, our electric sales growth by OPCO was: NSP-Wisconsin, 0.8%; PSCo, 1%; SPS, 1.7%; and NSP-Minnesota declined 0.8%.","The economies in our service territories continue to improve. Overall, compared to the national average, we had higher job growth and lower unemployment in our service territory. Finally, at SPS, we sold 2 small segments of transmission lines that were no longer needed to support our customers. As a result, we recognized a $0.02 per share gain on the transaction after sharing with customer.","Next, I will provide some detail on the financial results of each of our operating company. At NSP-Minnesota, ongoing earnings grew 13% to $0.79 per share, primarily due to new rates going into effect in Minnesota and South Dakota, and interim rate in North Dakota. Cooler winter weather and lower interest charges also served to improve 2013 earnings. Even with the benefit of positive weather at NSP-Minnesota, our earned 2013 ROE of 9.2% was well below our authorized level. We have filed a propose multiyear-rate plan in Minnesota in an effort to close this gap.","Earnings at PSCo increased $0.01 per share in 2013. The primary drivers were higher electric and natural gas rates, cooler weather and lower interest charges. These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M and customer refunds related to the 2013 electric earnings test.","Similar to 2012, in Colorado, we over-earned our authorized electric ROE of 10%. As a result, we recognized a refund obligation to customers. After accounting for this refund, as well as the under-earnings in our natural gas business, PSCo earned a consolidated ROE of approximately 9.7% in 2013. At SPS, earnings increased $0.01 per share to $0.23 for the year. The positive impact of an electric rate increase in Texas and the sale of transmission assets to Sharyland were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Our ongoing ROE was 9% at SPS. We continue to make progress on regulatory front, getting writers put in place and the use of a forward test gear in New Mexico.","Texas and New Mexico offers substantial organic growth opportunities due to the continued expansion of the oil and gas industries located within our service territory. As a result, we've identified certain attractive infrastructure investments that will help develop this part of the country. Getting the rules in place to ensure timely recovery, as well as establishing an alternative investment structure that Ben discussed, will be an important part of our future. We've made great progress at SPS and we're excited about the opportunities ahead.","Finally, earnings in NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.02 per share, as a result of higher electric and natural gas rates, cooler winter weather partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation. Our earned ROE at NSP-Wisconsin was 10.6%, slightly higher than our overall authorized level.","I'll now comment on several of our pending regulatory proceedings. Additional details related to these and other proceedings are included in today's press release. As you may recall, last November, we filed a 2-year electric rate case in Minnesota. In December, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved our request to file and granted a $127 million or 4.6% interim rate increase, which went into effect earlier this month. The Commission also agreed that our request to accelerate the theoretical depreciation reserve amortization was permissible. The procedural schedule for the Minnesota case was established this week and is included in the earnings release. Intervenor testimony is due in June, hearings are scheduled for August, the ALJ report is due in December, and a final decision in this case is expected in the first quarter of 2015.","In our North Dakota electric rate case, we reached a comprehensive multiyear settlement agreement with the staff, which includes a 4-year rate plan with 5% annual increases in retail revenues for the first 3 years and no rate increase in the final year. This settlement also includes a gradually-increasing ROE during this multiyear period. Hearings on the settlement were held last week, and a final decision is expected from the North Dakota Commission this quarter.","At SPS, our New Mexico requested $32.5 million rate increase is pending Commission's decision. On January 23, a hearing examiner provided a recommended decision, which included an ROE of 9.73% and a requested equity ratio of 53.9%. The recommendation did not include a revenue requirement calculation, but our initial analysis indicates a reduction to our base rate request of about $6 million, which results in a base rate increase of approximately $15 million. The recommended decision did not address the renewable writer. The Commission's decision is expected in April.","In Texas, we recently filed for a net increase in electric rates of $52.7 million or 5.8%. We have requested the implementation of interim rates of $32.6 million, effective on March 1. Intervenor testimony is due in May and hearings are planned for June. We anticipate a final decision and the implementation of final rates in the third quarter.","Turning to our financing plans. Today's press release summarizes our 5-year financing plans related to our $14 billion capital expenditure forecast. We plan to issue the following post-mortgage bonds during the first half of the year: approximately $300 million of both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo; approximately $150 million at SPS; and approximately $100 million at NSP-Wisconsin. We also have plans to issue equity during the next 5 years. While we don't plan to provide you with the specific timing of the equity issuance, I will point out that our CapEx program is front-end loaded, and we anticipate our equity issuance will likely be similar.","With that, I will wrap up. Once again, we delivered 2013 earnings at the upper end of our guidance range. We're proud of our track record of generating the financial results that our investors expect. Operationally, we continue to provide our customers with a high level of service, even when faced with several severe weather events. We continue to make important investments in our system that position our company for long-term operational success, and will allow us to provide strong customer value for many decades to come. We are positioned to continue to deliver attractive shareholder returns well into the future.","In summary, we're proud of our 2013 achievements and look forward to updating you on future successes in 2014. This morning, we are reaffirming our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. Please note, we've updated certain guidance assumptions to reflect 2013 actual results. Details of these changes can be found in today's press release.","In particular, we have revised our depreciation assumption to reflect our proposed moderation plan in the Minnesota rate case. When we originally issued our guidance assumptions in the third quarter, it was prior to our filing of the Minnesota rate case. So we reflected a total then-expected increase in depreciation expense. The moderation plan, if approved, would reduce both revenue and depreciation expense by approximately $81 million, but wouldn't impact earnings per share. Therefore, this assumption change doesn't impact our guidance outlook.","So with that, Calvin, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm just trying to better understand the change in the depreciation guidance. If you look at your Slide 7, it looks like you take the impact of a customer bill of $127 million, which I think is the interim rate relief, add the $81 million and the $16 million to get to a pretax impact on operating income of $224 million. So it looks from the slide, as if the $81 million is incremental to the $127 million, but that's -- but you said the opposite, I think, in terms of how we should think about it.","Teresa S. Madden","Well, if you start at the top of the $274 million, that's the growth request. And then we took out the $81 million, so that gets us to $193 million. So we've lowered the revenue, that's doing that, but the bottom depreciation expense were also. So we come to a net kind of cash more impact on the customer bill with a couple of those other items. But then, we also lowered depreciation expense. So we're basically lowering revenue and we're lowering depreciation expense, which gets us to that new -- that net $224 million.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But -- okay. So for modeling purposes, because your drivers don't give the amount of rate relief, we should add -- or we can make an assumption of $127 million interim increase or whatever you think you're going to get in the case plus the $80 million, right?","Teresa S. Madden","Exactly.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second question I have is there looks like there is a liability that's set up for a customer refund against the Sharyland gain of $7.6 million. Over what time period is that money refunded?","Teresa S. Madden","It's not determined. But it'll probably be likely in the next year or so. It -- they have just been -- we just reached those agreements with the Texas and New Mexico.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question for me is, what's the approximate timing of your next Colorado electric rate filing?","Teresa S. Madden","We probably anticipate mid-year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the interest expense. Obviously, you did some issues in 2013 that were very favorable relative to what you redeemed, and you've got what you mentioned in terms of first half financing. What are your thoughts on how interest rate -- interest expense develops here in 2014?","Teresa S. Madden","In terms of -- well, we had some replacements. And particularly, we no longer have any more 8% debt. That was all basically retired in 2013. So we would expect with our new financings that we would be pretty comparable. We wouldn't expect to see such a significant decline as we did between '12 and '13.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's because you've also got the incremental financing?","Teresa S. Madden","We do have the incremental. But net-net, it's still is beneficial.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And the second, on the weather impact, could you break that down in terms of the revenue benefit and then with the higher cost related to the weather was in 2013?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, the higher cost, that would be difficult. I can tell you in terms of the company that, that would help you how the weather benefit went.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sure. Yes, you put the EPS obviously in there. I just wondered how that breaks down.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Travis, this is Ben. The higher cost directly attributable would be the storms that we had that you could generally attribute to hotter, more volatile weather. But as we've also done, we also always pick the opportunity when we have weather to put -- a favorable weather -- to put some more money back into maintenance and those sorts of things, so we have a strong system going forward. It's a little bit harder to quantify.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of A. Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One is, on loan growth, I see that you folks -- weather normalized, as I'm assuming 0.4% or so in '14. However, fourth quarter was up 1.1%, and I know it's just a quarter, but are you seeing a pickup in load growth? Is that a sign of optimism there? Can you just elaborate a bit on that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Ali, I'll start it off and then Teresa can add. I mean, I -- we did see a pickup in the quarter. But I think you have to -- we're always pretty cautious about a quarter, particular a quarter that's experienced some pretty volatile weather. Not only in total, but how it occurred within the month. And so you have to be a little bit careful. However, it is a favorable trend. I step back and compare the quarter to the overall year, and I think what we're seeing -- we'll continue to see SPS and PSCo do better than the North, and that we don't anticipate that trend will change into '14. You break it out a little bit further. Residential, generally, usage-wise, it would be flat -- PSCo's flat with usage. Every other jurisdiction's declining in usage. However, we're seeing customer additions again, consistent with where we were prerecession, so that's a good sign. But you put it all together and it still results in fairly flat residential revenues. And then on the C&I side, again, much more activity in the South and the West, and not so much in the North.","Teresa S. Madden","I think you covered that well, Ben. And I would agree, one quarter is probably not a trend.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the weather, I know we're early in the year. But any sense of how much cushion, if you will, this very cold January has given you guys as you're looking into '14 right now?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, Ali, I would say that Minnesota's been really cold. But Colorado's had some really warm days, too. So anybody watch the Bronco game.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","So we've been following the New York forecasts, too. I would agree with Teresa, it's been incredibly cold in Minnesota but pretty generally tempered in Colorado. And so you get the benefit, as we've always talked about, with a big portfolio of diversity. And weather is part of that diversity and sort of was a bit canceling each other out, to Teresa's point.","Teresa S. Madden","Right. Maybe it was slightly up, but it's not as much as everyone in Minnesota would think.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Our misery indicated here would...","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right, right. We've been hearing about the Minnesota weather. But last year you had $0.11 of benefit versus normal. Just thinking, again, given what you're seeing so far, are you comfortable that you can match that so that weather doesn't become a headwind for you this year?","Teresa S. Madden","I mean, in terms of matching it, I mean, it's so early. Things can change in the weather, and I just wouldn't -- I think it's too early.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","If you notice -- I mean, our guidance, as you know, assumes normal weather, and that's what you have to count on. A little bit of positive in the first month. But the summer, it weighs on as much heavily than the winter, generally. So we just have to see how that plays out. We can't count on $0.11, that's for sure.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right, right, right. And last question, Ben and Teresa. Remind us again, as you're looking at this Transco potential on the SPP region, et cetera, was that baked into your long-term earnings, growth guidance, the 4% to 6%? Does it move the middle further? Is it already in that? Can you just remind us how that fits into your outlook?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean, Ali -- I mean, it will allow us to continue to potentially invest in transmission. And that it's depending on how the rules actually play out in a FERC 1000 world, but this is -- the book of business that we talked about at analyst day is really based upon what we have today. So we're just putting these things in place. So several years down the road, we can continue to be as successful in building transmission as we already are. And it's, as I said and Teresa has said, it's another arrow on our quiver, and we need to have options because the future is always uncertain.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Well, it doesn't cause you to go above 6% or so. It still keeps you in that 4% to 6% range as you look at it today?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean -- I think, today, that would be the case rate.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","As I look at the capital expenditure forecast you've laid out that underlies the 4% to 6% average earnings for that expiration, I observed that it is somewhat front-end loaded. A lot of that capital spend happens in the first couple of years and then there is sort of a dramatic drop towards the back end. If you were to fully execute on all of those, all that spending in the first 2 years, even with the financing costs, the equity, as long as you're successful in your regulatory strategy, why wouldn't it be possible for you to earn towards the high end of the guidance range over the next few years?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Why wouldn't it be possible, is that what you just asked?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I mean, because you've got more capital, more rate base growth on the front end of the plan than the back end.","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I would just say in terms of exceeding it, we do have assumptions around rate cases. There still continues to be some regulatory lag in some of our jurisdictions, but we expect to see it be in our 4% to 6% growth range.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then what makes you comfortable that the regulatory strategy you've implemented in Minnesota is going to drive a better outcome than the last case? I mean, so far, what could you point to in terms of your dialogue with your -- with the important counterparties in that case that gives you comfort you'll be able to get most of what you're asking for this time around?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, there's a lot of subjective and qualitative. But I think I'd point to the fact that interim rates were approved and without a lot of controversy. I think we're hearing qualitatively, that the quality of the data submission was very strong. The outreach efforts, the rate mitigation plan, I think, has been understood and, I would say, generally accepted by our stakeholders. They understand what we're doing. And remember, Greg, we -- while this, we're not asking for a 5-year plan. We've been talking to stakeholders what a 5-year plan looks like. And they understand that it's -- the pace of our rate increases that we've asked for, as we did things like extend the life of our nuclear plants for 20 years, it's going to start to level off. And so they understand that this isn't going to be a trend forever.","Teresa S. Madden","I would just add to that. I mean, the way we think about 2013, there were 3 significant things in that case that were in isolation, which we believe have been resolved. I mean, starting with the Monticello plant and the upgrade, the upgrade is complete. The plant has been operating since then. The Sherco plant, we had a catastrophic failure, that refurbishment is also complete. And then we had the sales forecast request in terms of the -- actually, decline, I should say. And we feel that we have much better forecasting that we'll do better on in this case. So I think that those 3 things are behind us, and so we feel better about this case going forward.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I'll just add, Greg. As we talked on investors\u2019 day, we're offering great predictability moderation, we have addressed the issues upfront and investments actually reflect a carbon-free generation, which has been a preference of our customer. So that's why I think this case is different.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just with respect to Sharyland, I noticed this is an ongoing earnings, is there any other opportunity that you guys are seeing with that in terms of monetizing any other potential transmission assets?","Teresa S. Madden","In terms of divestiture?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yes.","Teresa S. Madden","No, not really. That was a very unique circumstance in terms of Sharyland and Caprock, who used to be a wholesale customer. And we just -- the transmission line, we didn't need it any longer. So...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I was wondering if you could tell me, with respect to the FERC Order 1000 and the right of first refusal, if you see any potential impact associated with competition, with respect to, perhaps, CapEx, or return or anything. I mean, how do you see that shaking out? Do you see opportunities outside? And do you see potentially competitive threats within your jurisdiction? Do you follow me?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. I mean, we have right of first refusals, for example, in Minnesota. But to your point, I think it's pretty clear FERC doesn't particularly care for those rights of first refusal. So we're not sure how that's going to play out. Right now, we don't see any immediate threat. But when you get out in the latter part of the decade, potentially, you could see the threat. And that's why, Paul, we want the Transco, because it allows us to compete on an even-keeled basis. It doesn't mean that, that threat will ever emerge. You can make a similar argument down in SPP in Texas and New Mexico. You also asked about ROE's. I mean, I think everybody knows that there are a number of pending cases in front of FERC to lower ROEs. That remains to be seen. Our FERC recoveries right now are not dependent upon -- or rather, our transmission recoveries now aren't really dependent upon FERC ROEs, but we'll have follow that. My personal opinion, I think you'll see some gap closure between a FERC ROE and what a typical state ROE is. But hopefully, not too much, because I think there's -- ROEs, hopefully, will improve at the state level. So hopefully, maybe FERC goes down a little bit and the state goes up. But we're prepared. And that's what the Transco does for us. We're prepared for different scenarios.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I guess I was sort of really actually thinking about what you said to the return, and cost to capital was really actually on the competitive side. I mean, in other words, if FERC opens this all up to competition, do you see, I don't know, private equity investors or something like that coming in and perhaps using a variety of means to potentially come up with different return outlook? And I was wondering if that's something you have. I mean, I know it's early and what-have-you, but I was just wondering if you're hearing anything about that or...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I don't. I'm not really hearing probably any more than anybody else, but I think you raised a good point. And -- I mean, infrastructure funds would love to invest in transmission. But a couple of things about that. If you look at the rules to the extent they're out now and how competitive bidding would look, your track record, your performance, your operational standing, those are going to be very, very important criteria on who wins those bids. So maybe what you're suggesting, Paul, is that in a Transco or a partnering-type arrangement, could you have more passive partners along with a more active partner? Yes. I mean, that could happen. And again, that's a scenario that I think we're preparing for.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just, finally, sort of a housekeeping thing. I noticed that it looked on Page 7, that residential sales were helped by weather considerably, yet there's sort of a slight hurt to weather for industrial and commercial. Is that because of where those customers are, and there were different weather impacts for different customer classes simply on location? Or is there something else going on sort of a small item? I was just wondering if it was a little unusual.","Teresa S. Madden","I don't think there's anything specific going on in across the jurisdictions. I will say, the weather normalization is more art than science. And when we do have extremes, and it's been said, particularly in a month, it would be really cold in the front part and warmer, that they're not perfect.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","And keep in mind that our larger industrials aren't -- or generally, their weather doesn't do much for them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Julien here. So a quick question actually following up on the last year on the Transco front. Just really quickly, how has your thinking evolved about, A, the usage of partners as you just alluded to? And then, B, how would you structure this as it relates to FERC versus state level of returns and utility structures, if you will?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Julien, I guess I just have to repeat that we're not proposing any kind of structure at this point. We just want to have the Transco option in our back pocket so that we can react to how the market may evolve. And I -- we'll see how it evolves. In the meantime, we're going to focus on state recovered-type transmission, make sure that we improve the returns. You're going to see us continue to try to advance the regulatory construct in that regard, as with when we filed in Texas. And it really relates to revenue crediting and some -- I don't know if they're technical, but some real rate-type issues. And if we get that, a lot of our transmission spend in Texas and New Mexico will be recovered essentially outside of state retail mechanisms. So we don't -- we're really not thinking at this point that we're going to do a Transco into bringing passive partners, et cetera. But, I mean, Paul had asked earlier, is that a possibility? And sure, I see the market evolving that way. And we just want to be ready for it if it goes that way. And again, meantime, we've got great defined developing projects that are real, that we're going to get good recovery on in all of our jurisdictions, primarily at the state level right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. Excellent. And then looking at Colorado, I'd just be curious, as you think about your normalized sales growth numbers, obviously, there's been some commotion around a seller in that meeting. How does that impact your thinking on growth in the state? I mean, is it, at this point, immaterial to think about that? Or does it have any kind of...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","It's not immaterial. I mean, Teresa, you and I were just talking about this a couple of days ago. What do we estimate? Like there's that 0.2 percentage point that it shaves off our growth opportunity?","Teresa S. Madden","Right. Yes, it's not substantial. But if you -- for longer term, it will grow. But it's still not substantial.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I mean -- and that 0.2, that's for next year, you're saying, in Colorado?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, that's roughly. It's taking what we've seen and what we anticipate and what that would do. But it's already baked into the forecast. So that's -- so you should be aware of that. The issue with net metering is getting the rules right, so that the policy is sustainable for the long run. Today, it's not all that noticeable. But if the aspirations of the rooftop solar industry are met, it would be extremely noticeable to customers that don't have a rooftop. And so that's what the whole industry is rallying around and understanding that we have to get the right rules in place so that the technology can compete on an equal basis and not disadvantage one customer for the benefit of another.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And should we read on the utility scale side? Or anything into this way, just RFP around the Black Dog and putting forward a solar project in Minnesota? I mean, is that something that, frankly, at this point, you're going to -- you would pursue a separate RFP on the renewable side if they can do it? Or how are you thinking about that right now?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, we've got a statue that we have to meet, and we take that seriously. And it's 1.5% by 2020, most of which would -- or at least 10% carved out for rooftop, the rest based upon our recommendations, essentially. So we understand that there's going to be solar in Minnesota, and we support that. But we think there's better ways to acquire it. And that's what our contention is. We think that we can do better for our customers if we did a separate RFP.","Teresa S. Madden","Right. Yes, we still believe that the Black Dog is the right, based on the current updated, 300-megawatt load is the right approach. And we just filed for reconsideration to that ALJ recommendation. So...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, and I think others -- the department, for example, thunders. It agrees with us. I mean, that there's a number of technical things that went behind the ALJ's decision. What they were looking at were actual load needs versus where we are today, what they were, how they were valuing solar as far as some societal benefits, et cetera. A number of things. Bottom line is, we haven't removed Black Dog from our CapEx. I mean, it's $100 million, it's fairly small. But it's because we think that this thing will get sorted out.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then quickly on the wind side. I believe, last time you guys discussed the MISO interconnection study that was still pending for one of your new self-builds. Where does that stand?","Teresa S. Madden","We're still waiting for the results, but we're confident. We're, I should say, optimistic that it will come in where we expect it to come in.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think it does come in mid-year...","Teresa S. Madden","Yes. Well, first quarter-ish, yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. From what we're hearing, we're more optimistic today than we were yesterday, put it that way.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi","Actually, I'm all set, but thank you very much.","Teresa S. Madden","Well, with that, thank you for all participating in our year-end earnings call this morning. Please contact us, Paul Johnson and the IR team, with any follow-up questions.

Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson","Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our first quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2013 guidance.","There are slides that accompany today's call which are available on our web page. We will also post a brief video of Teresa summarizing our financial results on the website. As a reminder, some of the comments during this morning's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported first quarter earnings of $0.48 per share compared with $0.38 per share in 2012. First quarter results reflect colder than normal weather, increased electric and gas margins from various rate cases and lower interest expense. Teresa will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance in greater detail in a few moments.","Our first quarter results are a good start to 2013. However, there are challenges ahead. I'll now provide you with a few updates beginning with a review of some key regulatory developments. As you know, it is important to receive timely constructive recovery of the substantial investments we make in our utility business. That said, we were disappointed with the surrebuttal testimony filed by various parties in our Minnesota electric rate case. While we understand this case has some unique circumstances, for example, around our Serco Plant, we thought we provide a good support for our cause, as well as rate making alternatives that balance the interest of various parties. Clearly, the recommended level of recovery is not commensurate with over $5 billion of investment that is planned over the next 5 years. We will work with parties to narrow issues where we can and we will ask the commission to resolve our differences in a way that allows us to continue providing high-quality service to our customers over the long run. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can achieve a constructive outcome in this case. Our earnings guidance assumes constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings. We do not consider the current recommendations from the interveners to be constructive. And should the commission approves a rate increase at these levels, our ability to deliver earnings within our 2013 guidance range would be much more challenging. Looking ahead, initial briefs are due May 15, the ALJ Report is due July 3, and we continue to anticipate a Minnesota PUC decision in September.","We also received disappointing recommendations from interveners in our proposed multiyear natural gas rate case in Colorado. Notably, the staff recommended a rate reduction of $14.4 million based on a historic test year, an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 52%. The office of consumer council recommended a rate increase of $0.5 million based on a historic test year and ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 51%. Earlier this week, we filed rebuttal testimony and reduced our requested increase from $70 million to $65 million over 3 years which largely reflects lower than requested ROE to 10.3%. This initial wide range between the bid and ask on this case is not unusual in Colorado. We continue to work towards a constructive outcome either through settlement or through the normal proceedings. Looking ahead, the case will be heard by the ALJ later this month. On a positive note, I'm pleased that we've already reached settlements in our Texas and South Dakota rate cases. In Texas, our settlement agreement, which is pending commission approval calls for a $37 million annual increase effective in May and a step increase of approximately $14 million in September of this year. It also allows us to implement interim rates for our next transmission cost recovery rider in January of 2014 accelerating recovery by several months. Every settlement is a compromise and this one's no different. While the agreed-upon rate increase falls short of our requested amount, we believe we're making continued progress in Texas. In addition to the interim rates agreed on, one of the other positives of this settlement is that both sides are very interested in achieving constructive rate making outcomes and are interested in discussing alternatives such as a multiyear rate plan prior to our next filing. The commission will act on the settlement later this year.","In South Dakota, we had requested a $19.4 million electric rate increase. In April, the commission approved the settlement agreement which we reached with staff. New rates include an $11.6 million base rate increase plus the implementation of a new rider to recover an additional $3.7 million that began on May 1. Similar to Texas, this settlement is a compromise, which represents a step in the right direction to improving earn return in the north -- rather South Dakota. However, we are making -- while we're making progress, however, we're not earning an acceptable return in South Dakota and need to continue to take steps to improve this jurisdiction's returns. We will continue to work with regulators then legislators to improve the earned ROE.","Turning to our resource plans, we recently issued RFP in both Minnesota and Colorado. In Minnesota, we're seeking potential additions of up to 200 megawatts of wind generation. This could be in the form of a PPA or an ownership option. Since we are ahead of the renewable portfolio standard in Minnesota, we will only add incremental wind generation if it is at an attractive price point for our customers. There's also an RFP for 500 megawatts of thermal generation in Minnesota, which could also either be a PPA or a self build option introduced later in May and Part of this RFP, we have proposed to build up the 3 combustion turbines to meet our customer needs. We have requested that these investments include wider recovery with a sharing mechanism. Other independent parties have also did projects instead of process. Regulators in Minnesota and North Dakota will review our proposal and proposals from other party to determine which offering presents the best deal for customers. We expect a decision later this year. In Colorado, we also have an RFP for 250 megawatts of generation, which could also either be a PPA or self build option. Introduced later in May and we expect a commission decision later this year. It remains to be seen whether and ownership bid will be the best option for our customers. However, it is important to note that an ownership option would be incremental to our capital forecast.","Let me touch on a few other highlights of the quarter. Once again, Xcel Energy was recognized as the #1 Wind Provider by WEA. This is our ninth year in which we have earned this distinction. This underscores our proactive approach to environmental leadership. In Texas, we are nearing completion of the Jones 4 combustion turbine. This additional capacity is needed to meet growth at SPS. This project is coming in on time and under budget. We also continue to make good progress in our transmission investments. One of our key projects is the CapEx 2020 plan. Since February, Xcel Energy and 4 other utilities started construction on the estimated 500 million, 150-mile Hampton Rochester Lacrosse 345 KB project. This line will enhance system reliability and allow for future growth and economic development. At SPS, the final segment of the Texas North transmission portfolio projects was placed into service in March. Work began in 2008 on this $150 million multiproject portfolio to service new load into Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle areas. This project also maintain area service reliability and meet our compliance.","Also at SPS, I think it's important to highlight our transmission construction and renewal efforts paid off during the Texas Panhandle blizzard. In February, a portion of our service territory, the stretch from west of Lobbock to Farrington received over 2 feet of snow and experienced 65 to 75 mile per hour winds. During the storm, we experienced only 2 momentary outages and no sustained outages on our transmission system. Over the past 5 years, we've replaced 5200 cross arms, 820 poles the area covered by the blizzard and we rebuilt 100 miles of transmission lines. These efforts were credited for our system resiliency during the blizzard. I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our transmission employees for jobs well done.","Our storm restoration capabilities were put through another test earlier this month in South Dakota. On April 9, the worst ice storm in decades hit Southeastern South Dakota. Sioux Falls, a city of 150,000 in County was especially hard hit but almost 90,000 outages. By April 11, we had more than tenfold increase over normal staff in place to complete the restoration. Shortly thereafter, Xcel Energy was recognized by the county for the extraordinary efforts of its employees to restore power and in keeping citizens safe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I will discuss first quarter results, our 2013 financing plan and our 2013 earnings guidance. I'll begin with a review of first quarter results. As you might recall, last year, we experienced a very warm first quarter which reduced our earnings by about $0.05 per share. This year we experienced slightly colder than normal temperatures across most of our service territory. As a result, first quarter earnings benefited from a $0.06 per share improvement in weather. For the quarter, earnings at PSCo increased by $0.05 per share, primarily due to the multiyear electric rate increase, as well as higher electric and gas sales due to cooler winter weather. At NSP in Minnesota, earnings increased by $0.05 per share due to interim rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota and an electric rate increase in South Dakota. Orders and results also benefited from cooler weather and lower interest charges as a result of a 2012  debt refinancing.","Earnings at NSP Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share due to new electric and gas rates implemented in Colorado -- or in January and cooler weather. Earnings at SPS were flat for the quarter.","Let's now take a look at the drivers that affected various lines at the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Our first quarter electric margin increased $94 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were: $75 million from retail rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin and South Dakota as well as interim rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota and $22 million from cooler weather. These positive items were partially offset by smaller negative factors including the 2012 leap day impact. Weather normalized retail electric sales decreased 0.6%. However, the comparable period a year ago included the benefit of an extra day of sales due to the leap day. Adjusting for leap day, weather normalized retail electric sales increased 0.5%, which is consistent with our 2013 forecast. Higher electric sales were driven by 1.3% increases in both PSCo and SPS, partially offset by 0.5% sales decline in Minnesota. Natural gas margins increased $28 million in the first quarter, primarily due to cooler weather.","Turning to expenses, first quarter O&M expense increased $18.5 million or 3.6%. The primary drivers of this increase were higher employee benefit costs, nuclear outage amortization and nuclear plant operation costs. We continue to forecast that our 2013 expenses will increase in the 4% to 5% range for the year. Depreciation and amortization increased $20 million or 8.8% with normal system expansion and additional rate case. Other taxes increased approximately $7.8 million or 7.4%, largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. This is a significant driver in our Minnesota electric rate case as approximately $40 million of our rate requested to cover -- recover higher property taxes. Higher property taxes in Colorado related to our electric Retail businesses are -- as part of the multiyear settlement approved by the Colorado Commission in 2012. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 33.4% compared to 29.1% during the comparable period a year ago. Recall that last year, we recognized a discrete tax benefit during the first quarter which lowered our overall effective rate for that period. For the year, we continue to forecast our 2013 effective tax rate will be in the range from 34% to 36%.","During the first quarter, we completed 2 financings. In March we issued $500 million of first mortgage bonds at PSCo and 2 tranches of $250 million each, a 10 year tranche with price at 2.5% and a 30-year tranche was at 3.95%. Also in March, we announced an At-The-Market or ATM equity program of up to $400 million. During March, we sold 7.7 million shares of common stock resulting in a net proceed of $223 million. As you recall, our 5-year CapEx forecast requires $400 million of external equity financing. Completing a portion of our planned equity financing in March allowed us to call the $400 million of 7.6% junior subordinated notes or hybrid security that we issued in 2008. This transaction lowers our overall cost of capital and simplifies our capital structure. Financing plans for the remainder of 2013 include plans to issue $400 million of First Mortgage Bonds at Minnesota and $100 million of first mortgage bonds at SPS. In addition, we also plan to issue $400 million of unsecured debt at the holding company during the second quarter. The financing plans are subject to change based on a variety of factors, including changes of our capital investment plan and financial market condition.","Before we take your questions, I'll comment on our 2013 earnings guidance.","This first quarter results, finally financing and resolution several rate cases have positioned us well to once again meet our annual financial objectives. So while we continue to forecast 2013 EPS to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95, we highlight the importance of meeting constructive outcomes in our pending rate cases in order to meet this objective. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Your O&M came in at 3.6%, as you said, versus the 4% to 5% guidance. Are you tracking at the lower end or even below this guidance for this year? And how should we think about O&M growth rates after 2013?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, I mean, we are still anticipating to be in the 4% to 5%. We just have some timing that's why we're a little bit lower. But when we look to the longer term, I would say we would look to may be more a 3% to 4%. In product test, 4% to 5% is occurring because we only increased from '11 to '12, 1.7%. So '12 is a little bit low because it's part of our management initiatives and other things so I would look in the long term, the more 3% to 4% and on track to 4% to 5%.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on interest you mentioned the remarkably low interest rates that you've done from debt out here in the first quarter. Given the low interest environment, could there be upside to the $30 million of interest reductions that you outlined for 2013?","Teresa S. Madden","That's consistent with that. We even assume the lower one.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you provide a little more color on the RFPs? Can you confirm that self build options are available for you for both of them? And any color in terms of the number of bidders if that information is in the public.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Neil, this is Ben. Self build options are available for both. We've seen I think some, I would say wide variety of bidders and opportunities and really just in the preliminary stages of evaluating both the wind and the fossil bids.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, but we don't know the exact numbers out there yet?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","No. We're not disclosing that at this point.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could characterize, in Minnesota, I wonder if you could characterize a change in the interveners testimony especially on the ROE from 10.2% to 9.8%, what were some of the drivers there and how does that relate to potentially changing your requested ROE?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, Travis, let me take the first part of your question. And I think that was around ROE. I think that's just typically they do update their ROE recommendation and analysis. And they looked -- it's a formulaic approach and frankly, the whole industry has seen some pretty significant stock appreciation in the last 4 months and when you run that through some of the models that does yield a lower ROE and that's was we saw there, it's very formulaic. And did you have a second part to your question?","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was just going to say would that effect, you changing your 10.6% to a lower number.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","We filed our surrebuttal testimony and I guess we're just where we are now in the group. I don't know if you want to...","Teresa S. Madden","That's correct. We've left it at the same level so we have not revised our request at this point -- our requested 10.6%.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Typically, Travis, typically the recommendation on ROE plays a very -- is listened to very closely by the commission.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Real quick housekeeping. You mentioned that you recognize a liability for that change, the difference when you're expected and interim -- can you just give me what that number was?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I'll let Teresa take that.","Teresa S. Madden","I think, I would just say, we're assuming that we're going to have a reasonable regulatory outcome and we went through and looked at all the positions as we do in terms of establishing our guidance and we recognize that amount that we thought was reasonable.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What was that amount?","Teresa S. Madden","We're not going to give you the specific amount but we would assume it's a reasonable outcome.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Travis, I mean, we typically -- I mean, we actually did it a little bit earlier than we normally would where we would recognize any kind of refund based upon where we are. But given where we are, it's -- what we're assuming in the accrual that, we're not going to disclose a number, but that -- we're not, it's going to be less than our interim rates but still what we would consider a constructive level so hopefully that helps you frame it a bit.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Actually, Travis asked my question. I guess, the only other question I have -- so just on the equity, so you did, was it, $227 million?","Teresa S. Madden","We had a net proceeds of $223 million.","Andrew Levi","$223 million, excuse me, I apologize. Okay, so you're more than halfway there I guess.","Teresa S. Madden","Right.","Andrew Levi","Equity. And that would take you through what year absent any new projects once you do the $400 million?","Teresa S. Madden","We have previously indicated that we had intended to do $400 million between '13 and '14.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And that would take you through what year once you get that $400 million done? Through '14 or through '15?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, and it's for the next 5 years. We don't have any...","Andrew Levi","Next 5 years, right okay. Unless, of course, I guess if you have some of these new projects, that could change?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, that's correct. We would reevaluate that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Teresa Madden for closing remarks.","Teresa S. Madden","I want to thank you all for participating in our First Quarter Earnings Call this morning.

Let me share a few.","We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September, and subsequently, hit an all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%.","Our O&M declined almost 1%, even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of the Longroad wind assets. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases. We also had a strong year operationally. We continued to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These three projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget.","In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance, while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019, even with two refueling outages. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO.","And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M cost declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and our leadership in our industry.","Moving to the wire side of our business. Our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado, as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year.","Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2019, we estimate we reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence, and we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We've provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition.","As a result, we've managed our transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements. We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites, and we've worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there is continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing Sherco coal plant.","In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo, where we are closing two coal units. Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base. And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and we remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer.","All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors. So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments. And looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multistate wind investment program, which will provide clean, affordable energy to our customers. Longer term, we will add more universal solar, storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030.","We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future. Implementation of our advanced grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables while enabling new offerings for our customers.","We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?","Bob Frenzel","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor, contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal.","However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share. And lower AFUDC due to project timing, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.","Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration and lower frac sand mining sales, which caused sales to be unfavorable. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year.","Turning to expenses. O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in our transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleets, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiencies and taking cost out of the business for the benefit of our customers, as we have for the past five years. And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020.","Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our advanced grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts. In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPAs.","We closed on the acquisition earlier this month, and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the Upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants. As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the non-regulatory returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast. We continue to progress \u2013 we continue the progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company.","Moving to Colorado. The commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3%, a current test year ended August 2019 and an equity ratio of 55.6%, along with other decisions. We view the support for strong capital structure and progress in improving the more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide. But we're disappointed in a low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts; however, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates will be effective in February, 2020. We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas.","In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with a commission decision to follow. In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February, and as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020.","We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in December. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the cost for the Sagamore wind project in the first quarter of 2021. With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.","With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next five years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently, in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year. The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the Longroad assets into rate base, and we put in service, three wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases, and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning everybody.","Ben Fowke","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","So, it doesn't look like there were any real substantive changes to your medium- to long-term outlook from your last disclosures. Your CapEx budget is the same, but you did slightly tweak some of your guidance drivers for 2020, including a modest reduction in the expected O&M growth. I guess I'm wondering, as you look in this year and then you look out over like a five-year planning horizon \u2013 you guys have done a great job, as you say it, bending the cost curve and controlling costs to reduce regulatory lag. And I'm just wondering \u2013 in general, I wonder about the industry, but also specifically with regard to Xcel, how \u2013 as you circle back around and look at your organization, how much leaner do you think you can get given improvements in technology and the cost of deploying renewables, et cetera?","Bob Frenzel","Thanks, Greg, its Bob. It\u2019s a great question. As we give guidance, we do expect modest increases in O&M over the next year or two as we bring the wind onto the system, and we spend some money in very strategic areas like cyber and wildfire risk mitigations. Over the longer term, we expect to keep O&M flat, probably beyond the 2021 period. And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers, looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that. So it's a continuous effort, but I think the guidance for us is flat in 2022 and beyond to what is 2021.","Greg Gordon","Great. Second and last question. I think tomorrow, we're expecting, unless things have changed, rate decisions in Texas for two of your competitors, CenterPoint and AEP. I know that you've got a pending case in that \u2013 where a decision is not expected until later this year. There's been concern about regulatory risk, both lower equity ratios and lower ROEs in that state. Centerpoint looks like they're coming out a little bit better than where they otherwise would have landed, but it's still not a great outcome relative to industry average. How do you think you guys differentiate?","Ben Fowke","Well, Greg, it's Ben. I think, historically, there's been a lot of differences in the pure T&D utility with no customers in ERCOT, like Centerpoint. And a vertically integrated company, like SPS, outside of ERCOT. And you see that we've been in front of the regulator numerous times in the last five years and the equity ratios are what they are as well as the ROE. So I think the more relevant case that I'd look to as I think about how Texas might get resolved, it's actually the settlement we had in New Mexico. As you know, Greg, many of the same interveners in Mexico are going to be the same ones in Texas. So we'll obviously look at those cases, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll have some opportunities to potentially settle the Texas case in the March time frame of this year.","Greg Gordon","Fantastic. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Insoo Kim, Goldman Sachs.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. My first question is on the 2020 outlook for the \u2013 weather-adjusted load growth. Thank you for the color that you gave on what impacted, especially on the electric side, the weather-adjusted load. As you look out towards this year and just having gone through just a month of this year, does that still give you confidence that you could achieve the 1% increase in load, including the leap year impact?","Bob Frenzel","Yes. Insoo, its Bob. Thanks for the question, and appreciate you on the call. I think our sales forecast is reasonably conservative. We did have some discrete declines in our large C&I customers in 2019 that we don't expect to continue in 2020. And underlying those discrete items, we do have strong customer growth, which is slightly moderated by use per customer. But I think our forecast is as expected, and we don't expect to adjust that from guidance.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Thank you. And my second question. In Minnesota, with the ongoing discussions on the Clean Energy First, potential legislation. How did the latest discussions fit in with your overall timing and shape of fleet transformation that you've laid out in the RP? And do you see \u2013 and if there are changes, do you see potential opportunities or challenges relative to the original plan?","Ben Fowke","Well it\u2019s a really good question. I think Clean Energy First basically codifies what we're already planning to do. And so this would be the second time that it was \u2013 where the state is looking to legislate that Clean Energy First legislation. And I think there will be some opportunities that come out of it. For us, it's important that we make sure we do this in the most efficient way possible. We recognize the very strong importance of our nuclear energy.","And we recognize the fact that as we close and shut coal plants on a voluntary basis to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that our investors have some opportunities to be rewarded as well. So we'll see where it goes. We're going to move forward. We're filing our IRP plan, and that's, as you know, that's \u2013 so we've filed it, rather, and that will be discussed throughout the year. And it's \u2013 and I think it's a pretty extraordinary plan, which has a lot of renewables, some gas, the continuation of our nuclear plants. So I think we're well positioned.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.","Ben Fowke","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, can you hear me?","Ben Fowke","Yes. Good morning.","Bob Frenzel","We can hear you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning. Thank you for the time. So perhaps just to follow up a little bit on the tax extenders' bill and some of the developments on the PTC. I know you guys are always vocal about your opportunities on the wind side. Can you elaborate your latest thinking on repowering specifically given the extension? And I know it's a little early, but just altogether, how do you think about the repowering opportunity in the PPA buyout strategy at large given the extension?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think it's helpful, and that's the short answer. The 60% PTC extension allows you to lock in technology through 2024 with a 60% PTC. So I think that will potentially create some more opportunities, to your point, for repowering, Julien. We \u2013 as you know, we don't have those opportunities embedded in our forecast, but we are certainly going to be looking for those opportunities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then as you think towards the rate case in Minnesota, do you want to give any kind of premise as to how you think about that, again, obviously, being pushed out? But any parameters you think about in setting expectations going forward in that case, specifically? I know you just alluded to some potentially on the last question here, but maybe you just \u2013 to start to open up that conversation?","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean, we pushed it out a year, and I think the terms were constructive. We \u2013 unless we can figure out a way to push it out another year, we'll file in November, with interim rates to go into effect in January of, I guess, that would be 2021. So I don't really have much more details than that. We were pleased to work with the staff and stay out. I think that allows us to focus on the resource plan, and it's nice to be able to take a little burden off the staff too as they've got quite a workload. So could we stay out another year? Well, I don't know. But I guess, I can't add much more color than that, Julien. That's where we are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","That is fair. All right, excellent. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Ben Fowke","Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning. As you're looking in the industry, obviously, you're quite active, both solar and wind. 2020 and 2021, as you're negotiating contracts, both regulated and possibly the PPAs outside of those. What are you seeing just in terms of cost comparisons? Where costs are going, both wind and solar, are they still going down? Are they changing terms? Just wondering if you could characterize what you're seeing going 2020 and 2021, in wind and solar?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think you're still seeing the technologies fall in price. The \u2013 you then have to match that up with the \u2013 where we are with PTCs and ITCs. But as we just talked about, that 60% extension, I think, is going to be helpful. Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind, and we still might. And which is why I'm really pleased we locked down the 100%. I think that's a no-regret strategy in every sense of the word. But I think the technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives, even in a low natural gas environment.","Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-2020s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, and we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas. And then ultimately, we're going to need to start developing technologies, carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a zero percent carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long-winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan.","I will also add Travis, our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal. But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing, it is really significant, and I'm quite proud of this industry.","Bob Frenzel","Yes, Travis, I'll add real quick. Our year-over-year fuel cost decline was about $325 million. And while half of that was just lower commodity prices, natural gas and coal, the rest of that is our steel-for-fuel program coming home to roost to the benefit of our customers. And while we are investing steel into the ground and have capital cases for recovery, you're seeing the real benefit on the fuel line. And that does accrete to the customers, and it provides some headroom in the bill for us for continued investments in the distribution and transmission grids, which we know we need.","Travis Miller","Yes, great. Thank you. And then did I hear you correctly, you do not plan on any unregulated renewable energy acquisitions, but you would possibly keep doing the PPA-type acquisitions? I \u2013 just to make sure there's not a change there from what you said.","Ben Fowke","So, our goal is to look for PPA buyout opportunities or repowering opportunities with the benefits flowing to the customers. So that means putting them in regulated operations and into rate base. That's always been the plan. Of course, we offer that as well for a gas fired plant in Mankato, and commission decided the benefits which were primarily back-end loaded weren't sufficient enough to go forward.","So we made the decision that we would \u2013 the asset was important enough and we thought \u2013 valuable enough that we would hold it in our portfolio, but as a non-reg selling into the utility under long-term power purchase agreement. But I try to say you that more is an anomaly than anything else and I would challenge anybody to find a utility that is more focused and has more of their growth \u2013 100% of their growth coming from regulated operations. There's nobody that's more pure play and vertically integrated than Xcel Energy, and that's the way we mean to keep it.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ben Fowke","Hey, Ali.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Hi, good morning. First question, in 2019 as you noted in the slides, at the OpCo level you earned a 9.06% ROE. Can you just remind us what earned ROE is embedded in your 2020 guidance at the OpCo level?","Bob Frenzel","Yes. Ali, its Bob. Our weighted average regulated ROE is about 9.4% across all of our jurisdictions and we still have approximately 50 basis points of leakage and lag in that. So high-8%s is probably a good number right now.","Ali Agha","I see. So, Bob you'd expect a little bit of leakage or a reduction from what 2019 ended up earning?","Bob Frenzel","I do mostly driven by a lower ROE in Colorado electric case. We're still working on trying to close that ROE gap, and we think we have some opportunity over the longer term to do that.","Ben Fowke","Ali, I think it's important to note, though, that we are \u2013 I will tell you, we are disappointed in the ROE we received in Colorado. But as Bob mentioned, there were some positive things there, too. But as you \u2013 as we're into the end of January, and we see the puts and takes that we've had so far, I would tell you that we are solidly positioned to be in the middle of our earnings guidance range.","Ali Agha","Okay. And secondly, I know your current 2020 through 2024 CapEx five year is roughly around $22 billion. And Ben, you alluded to looking at additional opportunities, whether it's renewables, et cetera, if they do arise. Just from a constraint perspective in terms of whether it's rate case, I mean, rate impact to customers or balance sheet, et cetera, how much can you stretch that $22 billion if there were opportunities? Or do you not see any constraints if the right opportunities are there?","Ben Fowke","Well, I don't \u2013 if the right opportunities are there, there are no constraints. And we're focused on CapEx that helps reduce total bills for our customers. And where we can find those opportunities, if it's a PPA buyout, that's great, if; it's trading O&M for capital, that's great; if it's more steel for fuel, that saves customers money on their fuel bill, more than offsets the capital cost and the associated return, that's great. We're always going to be looking for that. And longer term, I think we're in the early days of beneficial electrification and saving customers' money on their total energy bill with EVs and other opportunities. ","So I'm excited about the capital opportunities we have to invest. And I think we've demonstrated we can grow our regulated rate base, again, it's 100% of where we get our earnings from and keep our bills flat for our customers.","Ali Agha","And last question. Again, a quick reminder. When you look at this 5% to 7% growth rate target that you laid out, can you remind us \u2013 as you stand here today and you look at the opportunities in the CapEx, are you comfortable in the upper half of that range, the higher end of that range? Can you just remind us where you stand on looking at that growth rate from where we are today?","Ben Fowke","Yes, I think we're positioned to be on the upper part of the range. I mean I'd.. ","Ali Agha","Upper part?","Ben Fowke","Yes. Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add?","Bob Frenzel","I agree with that.","Ali Agha","So, higher-end is the way we should think about it?","Ben Fowke","Yes.","Ali Agha","I, see. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Sophie Karp of KeyBank.","Sophie Karp","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Most of the topics have been discussed, I guess, but I just wanted to ","Paul Johnson","Sophie, there's a lot of background noise, we can hardly hear you.","Sophie Karp","Can you hear me now?","Paul Johnson","Much better.","Sophie Karp","Sorry about that. So most of the topics have been discussed, I guess, but I just wanted to circle back quickly on Colorado. Could you discuss where kind of the regulatory environment in the state is going directionally? I guess, with the disappointing rate decision and the initiative of \u2013 in Boulder, like, would it be fair to say, say, overall, it's getting more difficult, maybe or is it not a fair statement?","Ben Fowke","So I don't \u2013 I wouldn't categorize it that way. Boulder has been \u2013 we've been talking about Boulder for 10 years now and probably will be talking about it at least for another five. And that's more centric, I think, to Boulder, and we continue to, I think, do quite well on a legal basis there with supportive commission decisions as well. As far as the regulatory environment in Colorado, yes, I mentioned, Bob and I both did, we're disappointed in a 9.3% ROE. We think we're one of one of the best-performing utilities in the nation, and that ROE, quite frankly, doesn't reflect that. So likely look for reconsideration on that. ","But longer term, Sophie, I believe that what we're doing \u2013 and what we're doing was codified in the law, last legislative session, we're highly aligned with what our customers and our stakeholders want to see in Colorado. And when I think about how you achieve long-term success, that's exactly how you do it, align with stakeholders and then execute on a crisp basis and that is what Xcel is doing, and I think that bodes well for future success. ","Sophie Karp","Terrific, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint.","Ben Fowke","Hey, Andy. How are you doing?","Andrew Levi","Was going to ask you about growth rate but I guess Ben, I just wanted to really to get your thoughts on \u2013 obviously, you've mentioned ESG and how it's kind of taking up a big \u2013 a big growing kind of the industry as far as how people are investing. But I guess another part that's been talked about relative to ESG is natural gas. And whether it's as in LDC, whether it's midstream, whether it's fracking, whether it's even using it in your power plant as the fuel. Ben, I just wanted to get your thoughts just on natural gas as a commodity and whether you think it's clean or dirty or \u2013 and then in the context of ESG, if you kind of agree with some people's view that it's a dirty fuel.","Ben Fowke","Yes. Well, Andy, I think that is a very good question. It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned. And early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan. ","And we're moving away from coal completely here in the Upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a \u2013 this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid, but experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%. ","That's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're \u2013 but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EEI, that's a message I want to get out there. Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix. ","I will also tell you that here in the Upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So \u2013 and we've got of keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue, but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere there. ","Andrew Levi","Thank you, Ben. That was actually a great answer. Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Hey, good morning. How are you doing?","Ben Fowke","Hey, Paul.","Bob Frenzel","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just really quickly on Ali Agha's questions, I just wanted to follow-up. Are you guys indicating that you \u2013 in general \u2013 just to make sure I understand it that you don't expect any rate increases, when everything is factored into a fuel and everything else, with respect to your regulatory objectives of your CapEx objectives?","Ben Fowke","No, Paul. I hope I didn't give that impression. I mean our goal is to keep our total bills to customers at or below the CPI index. And if you look back on some of our \u2013 and look in our investor deck, you can see that we've done that over the last five years. Now what \u2013 the other \u2013 you will see increases as well in the KWH rate but remember, that's only one component of a total bill. So we're really focused on keeping bills, again, CPI or less as we go through this time frame. ","And our analysis says we can with the right deployment of technology and supportive public policy. That's really important because you can also make it much more expensive than it needs to be. But \u2013 and That's where we are.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And is there any thought about maybe going to sort of PBR, sort of a CPI minus x or something like that if that's sort of the objective maybe. And maybe not have all these sort of rate cases and rate proceedings?","Ben Fowke","You mean like change the regulatory compact for something around that?","Paul Patterson","It's not the regulatory compact so much it's just the regulatory \u2013 I mean you guys are going in all the time for rate increases or rate cases, if you follow me, and they're kind of \u2013 you seem to know more about it than I do, they can be kind of tactical and what have you. In some places around \u2013 in some jurisdictions internationally, you have something like a CPI minus x, where basically \u2013 it's a sort of performance-based rate making sort of thing, where your rates do \u2013 where inflation is taken into account in terms of where your rates are set periodically. I don't know. I was \u2013 just was wondering if there's any thought about something like that or...","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean, we're always open to new ideas, but I think you have to be pretty cautious when you start addressing those sorts of things, Paul. And we do file a number of cases and \u2013 that we spent a lot of time on calls like this, talking about it, but we've got a great track record of managing that. And we've got, I think, a very good track record of aligning with policymakers, which, again, on a long-term basis, gets you where you need to be. So in my experience, some of those mechanisms aren't necessarily good for the companies that have them \u2013 that have those in place. They can be, but they can also be harmful as well. ","Paul Patterson","Sure. Sure. I was wondering if there's any thought about that. That's all. I don't \u2013 I just \u2013 just hearing it, I just thought I'd ask that. That's all.","Ben Fowke","Performance-based ratemaking is great, but sometimes it's not symmetrical, I guess. So that's \u2013 so we're pretty pragmatic about that.","Paul Patterson","Absolutely. And then in terms of \u2013 there's been some questions about, as you know, coal and coal dispatch and you guys made your filing in December in Minnesota. I'm just wondering if going forward, you see additional activity in that? Or anything that you guys are looking at in terms of coal plant retirement? Any sort of flexibility that might be worked into, in terms of potential additional savings that might be enhanced by \u2013 I know you guys are looking at it all the time, but in terms of coal plant retirements or dispatch changes that might also drive savings for customers or for you. How should we think about that? I mean, is there anything \u2013 any \u2013 other than what you guys have been doing for some time now, is there any additional sort of things on the horizon?","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean, first of all, thank you for recognizing what we do with our coal plants up here. I mean I think that working with the commission here, I thought that was a great example of partnership. And moving from must run to economic dispatch, I think that was a positive first step. The commission is very interested in understanding how a pause in coal dispatch could work as we start to ready for the day when we don't have any coal in the upper Midwest. So I think it's \u2013 the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward. ","And to your point Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants particularly when you look at the variable costs of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we're definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch. So, again, with economics in mind, so \u2013 yeah, it does look for us \u2013 to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the upper Midwest.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Ben Fowke","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks.","Bob Frenzel","Well, thanks everyone for participating in our call this morning. We look forward to seeing you out on the road this quarter.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 second quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2016 second quarter results, reaffirm 2016 earnings guidance range and update you on recent business and regulatory developments.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, flat with last year. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly ahead of last year, but a bit behind expectations, reflecting lower-than-expected sales and some unfavorable weather. However, we have taken action to reduce O&M expenses. And, as a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range of $2.12, $2.27 per share.","And Bob will provide more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. While it's been a busy quarter, we've made significant progress in our regulatory initiatives. Let me start out by addressing some of the highlights.","We're making progress in the Minnesota rate case and have participated in several mediation sessions. As a result, we have reached a settlement in principle with several of the parties, but the terms remain confidential until we reach a final agreement. The settlement is anticipated to address all revenue issues. Any settlement would still have to be reviewed by the ALJ as well as approved by the Commission.","We also recently received comments by 15 parties on our Minnesota Resource Plan. Feedback from the parties was generally supportive for our proposal for early retirement of the two units at our Sherco coal plant, replacement of that generation with natural gas combined cycle unit at Sherco and moving forward with significant wind additions in the next five years. A Commission decision is expected later this year.","Now, turning to Colorado. Yesterday, we filed for the implementation of our advanced grid initiative, which comprises major projects to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliability and enable the implementation of new and innovative programs and rate structures.","The project includes the installation of advanced meters and the implementation of hardware and software applications to enhance the distribution system. The estimated capital investment for the project is $500 million, which is included in our base capital forecast. We're excited about this project and view it as a template for advancing and enhancing our system to meet the needs of our customers.","In July, we also filed a decoupling request with the Colorado Commission. The proposed decoupling mechanism would allow PSCo to adjust annual revenues based on changes in weather-normalized use per customer for the residential and small C&I classes. Now this is very similar to the program that was approved in Minnesota. We expect Commission decisions for both the advanced grid initiative and the decoupling proposal by mid-2017.","And finally, last week, we received testimony in our Rush Creek 600-megawatt wind proposal in Colorado and, in general, we had strong support for our project including the staff. The Colorado staff recommended approval of Rush Creek subject to certain conditions including a capital cost cap, a shortened depreciation life, and changes to the timing of the in-service date to coincide with the Pawnee-Daniels transmission line. The staff also recommended granting approval of interim cost recovery through the Electric Commodity Adjustment clause or the ECA as we had requested for the project.","Finally, in support of balanced disclosure, I should point out that of the nine parties that filed testimony, one intervener, the Sustainable Power Group recommended the application should be denied. But we remain on an accelerated schedule, and we expect a Commission decision in November of this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to a regulatory update. Bob.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter include the following: electric margin increased earnings by $0.07 per share; and natural gas margin increased earnings by $0.01 per share, largely due to rate increases and higher capital rider revenue in various jurisdictions.","Offsetting the higher margins were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share; higher interest charges, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share; and increased property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. The higher fixed charges reflect our increased capital investment to add renewables, and improve the reliability of the system for the benefit of our customers.","Our year-to-date earnings are slightly below plan, largely due to lower-than-expected sales and mild weather experienced in the first quarter. However, we have taken actions to hold the line on O&M expenses to offset these headwinds. As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within the 2016 guidance range.","When we initiated guidance earlier this year, we were anticipating weather-adjusted electric sales growth between 1.5% and 1%. This projection included the impact of leap year. However, despite the fact that we continue to see strong customer additions of approximately 1%, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales have actually declined about 0.6% or 1.1% when adjusted for the extra day of sales from leap year.","Our sales continue to be impacted by lower commodity prices on some of our commercial and industrial customers and declining use per customer in the residential class, driven by conservation efforts and gains in home energy efficiency. And while we had expected some C&I growth in the back half of this year, we believe the commodity and economic backdrops make that unlikely.","As a result, we revised our outlook for full year retail electric sales to be approximately 1.5% below 2015 results, which is consistent with where we are year-to-date. And as you come to expect from the company, with lower sales we must prudently manage our operating expenses. We've implemented various cost management efforts to limit expenses that partially offset some of our revenue headwinds.","Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than last year, and we expect O&M to be in line at the conclusion of 2016. And we believe that our recent rate outcomes assume we actively manage our costs. Long term, we continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investments and the use of technology.","On the regulatory front, we remain busy and have made excellent progress in various proceedings in our states. Details of these can be found in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights.","Last year, we filed a multi-year plan in Minnesota which reflected a requested rate increase of approximately $300 million over three years. This was based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January. As Ben noted, we are working to achieve a definitive settlement with several of the interveners. The finalized settlement agreement would still require Commission approval.","In New Mexico, we reached a unanimous rate case settlement which will increase rates by about $23 million. The Commission is expected to rule on this settlement this month and rates would be implemented shortly after that decision.","We also have a pending rate case in Texas in which we're seeking a rate increase of approximately $69 million. We initiated settlement discussions and are hopeful that we will reach an agreement. After the settlement agreement, we would expect a Commission decision in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, final rates are retroactive back to July of 2016.","Finally, we have a pending rate case in Wisconsin. In aggregate, we've requested rate increases of approximately $32 million between electric and natural gas. We expect staff testimony later this month, with a Commission decision in the fourth quarter, and final rates implemented in January of next year.","In summary, we continue to make strong progress on various initiatives.","In Colorado, we filed our Rush Creek application, our resource plan, a decoupling proposal and our distribution grid modernization program. In Minnesota, we are seeking to finalize a settlement in principle in our rate case and are moving towards a constructive outcome in our resource plan. We are on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range and we expect to grow earnings at 4% to 6% over the long term.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. So, just as we think about the cadence of the second half, you obviously, you were $0.01 ahead in the first quarter. You were flat in the second quarter. But you need, I think, $0.08 in H2 to get into the range and presumably more to get solidly in there. So, can you talk about whether you see that coming more in Q3, Q4 or just what the kind of likely drivers are? It sounds like O&Ms might be a piece of the puzzle here, but just how we got that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's going to be pretty balanced through the second half, Jonathan. But to answer your question, as we mentioned in the call, we have top-line revenues coming from New Mexico and the Texas cases. We are seeing some favorable weather for a change. July was a good month. And you'll recall, last year, we continued to see unfavorable weather. And I'm very confident in our ability to manage our revenue streams and our cost initiatives. So, you put all that together and that should put us solidly in the middle.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just on the Minnesota settlement, you said several parties. Does that include the DOC, can you say? And is it \u2013 are we likely to see a three-year deal or something different?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jonathan, I'd just assume keep all the terms and the parties confidential at this point. We want to get the agreement finalized and quickly present it to the ALJ and then move forward from there. So, we'll be able to talk more freely about the terms probably in mid-August.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's helpful, the timing. Thank you. And then, I just wanted to ask if I may \u2013 just one thing on the upside \u2013 the base and upside capital forecast. Yeah. I think the Colorado grid filing you made, it says in the release that that's largely in the base capital forecast, but then you still have that 12% of the upside CapEx is in grid modernization. So, if the Colorado piece is in the base, can you just speak to what's in the 12%?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That would be making a similar proposal on Minnesota.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. I was guessing that, but I think that's it. Thank you, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jonathan.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","We'll go next to Ali Agha at SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Hey. Good morning. So, from your numbers, you've told us that at the OpCo level, the earned ROE LTM was 8.89%. Can you remind us what is the authorized weighted average ROE? In other words how much of a lag would there be when we look at these numbers?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","At the OpCo level?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, right now, our average ROE is somewhere around that upper 9s%, call it 9.8%, so that would be about 100-basis-point lag.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then also drilling into the changes here, so, you've lowered the overall electric sales roughly about 100 basis points from your original and that's $0.05, $0.06 of headwinds, if you will. So, did I hear you right that you've identified costs that will offset all of that or should we assume that the bulk of that will be offset by the cost? I wasn't clear on that.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's various drivers. Cost is a big piece, the additional revenue from Texas and New Mexico, and the fact that we are seeing some favorable weather. You put all that together and that's the offset.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. But I would imagine Texas and New Mexico would be obviously factored into your original guidance. So, the weather and the cost would be incremental is the way to think about it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. But if you take a look at the O&M and the changes we've made in those assumptions.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And then just to get a sense, also to clarify, when you said all key revenue requirements would be part of the settlement if it gets finalized. Obviously, does that include ROE as well? Just to be clear on that, Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah, ROE would be embedded in the revenue assumptions. Now, what needs to still be worked out, just for full disclosure, is some of the rate design elements, things that some jurisdictions you call phase 2, but in Minnesota are typically combined into one proceeding.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Jerimiah Booream with UBS.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","I just wanted to touch upon the upside CapEx plan first. Obviously, you took out the nat gas versus last quarter on the upside plan, which I think was about $300 million. Looks like you replaced it with other. Can you provide any color around what the opportunities are there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the big opportunities are the continued opportunities we see in renewables in our backyard. And with the extension of the PTC and the ITC, we're actively looking at how we can take advantage of those tax incentives to do even more for our customers, so more to come on that.","But it's always worth remembering that we have some of the finest wind resources right in our backyard and that's from Minnesota all the way down to Texas. So, continue to look for those opportunities. That's what we call, again, steel-for-fuel opportunities. And it works so well just like Rush Creek is working so well in Colorado because you basically are buying wind at a price point less than you can lock in natural gas reserves. So, that's a pretty compelling story for customers and, I think, investors alike.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. And that kind of leads to my second question, so on that front in light of the IRS guidance that was given. Do you have any numbers around the potential opportunity maybe on a megawatt basis on maybe what might be rate baseable on the wind front? Or just how you might handle that going forward on repowering specifically?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On repowering?","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. The repowering opportunity in light of the four-year construction guidance from the IRS?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think most of the focus is going to be on new wind. We certainly are going to be looking at repowering opportunities too. But, I think, they're a little more one-off than the opportunities just to add the incremental wind to the system.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next to Chris Turnure at JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Ben and Bob. You talked in your prepared remarks about the Rush Creek staff recommendation being favorable and there being some amendments kind of suggested in there. Was there anything that kind of meaningfully deviated from your expectations in your request? And can you clarify what they said in regards to timing on that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say anything was \u2013 again, it was supportive. But as I mentioned, the shortened depreciation life syncing up more closer to the transmission and service. If all of those recommendations were adopted by the Commission, I do think it would change some of the timing of the project, but that would be it.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Chris, the timing that they suggested would just delay the project going into service from 2018 until late in 2019.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Until late 2019, okay.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Correct.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And how does this project fit into any potential incremental external equity that would be needed to be raised by you guys?","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Chris. It's Bob. We've said since the onset of this project that we would not raise any incremental equity associated with this project.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And then, my only other question is on your load growth forecast kind of going into the year, it obviously is pretty weak year-to-date, and it's a little bit more on the commercial and industrial side. So, hopefully, the impact is not quite as proportionally bad as it would have been on the residential side. But kind of where did you go wrong in hindsight in your forecasting efforts? What was the main cause of that deviation?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think I'll start and I'll ask Bob to chip in where he sees fit. I think we were looking for overall a stronger GDP number, okay. And then we were also looking for more robust commodity markets. And so, when the commodity markets, as you know, have been flat, steel has been very tough, particularly with some of the currency issues internationally, so that is impacting the larger C&I customers.","To your earlier commentary, the margin associated with that is not nearly the same as it would be on the residential side. We do believe, however, though, there is some trickle-down impact that may be impacting the smaller C&I customers. So, we still have some load coming on, but there has been some projects that, talking to our customers, have not materialized as we originally expected. So, does that help?","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. That was helpful. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next to Scott Senchak at Cannon (21:23).","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Hey, Scott (21:26).","Unknown Speaker","Hi, thanks. Hey. How are you? Just a question on some of the upside CapEx. If you start to execute on more of this stuff, how should we think about financing and what kind of metrics you want to be at? Would you need any equity if you hit all this stuff? Just any color on that.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Scott (21:43), it's Bob. Our expectation is if we executed on the upside capital case that we would unlikely need any equity in the program. We do watch our credit metrics closely. We've committed to keeping strong credit ratings at the operating company and the holding company, but we wouldn't expect to issue any equity in conjunction with the upside capital program.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess just \u2013 you talked a little bit about more wind in Minnesota. I'm just wondering how is the market up there? Is it able to handle more wind? Are we at a point where it's easy to add more wind? I know SPP has hit some kind of records on wind lately. And just kind of where are you in that marketplace?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, MISO is a big footprint and so, I mean, I certainly think from a reliability standpoint, from a grid standpoint, you can handle more wind, and there's going to be more wind, and it's pretty economically compelling right now. So, I'm not too worried about that. Scott (22:49), in Colorado, where we're not part of an RTO, we have experienced wind as high as I think 65% of our load in any particular time and we've managed to integrate it very well. And part of that is we've developed some of the most sophisticated wind forecasting software in the business and it's helping us be more efficient with wind. So, very little curtailments in our wind portfolio; we're pretty proud of that.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And so, that other bucket that's about 22%, I guess how should we think about if that is incremental renewables, is that something has to be done in a rate case? Or are these kind of one-off things? Or how should we think about timing of that as well?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm looking at the 22% \u2013 hang on a second. Are you talking about on the upside cases?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Yeah. The upside case.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, listen. I mean, remember that we have riders to cover renewable in our big jurisdictions of Minnesota and Colorado.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. So, it would still need to be approved before it was able to go in the rider? Or how would that work?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. That's correct. You still got to get a Certificate of Public Need.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. Okay. But the numbers, at this point, you guys see is pretty compelling. Okay. Thank you very much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next is Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thanks.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","If you look across your rate cases that are in process and any kind of other regulatory discussions you've had, what would you say are the one or two things, components that you're seeing the most pushback on? Is it ROE? Is it capital structures? Is it CapEx plans, O&M? What components are you seeing the most pushback on either from interveners or from regulators?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's not really O&M because we're not asking for a lot of O&Ms. So, it's going to be in the capital. It's usually very much aligned with our stakeholders. So, I would say, the biggest pushback is the fact that we're in a low interest rate environment now for a number of years and it is putting downward pressure on ROEs. And that's the challenge.","The opportunity we have is, I think, we increasingly are sharpening our pencils and figuring out how to manage our revenue streams and keep cost consistent with where we see sales growth. So, you put all that together and, I think, we meet the challenge. And, I think, we're well positioned to meet the opportunities out there, which is finding that steel-for-fuel opportunities, finding things that are aligned, like our advanced grid initiative, with what our stakeholders want and balancing that with a really affordable proposition to our customers. And I think we've strike the right balance at the end of the day.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. You'd answered my other question, so I appreciate it.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next to John Barta at KeyBanc.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just to take a step back on Rush Creek, I know it has to be reasonably priced and show an economic benefit, but what's the underlying driver behind the increased renewables. Is it (26:13) RPS or what exactly?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's continuing to decarbonize our fleet with affordability in mind. And in this case, what you're doing with Rush Creek is primarily displacing fossil fuels. And so, you're lowering your carbon footprint and you're doing it at a price point that is compelling. That's a pretty winning proposition in my book.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on the Colorado IRP, do you have the long-term load growth assumption?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The Colorado IRP?","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","John, I think, we'd have to give \u2013 why don't you give me a call and we can get back to you on that. (26:58).","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And next to Ben Budish at Jefferies.","Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. I just had a similar question on the load growth forecast post 2016. Just curious what's built into the 4% to 6% growth and kind of what kind of sensitivity there is around any deviations in the load growth?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think beyond 2016, we're looking at flat to marginal sales growth. Okay. So, that's the key question there. And embedded in the 4% to 6% is our ability to meet some of the challenges. We talked a little bit about some of the impact of ROEs that have fallen across the nation. Our ability to meet that with prudent cost control and then, capturing the great opportunities, again, that are right in our backyard, the steel-for-fuel opportunities, the de-carbonization at an affordable price point. Those are all the things that I would say that are embedded in those growth assumption.","Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one more question. I think earlier in the call, you mentioned O&M was expected to be in line at the end of the year. Did you mean in line with the guidance of 0% to 2% or in line as in flat versus 2015?","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Sorry, the latter.","Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Robert C.

In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions.","This morning, we will review our 2017 first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webcast.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Bob will discuss our quarterly results and provide a regulatory update. I want to give you a quick update on our steel-for-fuel program.","We've made excellent progress on our steel-for-fuel strategy, and have proposed adding almost 3,400 megawatts of new wind to our systems by 2020. In addition, we plan to own more than 80% of this new wind generation.","Let me give you a quick update on our major initiatives. As we've previously discussed, the Colorado Commission approved our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind project in 2016. Rush Creek is progressing as planned and is expected to go into service in 2018.","In Minnesota, we recently proposed adding 1,550 megawatts of new wind generation, which reflects ownership of 1,150 megawatts and power purchase agreements of 400 megawatts. We have requested that the Minnesota Commission approve this proposal no later than July.","Finally, we also recently proposed adding 1,000 megawatts of self-build wind and 230 megawatts of power purchase agreements in Texas and New Mexico. We have requested that the commissions approve these projects and associated recovery mechanisms by the end of the year.","As a result of our safe harbor actions in 2016, we're able to secure 100% of the production tax credit benefits and maximize savings for our customers. Based on current forecast, we estimate billions of dollars of savings over the life of these projects, which will offset the capital cost to the benefit of our customers.","In addition to the financial benefits, we expect to continue our long trend of decarbonization and realize CO2 reductions of at least 45% by 2021. These are very exciting times for Xcel Energy as we continue to transform our fleet in a cost-effective manner.","Our continued commitment to carbon reduction and renewables growth has once again been recognized by the American Wind Energy Association. Just last week, Xcel Energy was named the number one energy provider for the 12th consecutive year. This demonstrates our long-term vision and commitment to environmental leadership.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. We realized another solid quarter of earnings of $0.47 per share in 2017, compared with $0.47 per share in 2016. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include: higher electric margins, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to rate cases and non-fuel riders to recover our capital investments; and a lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to wind production tax credits, which flow back to our customers.","Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share; higher interest expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share; and other items, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.02 per share.","Weather was warmer than normal for the first quarter this year and for the first quarter of last year. As a result, our electric and natural gas margins had a combined $0.01 per share adverse weather impact as compared to last year. However, when compared to normal, warm temperatures in the first quarter reduced earnings by $0.035 per share. Despite the impact of warm winter weather, our first quarter results remained consistent with our internal budget due to our continued focus on cost management.","Our O&M expenses were $9 million higher in the quarter. However, this increase was driven by $8 million of O&M expenses that were deferred from 2016 due to the timing of our Texas electric rate case settlement approval. This higher expense in Texas was equally offset by additional revenue.","Our objective is to keep total O&M expenses relatively in line with 2016 expenses. We continue to focus on increasing productivity as we finish up the implementation of our new work management system across the company, which is progressing extremely well and will be fully completed by year-end.","Turning to sales. On a weather and leap year adjusted basis, our electric sales improved 0.3%, reflecting approximately 1% growth in the number of customers across most customer classes and jurisdictions, offset by lower use per customer. Our first quarter sales were in line with our full-year forecast of 0% to 0.5% growth.","Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement in the Minnesota multi-year rate case. It indicated the settlement will contribute to establishing just and reasonable rates. The commission is expected to deliberate in May and issue an order in June. As a reminder, we've been collecting interim rates since January of 2016.","In Colorado, we have several regulatory proceedings before the commission. In our decoupling docket, hearings are complete and we expect a commission decision in the next month or so. In our advanced grid certificate of need proceeding, we are in settlement discussions with several of the interveners and have made significant progress.","As a result, we'll likely spread out the capital investment associated with advanced grid over a longer period of time to minimize the customer impact. Hearings are scheduled for May and we expect a final decision in mid-2017.","Last week, the New Mexico Commission dismissed our rate case, claiming the filing was incomplete and did not include all the required jurisdictional cost information. We disagree with this assessment and feel the decision to dismiss our rate case was overly punitive. Our filing was consistent with past filings and included all the required cost allocation information. While New Mexico is a very small portion of our business, the decision is disappointing. We have filed for reconsideration and will consider our legal options.","Finally, we plan to file rate cases in Colorado and Wisconsin during the second quarter. We expect decisions in these cases by year-end or early in 2018. As Ben discussed, we filed wind proposals at both NSP-Minnesota and SPS. The combination of these proposals and previously approved Rush Creek project could result in us owning an incremental 2,750 megawatts of wind generation by 2020. This equates to approximately $4.2 billion of capital investment for renewable projects for the 2017 to 2021 period, if the commission approves all projects.","We'll formally update our capital forecast later in the year when we have more clarity on both the incremental wind and our advanced grid proposals. At that time, we also will roll forward our forecast to 2018 to 2022. We expect that the net effect of the new wind and advanced grid initiatives will extend our capital investment growth period, manage the customer bill impact and minimize financing requirements. This is all part of our strategy to continue to improve asset health, decarbonize our fleet and lower customer bills, which deliver long-term value for both our customers and our shareholders.","With that, I'll wrap up. We posted solid results for the quarter. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy with wind proposals, followed by NSP-Minnesota and SPS. We're on track to deliver our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. In addition, we increased our dividend 6%, consistent with our goal of 5% to 7% growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll hear first from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Ben or Bob, in your original CapEx budget that you read out for us 2017 through 2021, of those $18.4 billion, at that time, there was a placeholder 9% you were calling other. Given all of these projects that you've laid out, is it fair to say it's not only the 9% other being filled by those projects, but we've actually exceeded $18.4 billion? How should I be thinking of the total cumulative number now?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, Ali, are you talking about the placeholder we had for renewables?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. Well, clearly, if we get all of these projects approved and ultimately built, that would add about $700 million to that particular placeholder, that renewables placeholder. I do think it's important for you to recognize too though that there are moving parts. We'll probably extend some of our work on the advanced grid initiatives beyond 2021. In addition, we'll continue to look for steel-for-fuel.","And we'll put all that together and wrap that around an updated forecast, which will come out in the third quarter. Of course, as you know, Ali, at that timeframe, we'll drop 2017 and add 2022. Recognize 2017 as a fairly heavy CapEx year for us. So I think the takeaway is, we continue to have really solid organic growth opportunities.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And so, again, from a big picture perspective, as you look at all the pluses and minuses, Ben, is the CAGR that you've laid out for us still where it is roughly, or has it gone up, or how should we think about that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, again it's a lot of moving parts, but I think through the 2021 timeframe, we've got more upside than anything else. But I don't think you should just take $700 million and add that to the CapEx.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then, Bob, also remind us, how much cushion or headroom do you have from a balance sheet perspective in terms of \u2013 if CapEx does go up, how much more CapEx can you absorb without having to hit the equity markets?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I'm going to turn it over to Bob. But, Ali, we've got a great balance sheet and, as you know, we don't have to do any equity at the 2018 for CapEx in this timeframe.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Ali, we've reviewed this capital plan with the agencies, and they were comfortable with our financing plan. If we had any material change to our forward capital plan, we'd obviously go back and work with the agencies on the financing plan for any change in that forecast. But, right now, I think we're comfortable with where we're at. And as Ben indicated, we don't expect to issue equity under this capital plan.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. But, Bob, is it fair to say that there is probably some more headroom, even if that 2018 floor were higher, there may still be some more headroom for you to go above that and still not have to issue equity?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we've pushed those analytics that far, Ali. I mean, suffice to say that if we decided to spend more capital and we had more initiatives, I think you'd have to think about the character of that capital, what years it would come in relative to our current forecast.","As you know, with this wind build, we've got 2018, 2019 and 2020 are pretty high capital years for the company. So, if you're talking about adding capital in 2021 or something different, that's different than adding capital to the front end of that cycle. So I think there's a lot of moving pieces in that question.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. And then, as you lay out in the slide deck on LTM last 12-month basis earned ROE at the opco level was 8.81%. Can you just remind us what's kind of baked into the 2017 guidance in terms of earned ROE? And how much regulatory lag would that still imply, assuming you hit your targets?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Sure. As you imply, in the slide deck, we referenced what is the regulated operating company ROE on a consolidated regulated basis of around 8.8%. That's a little bit lower than our run rate at 12\/31, predominately due to the weather impacts in the first quarter.","We expect 2017 to look a lot like 2016 in terms of earned ROE. And when you think about that as compared to our allowed ROEs, our weighted average allowed is probably 9.6%, so that leaves an ROE gap of 50 to 60 basis points.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And is that a natural gap we should think about from a fictional point of view or would that be practically filled up as well?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","We always try to close that gap. It's been a strategic initiative for the company for a while. Obviously, as you're building in regulatory jurisdictions that have historic test years and lag periods in rate-makings, that's going to cause some natural lag. And there's some items that cause some natural leakage. But I think that that's a focus area for the customer to continue to try and close that gap.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","And, Ali, part of our plan always has been to go into these longer-term regulatory compacts, which allow us to more effectively, I believe, manage to the revenue streams that we've been provided.","And I think we're in the early days of what we can accomplish on sustainable cost control and process improvement. Clearly, we need to take a look at what happens at the macro level with overall revenues, et cetera, but our goal is to continue to close that gap.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Thank you very much. Perhaps just a follow-up on that last comment, just if I can, topical. Can you elaborate a little bit? You said early days of what we can accomplish, I think.","I take that to mean that you have confidence in addressing that 50 to 60 basis points of ROE gap on a trailing basis here. Is that a fair statement? Or is that rather a statement when you were saying early days that, at least, you can stay out of rate cases or something like that? And I'll leave it there.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, it's kind of all of the above, Julien. Our vision is to continue to decarbonize and do so in a way that allows us to save customers money, which sets up the dialogue, can you stay out of rate cases. And I think there's more to come on that.","I think what we're seeing in our early efforts and initiatives to really focus on cost, I mean, it makes us confident that we can keep O&M flat. Can we do more? Well, we'll see. But I think it positions us very well going forward to manage the company.","And part of that successful management will be to close that gap between what we actually earn and what we're authorized to earn. And I want to make it clear that there's always going to be some structural limitations there. I mean, things that our regulators don't allow us to recover, for example, executive comp, which is very important. Not to be too silly.","But we'll continue to work towards closing that, as Bob mentioned, off of an average 9.6% and I think you'll continue to see us make progress.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Back to our regularly scheduled question. On the Colorado side, I'd be very curious; do you see the ability to expand the owned component of the wind? You've obviously scaled up your commitments in the other jurisdictions thus far. Perhaps, if not now, when would you next evaluate more of this similar fuel-for-steel component?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think we had a breakthrough, as you know, Julien, with Rush Creek. And that's owned, and that was a departure from the past. But just to step back, I absolutely do. I think we've demonstrated that we can build and own and do so at a fantastic price point for our customers, and it's our intention to expand upon that.","And I firmly believe too, as we transition to this cleaner energy future, that we are the natural owner of many of these assets and should be and, quite frankly, have earned the right to be.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And there's no natural cadence that we should expect to come out at some point for the expansion of Rush Creek or what have you?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I'm not sure about the natural cadence of timing. Well, we're going to continue to look for opportunities. We file our standard resource plans. A lot of it has to do with what's next in decarbonization. So I don't know if that's a continuous kind of thing, like a little bit each quarter, or if it's going to be a little more lumpy as we go forward. But we will be going forward and that is the overall plan.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just last follow-up question real quickly, a little bit of a scenario. For New Mexico, if you can elaborate, if unsuccessful in the rehearing petition here, would you simply seek to re-file at an appropriate point in time? I'm just curious, if you're unsuccessful on that route, what the next step is and the timing of that next step?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","To your point, first thing is hopefully get a successful reconsideration. We will look at legal options, including a petition to the Supreme Court. Julien, I don't think there's any merit to justify dismissing this case. There really isn't.","But to your last point, yeah, and ultimately we'll look at re-filing the case in as quick as manner as possible to minimize the lag that we're suffering from. And I think we can do \u2013 I think all of those options can provide that pathway we need.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Travis Miller with Morningstar has the next question.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Trav.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Trav.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Wonder if you could clarify again the renewable builds. So those projects that you went through and listed at the beginning, are there any in there or are they all incremental to what you've previously announced and what was in the CapEx plan? I don't know whether I caught that.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Take that, Bob?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So what we discussed today was the totality of the newbuilds in each of our jurisdictions. Ben mentioned Rush Creek, that's been previously in our capital plan and was approved by the Colorado Commission, and it's under construction.","We announced new wind in our Upper Midwest system, 1,550 megawatts, 750 megawatts of self-build, 400 megawatts of build transfer and 400 megawatts of PPAs. I think what was new was probably the 400 megawatts of the self-build proposal, which, as Ben indicated, could be somewhere around $700 million of capital if all of our projects were approved, in addition to the original capital program.","And then, obviously in the Southwest, at our SPS Company, we had a 1,000 megawatts of self-build and 200 megawatts of PPAs. And I think all of that 1,000 megawatts of self-build is included in our capital estimates that we talked about back at EEI.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, Travis, maybe the way to think about it is, we were quite confident when we put that placeholder out for $3.5 billion that we would be able to find those steel-for-fuel opportunities and as Bob mentioned, for example, the self-build opportunities in the SPS jurisdictions, et cetera. But what we have found is that some of the bids were so compelling, and particularly some of the build-own-transfer bids, that not only did we fill our estimate of the $3.5 billion, but we've actually exceeded it with what is now on the table.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. I get that. Was that 400 megawatts, the $700 million incremental all in Minnesota or it's spread out across jurisdictions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","All in the Upper Midwest, so it's all in the NSP.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","NSP. Okay. And then, given that you guys had pretty flat earning, even if you adjust for the weather in this quarter, what time of year this year do you get that 6%? What kind of quarter should we be looking at in terms of reaching that 6%, the annual growth rate?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Travis, with the challenging weather we saw in the first quarter, we expect \u2013 and our plan is actually expected the back half of the year to have higher earnings in the first quarter anyway. So I don't think that the weather in and of itself prevents us from achieving our earnings. In fact, we're confirming our earnings as part of this call.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And the back half of the year being where you'd get most of that growth to reach to 6% type level?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","It would be in the final three quarters, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I was guessing that.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Obviously definitive.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","My astute analysis came at that point.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","...expenses aren't recovered either but...","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Indeed. I will model that in. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll now move to our next question that will come from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Jon.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Jon.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Ben, I think...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Steel-for-fuel, Jonathan. Steel-for-fuel.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So question on that. You said, I think, that we shouldn't sort of add the incremental beyond the $3.5 billion to our view of CapEx through 2021 because some other things may move around. And you specifically mentioned that you might push out advanced grid somewhat. What's driving that? Because if \u2013 presumably, it's not going to build impact, because steel-for-fuel is going to be saving people money, right?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Steel-for-fuel is definitely self-funding and I'd say it's a lot of money for our customers. But when you're investing in the grid, there is an impact to the consumer on that. And so we're just working, particularly in Colorado, with our stakeholders, the staff, regulators, et cetera, to make sure that the plan is within the pocketbook, if you will, on an annual basis from a customer's perspective.","So we're not changing anything. I mean we're still going to move forward with all the advanced grid initiatives, but we might just go at a little bit more gradual pace. I don't think it's a major change. I just wanted to point that out to you. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to optimize our capital spend from a consumer standpoint.","At the same time, Jonathan, we continue to look for more steel-for-fuel opportunities. So the whole point there was \u2013 it's a little more complicated than just adding the CapEx to the $3.5 billion and saying that's the new CapEx forecast, which is why we update it on an annual basis, and we continue to plan to do that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, that was just an example of something that you might be just re-pacing a little?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think that's fair.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, you've brought it up, so what's a good timeframe to be thinking about the next round of steel-for-fuel?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, we're always looking. We always have opportunities and we're working with stakeholders across the board. I mean, I don't have anything specific to report on, but there's always activity.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, just finally, I don't know \u2013 one of the reasons cited for dismissing the New Mexico case was \u2013 it had to do with allocation between the jurisdictions. So I'm curious, how do you manage against that becoming an issue in the wind filing you'll be making? And have you kind of given an indication of how that cost is going to shake out between the jurisdictions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think that really will be an issue with the wind filings. And quite frankly, I don't think it was an issue with our rate case filing. It was made an issue, to be perfectly blunt about it. And the key with these wind filings is, I think it's well-recognized that this is going to be very good for customers. It's going to be very good for regional economic development. And again, I think the amount of money that we're saving the customers, I think, justifies better regulatory recovery of not only the wind, but in general, better treatment for that region of the country, particularly New Mexico.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And have you said how this will sort of break down in terms of who gets the largest share of that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, it's an integrated system. So just let me turn to \u2013 what is typically \u2013 I know, the wholesale, there's Texas and then there's New Mexico...","Marvin E. McDaniel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Texas is; this is Marvin. Jonathan. Texas is about 50%, wholesale is about 30% and New Mexico is about 20%. And so that...","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, that would be a \u2013 is that a sensible rule of thumb to be thinking about it?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's just a rule of thumb on the sales. And then I'd add to Ben's response about allocation. The question in the New Mexico case was finding the allocated cost drivers. The question was not with regards to how much was allocated to New Mexico. So it wasn't an issue of the cost being allocated. It was the issue of finding the information.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Marvin E. McDaniel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You're right. Again, we believe and it was all included in our filing.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And now we will hear from Chris Turner with JPMorgan.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Chris?","Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase","Good morning. Ben, I think you had touched on this a little bit in the last question. But when we think about what \u2013 I think you anticipate it as a year-end decision for the wind at SPS. My understanding is it's not part of an integrated resource plan process, like was the case in Minnesota. So how do you think about regulatory strategy there in your ask? How do you think about rate recovery, customer bills, et cetera, there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I know this is going to save customers money. And so our ask is that, just like the customer gets immediate savings, we should be getting immediate recovery of those investments. That's the basic premise of our regulatory ask.","Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase","Okay. And then, just the idea that this is a money-saving investment for customers do you think would be enough to convince the two commissions to give it a green light as opposed to a need for new generation in and of itself?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. The question will always be \u2013 I think everybody's going to be really appreciative of the customer savings, and what we have to do is convince them that there's a need to also to take care of the company and its shareholders that are putting up the capital for these investments. And that's concurrent recovery.","Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase","Okay. And then, switching to Colorado, I think there's two potential filings this year. How can we think about the timing and kind of other considerations there? And should we assume that the content of the electric case will be another standard three-year multi-year ask? And then, on the gas side kind of a forward-looking one-year ask, and kind of hoping to get that versus the historical test year that you've been awarded ask a couple of times?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I would think you, on both, the effort will be to do enter into multi-year plans. If I was going to handicap, then I would say we're very confident on the electric side and cautiously optimistic on the gas side.","Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase","Okay. And no other changes to strategy there or indications of when you're going to file?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Chris, I think we indicated that we expect to file gas and electric probably in the next quarter or so separately but shortly thereafter each other. And so I don't think the strategy on the timing of the filing is any different than what we've previously communicated.","Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Morning, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC","How are you guys doing? I think most of my questions were asked. One question. When may you possibly revisit the long-term earnings growth rate, if you do at all?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, we'll periodically look at it. I will tell you, Andy, that we're certainly positioned in this period to be at the upper end of that 4% to 6%.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Okay. And do you review that on an annual basis? Would that be something maybe when you come out with your new capital plan that you would take a look at it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there's no set timeframe. So it's \u2013 we look at it periodically and when we feel it needs to be adjusted, if it does need to be adjusted, we react accordingly.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Okay. And then the second question I have is just \u2013 and you've alluded to it and then there was some Q&A on it too. But just on the cost savings potential or in the sense making the company more efficient, it sounds like you're in kind of the early innings for that. Is that kind of a good way to categorize it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I'll let Bob answer it.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Andy, that's a good way to characterize some of the initiatives we have in progress, including our productivity through technology initiative. But, as you know and are well aware, we've held our O&M costs flat for the past three years and our guidance is to keep them in that range.","And so, as we continue to look at different ways to continue to bend the cost curve, whether it's through supply chain, commercialization efforts or technology that drives efficiency, you should expect the company to continue to look for opportunities to continue to bend the cost curve.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Okay. But, again, but just timing-wise, I guess you've been doing it for a while, but then what you continued to find opportunities and I guess part of that is based on new technology and things like that. Is that correct?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think that's a fair way to characterize. I mean, we do have structural cost increases in the company, whether it's bargaining unit labor agreement or other labor merit and inflationary pressures or third-party contractual arrangements that may have inflators in them. So we constantly have to bend the cost curve just to stay flat and we're very aggressively attempting to do that.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Steve?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions are answered. Just a technical question with the build-own-transfers. Could you just talk a little bit about how the kind of AFDC and kind of earnings profile of them are the same or different versus just normal rate base? Is it more just when you actually transact at the end?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes. Steve, that's the right way to look at it. On the build-own-transfer, we won't earn AFUDC under construction. It's just a capital transfer at the close of the transaction.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","So both the cap, yeah?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You'd only earn AFUDC if there's a progress payment. And we don't really have progress payments in these projects.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So both your earnings and financing will all come right at the end because you're not financing anything either as it's being built? Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will end your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel, CFO, for any closing remarks.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, thanks, everybody, for your time today. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give our Investor Relations department a call.","Operator","With that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your call for today. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"22624":["Xcel Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) Q1 2016 Earnings Call May  9, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Analysts","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2016 first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. You may have noticed that our earnings call is a bit later than normal this quarter. We just implemented a new general ledger system, so we built a little extra time into the schedule. We're pleased to report that everything went very well with the implementation.","Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2015 first quarter ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which excludes a charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota Commission in the Monticello nuclear prudence review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.30 per share.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Bob will go into more detail later, but in summary, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.46 per share last year.","Overall, it was a solid quarter in which declining O&M expenses offset unfavorable weather and lower than expected sales. While electric sales in the first quarter were below expectations, we expect sales to improve in the second half of the year, and we remain very confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our guidance range. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share.","As we've previously discussed, we are executing on our upside capital investment plan. Later this month, we'll make a filing with the Colorado Commission to add 600 megawatts of wind generation and associated transmission. This represents a rate base investment of just over $1 billion. In April, the Commission confirmed our interpretation of a Colorado law that allows utilities to own 25% to 50% of incremental renewables without going through a competitive bid process, if the project is developed at a reasonable cost compared to similar renewable sources available in the market.","The levelized cost of this wind project including transmission is projected to be below any other existing wind PPAs in the PSCo portfolio. We therefore believe we'll be able to demonstrate to the Commission and the independent evaluator that this project meets and exceeds the reasonable cost standard and represents tremendous value to our customers.","We plan to request a Commission decision by November so that we can capture the full production tax credit benefit for our customers. This capital investment is currently reflected in our upside capital forecast (3:23). If the Commission approves this project, we will move it to our base capital forecast, which will result in rate base growth of 4.5%, a great example of organic and disciplined growth that provides value to shareholders, customers and the economy in our service territory. You should expect us to continue to find investment opportunities of this nature that will drive us to our upside capital goals.","Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes recognizing the outstanding efforts of our employees in responding to a major snowstorm in Colorado. In March, Denver and Northern Colorado were hit with a blizzard with 12 to 18 inches of snow and wind gusts over 60 miles per hour that caused approximately 350,000 outages.","As a result of proactive planning prior to the storm and the work of over 950 employees and contract crews, we were able to restore service to 90% of our customers within 12 hours, 98% of our customers within 36 hours, and 100% of our customers within 60 hours. This was another example of our world-class storm restoration, and I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and tremendous efforts to provide excellent customer service and reliability to our customers.","Turning to other accomplishments, we recently received several awards that are worth mentioning. In March, the EPA and others recognized Xcel Energy with a 2016 Climate Leadership Award for Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management. The award acknowledges our commitment and progress in reducing CO2 commissions (sic) emissions. Military Times ranked Xcel Energy as one of the Top Employers of Veterans in 2016. Finally, in April, AWEA named Xcel Energy the number one wind provider of energy for the 12th consecutive year.","Finally, we recently announced the hiring of Bob Frenzel as our new Executive Vice President and CFO. Bob brings more than 17 years of experience in energy, banking and consulting in addition to six years of experience as an officer in the U.S. Navy. He most recently served as Senior Vice President and CFO for Luminant. Bob brings a wealth of experience that complements our strategies and our business. He understands our industry and has a proven track record of driving excellent performance and solid growth.","Some of the key attributes that Bob brings to the table include strong financial and commercial acumen, excellent strategic vision and execution, an engineering and nuclear background, and an outstanding experience managing cost. He will be a valuable addition to the Xcel Energy team.","I think it's important to recognize that our strategic plans and priorities are not changing. We will continue to focus on organically growing our regulated operations and maintaining the disciplined financial approach you've come to expect from us.","I also want to recognize the outstanding service and contributions of Teresa Madden, who is retiring after a career spanning 36 years. Teresa played a major role in building our track record of delivering on our value proposition and she leaves a solid platform for continued strong results. We're very grateful for her many contributions and we wish her much happiness in her retirement.","So I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Bob?","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ben, for that introduction. I'm very excited to join Xcel and I'm honored to follow in Teresa's footsteps. I commit to continuing Xcel's long tradition of delivering on our financial objectives and growing earnings in a low risk, transparent and predictable manner.","Now, let's get to the details of the quarter. As Ben indicated, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter as compared to $0.46 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Improved electric margins increased earnings by $0.06 per share; this was largely due to interim rates in Minnesota and capital rider revenue for recovery of capital investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Higher gas margins in our gas segment increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which is primarily due to rate increases from higher rate base, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which reflects cost management and some timing-related issues. Partially offsetting these positive drivers was higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting depreciation from new capital investment.","Turning to our sales results, although the economy in our region remains strong and we continue to add customers, our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%. Further adjusting for the impact of an extra day of sales in the quarter due to leap year, our weather-adjusted electric sales actually declined by 1.4%. The decline in sales is largely driven by lower use per customer from energy efficiency, an increase in the number of multi-family units, the impact of distributed solar and the impact on consumption of lower oil and natural gas prices on some of our larger customers.","As a result, we have lowered our full-year electric sales growth assumption to 0.5% from 0.5% to 1% range. We continue to expect positive sales growth for the full year in all jurisdictions, due to customer growth as well as planned expansion from some of our larger customers.","In addition to lowering our sales assumptions, we've also taken actions to lower our full-year O&M expenses. We implemented plans early in the year to offset the impact of the rate reduction in Texas as well as unfavorable weather and lower sales growth. As a result, we now expect to limit our annual O&M expenses to 0% to 1% increase for the full year.","As we continue to strive to close our ROE gap, we have been pretty active on the regulatory front. Let me provide you a quick update. There are additional details included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we recently filed a case seeking an electric rate increase of $17.4 million and a natural gas increase of $4.8 million. This is a limited scope case, and ROE and capital structure are not expected to be an issue. The decision is expected by December, with final rates effective in January of 2017. We also have pending rate cases in Minnesota and in Texas. Both cases are in the discovery stage, and as a result, there aren't any material new developments.","Finally, we recently filed a settlement in our New Mexico rate case, which was reached between SPS, the staff, and other parties. The black box settlement reflects a non-fuel base rate increase of $23.5 million. The settlement represents a compromise which we think is reasonable. The New Mexico Commission is expected to rule on the settlement later this year and new rates are expected to go into effect in August.","As Ben mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance with no changes. However, as I previously mentioned, we have updated several of the key assumptions, including electric sales and O&M expenses as detailed in our earnings release.","Also, please note that we've reduced our assumption for capital rider recovery to reflect the transfer of some pipeline recovery from the rider to base rates as part of our last Colorado natural gas rate case. The transfer has no material impact on earnings.","In summary, it was a good quarter for the company. Continued vigilance on cost management resulted in lower O&M expenses, which offset unfavorable weather and sluggish sales to deliver solid first quarter earnings. We made significant progress to convert some of our upside capital to base capital with a planned filing to own 600 megawatts of wind in Colorado. We anticipate a Commission decision later this year. Finally, we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Ali Agha at SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ali.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, Ben. Good morning. First question, the sluggish sales growth that you alluded to in the first quarter, anything specific \u2013 I know it's early in the year and it's a small quarter, but that would give you that confidence that we're still going to end up on the positive for the year given the negative start to the first quarter?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Ali. It's really the result of conversations our account managers have had with our large commercial and industrial accounts. So we know we're going to be seeing more load come on in the second half of the year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay, and you highlighted the earned ROE through the LTM ending in March 31. Can you just remind us what kind of regulatory lag that would translate into?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's about 90 basis points of lag. And again, as you know, our goal is to cut the lag by 50 basis points by 2018, and Ali, I think we remain on track with that. If you look at Colorado, I think we are on track. The Minnesota case here should put us on track and we will continue to work diligently at SPS to get that on track including filing of cases that take advantage of new legislation in forward test years in Minnesota \u2013 I mean in New Mexico.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And Ben, this Colorado wind filing, are you anticipating much opposition there or I mean is it pretty much a done deal, all you need to do is show the numbers? Can you just handicap us like how we should think about this filing and the approval?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd never say it's a done deal. You need Commission approval, but Ali, in tune to the first part of your question, this project has tremendous community support and it's going to create tremendous value for our customers in fuel savings, even if you look at the lower gas forecast. So we're excited about it, and the community and our stakeholders are excited about it, so we're very confident this is going to go through.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay and last question, when should we start to see some of the other growth investments that you've highlighted for us start to show up in terms of filings and potential move into base CapEx?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, some of that will come through resource plans. I mean that's the big part of it \u2013 filings for grid monetization opportunities that we might be out there to capture value for our customers. So I mean I think you'll see it over the next 12 months basically.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. It's actually Julien here. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi. How are you?","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Thank you. Hey. I wanted to follow up \u2013 a couple quick questions here. Can you elaborate a little bit on your eligibility to participate more than 25% to 50% in Colorado? What would the requirements there be, and elaborate a little bit more on the requirements of that 25% to 50% and what that threshold would be? And then, perhaps, a separate related question would be, the latest on solar, and specifically community solar in Colorado, and any opportunity to own or rate base those assets.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, let's start, Julien, with the 25% to 50% standard of the Colorado legislation. The 25% standard is just \u2013 is the reasonable cost standard that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The 50% standard \u2013 without going through a competitive bid, you need to show economic value to the community. And I think you asked, can you do more than that? Yeah, you potentially could do more than that. But at this point, we would anticipate you'd have to go through a competitive RFP to do that. And that doesn't mean we can't prevail on that. But that's the law that we were referring to. So we're pleased with that.","Now you asked about community solar gardens. At this point, we don't have plans to buy any of those projects or provide any of those projects. It doesn't mean we couldn't, but \u2013 nothing would prevent us, but it's not something we've been actively pursuing at this point.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","The other point, Ali \u2013 or Julien, we will be making a resource plan filing later this spring and we will potentially include some solar in as part of that resource plan, so we'll go forward with that too.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just following a little bit on the first quarter results themselves. Obviously, little bit further from plan on the normalized, and it's always tough to read tea leaves, but what stood out if you were to go back and try to rehash things in terms of factors driving that negative delta?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, you broke up a little bit. Were you asking what drove the negative sales outlook?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah or was there a specific factor more than others? I know you delineated a few there, but was there one that stood out?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean other than the factors that we mentioned, there's always the art versus science of capturing weather and the impact of weather, and we did have some significant mild weather in the quarter, so I'm not sure you can ever fully scrub that out. We follow the formulaic approach, which is blessed by our commissions, but there's always some potential for anomalies.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar Financial.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning, thank you. I guess I'll continue on this demand question line here. If you think about that flat type demand, even 0.5% demand, if that continues for not just this year, but let's say the next two years to three years, how does that put you in position for closing that 50 basis point gap? Does that require more rate cases? Does it require you to change the types of requests you're making, the capital investment? Can you just walk me through kind of how that picture would play out?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it does a number of things, but we've been anticipating relatively flat sales in our outlook for quite some time now, Travis, so our ability to close the ROE gap assumes that we are not going to have robust sales to bail us out. So it means you have to manage your O&M carefully, and we are and we will continue to do that, and in fact I think we're in the early days of cost management.","We will make sure our resource plans reflect those kinds of sales growth opportunities, so we don't overbuild. And of course as you know, we have decoupling mechanisms here on the electric side in Minnesota, which are helpful as well. So there's a number of things you can do from a regulatory standpoint and from an internal management standpoint, and of course from a resource planning standpoint, and that's the environment we anticipate being in.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then just mix between residential and C&I, what's approximately your margin mix, I guess, is the simplest way to put it? When commercial and industrial is 1.5%, residential is down 1.1%, how does that translate into profitability, if you get kind of where I'm going there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me try to \u2013 I ask my team if they can help me with this one. I'll have a much higher profit margin in the residential, and then when you get to the C&I, it really depends on which customer you're talking about and which jurisdiction. For example, the largest industrial customer is in SPS. The sales there will have the most minimal impact on margin, if anybody can help further define that for Travis a bit.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, Travis, if you think about it, the rate per megawatt hour for residential customer is probably going to be somewhere around that $0.11 range and large C&I customer is probably going to be more in that $0.07 range. So it's pretty different revenue stream.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And they pay a larger demand charge too, so variable sales tend to be more of the energy \u2013 it's more the energy pass-through than it is the high margin that you're getting with residential.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Yeah. Okay. Great. I appreciate the thoughts.","Operator","We're standing by. With no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Bob Frenzel for any closing or additional comments.","Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President","Thank you for participating in our earnings call this morning.

Significant factors that cause results to differ than those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, thanks, Paul. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.40 per share compared with $0.38 per share in 2012. New and interim rates in several jurisdictions, combined with positive weather, contributed to our solid quarterly earnings. We also remain positioned to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $1.85 to $1.95 per share.","In a few moments, Teresa will discuss our financial results and regulatory developments in greater detail. I'll now comment on a few recent events, starting with some operational items.","I believe the foundation of a strong utility is how it responds to adversity, particularly large-scale storms. In June, we had an opportunity to demonstrate our capabilities when Minnesota experienced several severe thunderstorms and high winds that impacted over 600,000 of our customers.","Advanced preparation for these types of events enable us to successfully coordinate a workforce of 1,100 linemen and hundreds of support personnel, including crews from several other utilities. As a result, 96% of our customers were restored within 3 days, and everyone was back online by the sixth day. I'm proud that our dedicated employees, contractors and utility peers completed this enormous effort in an orderly, safe and timely fashion.","In addition, I want to thank all the other utilities who provided employees to assist us with storm restoration. The Mutual Assistance Program is an outstanding way for utilities to leverage our workforces, to respond to significant storms in a cost-effective and efficient manner.","I'd now like to discuss the completion of a long-term project to upgrade and extend the life of our Monticello nuclear plant. In July, we brought our Monticello nuclear plant back online after completing a scheduled refueling outage, which included work to allow the plant to operate safely through 2030 and increase its output by 71 megawatts. Scope of this project changed several times as we worked to meet evolving NRC standards for safety, increased the reliability margin and address emergent issues that were discovered during the construction.","Our cost for the project are approximately $655 million, which is above the estimate provided in our 2008 Certificate of Need filings. We have committed to an after-the-fact prudence review. We expect that the overall cost and benefits of the project will be reviewed in the context of our 2014 rate case.","We believe that even with the cost increases, this project will deliver great value for our NSP customers, providing 600 megawatts of reliable, cost-efficient and emission-free generation for the next 2 decades.","We also are pursuing plans to substantially increase our emission-free wind resources. We're always looking for options that work for both customers and investors. Consistent with this approach, we're seeking to add as much as 2,000 megawatts of wind resources across our service territory at very attractive pricing.","These projects allow us to take advantage of the expiring production tax credits, meet state renewable standards and provide significant fuel savings to our customers. To this end, we submitted a proposal to regulators to add 600 megawatts of wind resources in Minnesota and North Dakota. Our proposal includes adding 3 200-megawatt projects, including 1 ownership project.","At SPS, we're seeking to add 700 megawatts of wind power through PPAs. In Colorado, we're proposing adding 200 megawatts of new wind through our PPA. In addition to these 1,500 megawatts of proposed wind projects, the Colorado PUC will decide this fall on whether or not to approve 350 megawatts of new wind PPAs. We're also evaluating our 150-megawatt project in North Dakota that we would own. This project may be brought to the North Dakota and Minnesota Commissions relatively soon.","Adding wind resources today creates long-term value and could save our customers an estimated $800 million to $1 billion in fuel costs over the next 20 years. We anticipate commission decisions on each of these proposals later this year.","We also have RFPs outstanding to add thermal resources at both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo. We submitted bids in Minnesota and Colorado, and expect commission decisions this fall. We hope to update you on these proposed projects during our third quarter earnings call.","Next, I'd like to comment on regulatory developments in Minnesota. Teresa will cover our pending 2013 rate case, but with large investments and our steam generator replacement at Prairie Island and the 2014 impact of the Monticello project, as well as other cost increases, we will need to file a sizable rate case later this year for 2014.","We plan to pursue a multi-year regulatory plan in Minnesota. Recently, the Minnesota Commission issued an order for multi-year ratemaking, which could serve as a template for constructive regulation, providing revenue and regulatory certainty for both our customers and our shareholders. The framework includes the following guidelines: A multi-year rate plan must cover up to 3 years, with the first year representing a fully filed rate case; companies may recover specific capital costs and appropriate O&M costs in the second and third years; the ROE authorizing the rate case will be used for the entire multi-year period; and finally, companies will need to file for fixed rates over the period, with certain costs subject to refund. And the parties have filed for clarification on certain items in the multi-year order, and we expect the commission to issue a final order later this year.","We believe a multi-year plan may allow us to obtain timely cost recovery of our capital expenditures while eliminating the need for multiple rate cases given the substantial investments we continue to make in Minnesota.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I will discuss second quarter results, provide you with an update on recent regulatory development, review our financing plans and update you on our 2013 earnings guidance.","I'll begin by reviewing the second quarter results at each of our 4 operating companies. Earnings in NSP-Minnesota increased $0.03 per share, largely due to interim electric rates subject to refund in Minnesota and North Dakota, and a rate increase in South Dakota. In addition, higher natural gas margins due to cooler weather and lower interest expense also helped to improve profitability.","Second quarter earnings at PSCo were flat. Higher electric and natural gas margins and lower interest charges were offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share, reflecting higher electric and gas rates effective in January 2013, as well as the effect of higher natural gas margins due to the cooler weather.","SPS earnings decreased $0.01 per share, as higher O&M expenses, depreciation and interest charges were partially offset by a rate increase in Texas that was effective in May 2013.","I'll now discuss some of the key drivers of our consolidated earnings results, beginning with retail electric margin. Second quarter electric margin increased $26 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were $56 million from new rate increases and interim rates subject to refunds in certain states. This amount includes the reserve for revenues subject to refund of approximately $31 million at NSP-Minnesota and $10 million from increased transmission revenue net of expenses.","These positive drivers were partially offset by several smaller items, including a $9 million refund at PSCo as a result of estimated earnings test obligation, a $9 million reduction in conservation and DSM incentives and $8 million decrease in firm wholesale revenue and various other items.","Second quarter weather normalized retail electric sales decreased 0.2%. As been noted, we experienced a series of storms in Minnesota in June that impacted over 600,000 customers. We estimated that the impact of these storms reduced our quarterly electric sales by about 22,000 megawatts or 0.1%.","Second quarter natural gas margins increased $21 million, primarily as a result of a $12 million impact from cooler weather and a $7 million increase from higher retail sales growth. Based on year-to-date trends, we now forecast weather-adjusted firm natural gas sales to increase 2% in 2013. Previously, we forecasted a 1% decline.","Turning to expenses. O&M increased 5.3%. The primary drivers of the increase were $12 million of other electric and gas distribution expenses, largely due to increased maintenance activities; $9 million related to higher nuclear plant costs associated with operational initiatives and other smaller items.","Through the first 6 months of 2013, O&M expenses increased 4.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance.","We continue to forecast an annual increase of 4% to 5%, but we will closely monitor our O&M levels to determine if we have to take actions to change spending levels, which will be dependent on circumstances in the second half of the year.","Depreciation and amortization increased $17.3 million or 7.6% due to our ongoing investment in our systems. We continue to forecast D&A to increase approximately $75 million to $85 million. Other taxes increased $2.4 million or 2.4%, largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota, Colorado and Texas. As a result of updated forecast, we now expect our consolidated property taxes will increase between $20 million to $25 million, which is lower than we previously projected.","I'll now provide an update on regulatory developments, beginning with our pending rate case in Minnesota. We will be in front of the Minnesota Commission next week, so we will keep our comments limited. In early July, the Minnesota ALJ issued a report and recommended a rate increase of approximately $127 million based in an ROE of 9.83%, an equity ratio of 52.56% and an electric rate base of $6.2 billion. The recommendation also included an estimated $51 million of deferrals related to Sherco 3, the Monticello upgrade and pension cost. We estimate these recommended deferrals would have a $34 million impact on our 2013 earnings.","From a pretax earnings perspective, the recommendation is nearly $100 million lower than our most recent revenue requirement request of $259 million, including $50 million of proposed deferral mechanisms.","We recently filed exceptions and clarifications to the ALJ report, which supported many of our initial positions. Specifically, we sought different outcomes on several items that affect the revenue requirement, including the sales forecast and ROE. Deliberations are scheduled for August 6 and 8. The MPUC is expected to vote on many of the key issues at their meeting on August 8 and issue an order in September 2013.","In North Dakota, we are seeking a $16 million rate increase based on a 2013 forecast test year of 10.6% ROE, electric rate base of about $378 million and a 52.56% equity ratio. On July 17, the staff filed direct testimony recommending a rate decrease of $2 million, based largely on a change in cost allocations and ROE. While this is a disappointing recommendation, we are cautiously optimistic that we will ultimately reach a constructive outcome in North Dakota.","In Wisconsin, we recently filed for an electric rate increase of $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of $4.7 million. The requests are based on an ROE of 10.4%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2014 forecasted electric rate base of $895 million and a natural gas rate base of $90 million.","Staff and intervenor testimony is scheduled for October 4. We anticipate a final decision before year end, with the new rates effective in January 2014.","At PSCo, we are seeking a $65 million multi-year gas rate increase covering 2013 to 2015, based on a 10.3% ROE, an equity ratio of 56% and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Rates, subject to refund, will go into effect on August 10. An ALJ recommendation is expected later this month, and a CPUC decision is expected in the third quarter.","Finally, at SPS, in New Mexico, we are seeking a $43.3 million rate request based on a 2014 forecast test year and a 10.65% ROE, rate base of $480 million and an equity ratio of 53.9%. We anticipate a commission decision by year end, with the new rates going into effect during the first quarter of 2014.","I'll now update you on the progress of our 2013 financing plans. During the second quarter, we continue to leverage our strong credit ratings and the low interest rate environment issuing $850 million of debt at favorable rates. At NSP-Minnesota, we issued $400 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds, with a coupon of 2.6%. At the holding company, we issued a $450 million 3-year note at just 75 basis points. The latter financing, combined with the equity proceeds from our first quarter ATM issuance, enabled us to call the $400 million 7 6\/10% holding company junior subordinated note. Based on the successful execution of our financing plans, we now project a $40 million to $45 million decrease in interest expense during 2013.","Looking ahead, we plan to issue $100 million of first mortgage bonds at SPS during the third quarter. Upon completion, the issuance of this SPS bond should wrap up our 2013 financing program. However, financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market condition and other factors.","In closing, we delivered another successful quarter, both financially and operationally. We continue to expect to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $1.85 to $1.95 per share. This is based on strong year-to-date performance, lower interest expense and property taxes, a lower effective tax rate, constructive outcomes in all regulatory proceedings and a final decision in the Minnesota's 2013 electric rate case that is consistent with the ALJ recommendation.","At our Analyst Meeting in December 2011, we discussed the potential for our EPS growth rate to moderate post-2013. This was based on lower rate base growth, sluggish sales and the potential for compression in authorized ROE.","While we remain on track to deliver 2013 earnings consistent within our guidance range, we believe these factors, particularly the lower ROE recommendations we have received in several of our pending rate cases, will make it more challenging to achieve EPS at the upper end of our targeted 5% to 7% range beyond this year.","We are positioned to continue delivering an attractive total return, should earnings growth taper as a result of these factors.","With a payout ratio below 60%, we have the flexibility to grow our dividends at a faster rate than we have in the past. We plan to provide more clarity on our long-term EPS and dividend growth objectives later this year.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, would you please provide instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess I'm not going to -- I won't ask you to articulate your rationale on, sort of, tweaking of the total return expectation because you plan on giving us more meat on that later this year; is that fair?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Greg, if I could, first of all, let me just apologize to everybody on the call. We have significant construction going on outside, and I think that might have interfered with some of the broadcast. I don't know if you could hear it, Greg.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's way in the background. I think you're okay.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Okay. I think we're just reiterating what we've been saying all along, Greg, that after this year, it's likely that our growth rate will modulate a bit as our capital expenditures start to levelize off. And you look at where ROE's are going in the trend and it certainly says that we're probably correct in that, but more to come.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. You obviously have the ability to accelerate growth in the dividend payout ratio, given that it is way below industry average.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Absolutely. And as you and I have talked many times before, Greg, as we went through this construction mode, we wanted to be more conservative with our dividend for a number of reasons. And I think that gives us dry powder in a different -- maybe a unique way that we reward shareholders going forward.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And let me ask you a question with regard to the announcements you've made in the last few days over -- around procuring the 2,000 megawatts wind resources. If you should be successful in procuring the wind at the mix that you are proposing, which is the majority of it being PPAs, some being owned by your utility subs, is that also going to then require you to have to reassess and increase the amount of transmission spend in order to bring all that power to market? And so would that be an ancillary impact of getting that 2,000 megawatts into the portfolio?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","No, it really wouldn't. I mean, we're going to make use of transmission lines and capabilities that are already in place. I think the one issue that we have with the additional 150-megawatt project in North Dakota is making sure that the transmission will be available there at a reasonable cost. And -- but it won't drive any additional major capital expenditures on transmission, Greg.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If you look at post-2013, are you still assuming that O&M growth rate decreases from 4% to 5% to the 3% to 4% O&M range? And what would have to happen for you to get to lower end of that O&M long-term growth rate?","Teresa S. Madden","Neil, this is Teresa. I mean, yes, we're definitely assuming that we will taper down, and we are working on several initiatives that involve productivity improvements, I mean, really across the company. And we do think we'll be able to execute on those that will tend to lower the trend in terms of the overall growth rate.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And can you talk to the timing of the next Minnesota rate case and the next Colorado electric case, when you expect them to be filed and when do you expect the rates to actually going to effect?","Teresa S. Madden","In terms of the next Minnesota rate case, we plan to file later this year for 2014, and we expect it to be a multi-year case. Now whether that will be a 2- or 3-year case, we have not developed all the details on that. In Colorado, as you know on the electric case, we're in a 3-year multi-year, which is '12, '13 and '14. So we would expect to file a case in Colorado for '15 around the middle of 2014.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the last question, Teresa and Ben. We're seeing some strength in weather-normal natural gas sales across the U.S. This is the first time in a long time we've seen this. Is there something structural going on here? It certainly exceeded your forecast this year as well.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Let me chime in and then, Teresa, please add. But I think it's too early to tell. We certainly saw across our board, particularly in this last quarter, significant increase in gas usage. But weather has also been a little bit unusual, too. And sometimes that -- especially when it's up and down within a month, that can create some problems with our weather normalization models. But it's positive trend, and I hope it continues. But I think it's too early to tell. Teresa, you agree with that?","Teresa S. Madden","I totally agree with that. And I think these aberrations in the weather on a shoulder month, as you indicated, we need to watch that.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Travis Miller with MorningStar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could help me clarify one thing in the release Note 2, where you break down the electric margin. You show that $131 million for the first 6 months. I just want to make sure that excludes the $47 million that you've reserved related to Minnesota.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, it's net of it. Correct. It's net.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So at what level does that $131 million suggest in Minnesota? Is that to the $209 million that you've recommended, or does that go down to, say, somewhere around the ALJ ruling, that you're actually recording in earnings?","Teresa S. Madden","I would say -- well, it is around the ALJ.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, great. And then separate subject. When shall we start -- expect to start seeing any kind of financial impact from the Boulder situation, near term or long term?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, Travis, this is Ben. I think what you're seeing right now is some legal costs sort of thing. But as far as the overall impact, are you assuming should Boulder actually municipalize?","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","F","Yes, I'd assume no impact, right, if status quo?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","First of all, you probably wouldn't see the impact of that for, I don't know, 3 to 5 years. And then as we've talked about before, it's -- in the big picture of Xcel Energy, it's not a large portion of our sales. And of course, we would aggressively defend customers outside of Boulder and our own shareholders and making sure we receive the reimbursement that we're entitled to, if they were to municipalize. So I don't think it's going to be a big impact.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glen Rock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just in terms of the [indiscernible] little bit of a flavor in terms of if you were to boost your payout, would you guys be thinking of doing it in sort of a growth over multiple years or sort of as a step function, just move it up depending, of course, what the growth outlook is? Do know what I'm saying, just philosophically? I mean I know the board decides it. But do you know what I'm sort of saying? I mean, in some cases, you see an actual, sort of, like, hey, we're going to change it here or it's sort of like, you know what, we're just going to accelerate the growth of the dividend.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. Paul, at this point, I can't give you any more flavor to that than we've already said. And more to come on that as the year progresses, and we get more input into what our expenditures are going to be and all the other factors that you consider with the board to your point in making a dividend recommendation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. In terms of the sales growth, the 0% to 0.5%, going down from 0.5%, is that weather adjusted, or is that just because of what you see in terms of the weather so far this year?","Teresa S. Madden","It's weather adjusted.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then in terms of -- you're mentioning these rate cases. I'm just sort of wondering, in terms of your sales growth forecast longer term, could you give us a flavor maybe just for at least Minnesota or Colorado sort of what the long-term growth forecast is? And with respect to Minnesota and the multi-year plan, is there a -- you mentioned O&M and other factors. But if the sales fluctuates, would that potentially also be adjusted under the multi-year plan that Minnesota is looking into here?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think, Paul, I think, there's a lot of more to come on that. I mean, as I've said in my remarks, the parties are seeking clarification. And even with clarification, I think that those are the kind of elements that become part of the discussion on how we would go forward. I mean, just as an FYI, sales in Minnesota are not very strong, and they're tracking pretty much to our expectations. We didn't expect it to be a strong year, and that's the way it's turning out. So whether or not there would be true-up mechanisms or you would just live with it remains to be seen in the 3-year plan. But...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I understand. It's early days. But just in general, how should we think about the sales growth, let's say -- I mean, as you mentioned, I mean, you guys have a big -- you guys have a wide geographical reach. What is sort of the look -- what is the sales growth longer term with everything that you know so far, obviously, versus Minnesota, versus Colorado, for instance, or your other jurisdictions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I would say that Minnesota is probably the most sluggish and we're seeing the most declines. And then, I would say that Colorado is about flat, and we are seeing the strongest growth in actually SPS and NSP-Wisconsin.","Teresa S. Madden","I would agree with that. Over the next 5 years, maybe just as rule of thumb, our growth we're projecting to be at, consolidated, up to 1%. But Ben is actually -- he's very correct in terms of Minnesota, we're seeing the most erosion in sales.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, obviously, we've got the situation in Boulder, but Minneapolis also seems to be looking into this. Is this just coincidence that these guys are -- or is there any sort of trend here in terms of municipalization? Could you just give us a little bit of a flavor as to -- this is a sort of local politics sort of situation or is there something else going on?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think each city is unique, but we do live in communities that very much want to advance their Clean Energy agenda. As you know, Paul, we're very much advanced in the Clean Energy agenda, but we're doing so with economics and price point in mind. There's actually, today, a public hearing on the municipalization discussion in Minneapolis. And they will -- there'll be a vote, I believe, on August 16, by the Council as to whether or not to put this out for public vote in November. The issue is that the city has a climate action plan. We're actually ahead of many of the goals that the climate action plan calls for. We'll have a 30% carbon reduction in the upper Midwest by 2020. So we're just going -- I think at the end of the day, we're going to sit down, work with the city. And I think everybody recognizes the cost and risks and -- the enormous cost for Minneapolis to go forward with something like that. So it is an election year. It has been an issue that's been brought to the attention, and it's gotten a lot of media play. And we look forward to working with the communities, the cities, the stakeholder groups. And we've been a partner for 100 years; I suspect we'll be a partner in Minneapolis for another 100 years. In terms of Boulder, that's farther along. And while I think the -- I don't think it would benefit the customers, we will find out more. The city had a -- the first readout on this in July, wasn't it, Teresa?","Teresa S. Madden","Right.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","And there'll be another vote on that also in August, whether or not they proceed with condonation proceedings. Again, that's a long process. There'll be another vote in November on debt [indiscernible] to how much all this would cost, and I think there still continues to be work on how we could work with this city and avoid municipalization. But it is what it is, and -- but stepping back to answer your question on a more macro level, we're going to -- I think it's important in this world that we continue to offer more choice to citizens, communities, cities, and we're going to continue to do that. Look for us to do more of that. But also look for us to do that in a way that's fair to people -- to all citizens, all communities and all cities. And that's a really important principle. And so sometimes, I'm talking maybe too much here, Paul, but sometimes we're the middle-of-the-road kind of people where we try to do things that are reasonable and smart, and sometimes you get hit by traffic on both sides of the road when you do that. But I think it's the right way to go for our customers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Can you just -- you started off in your remarks regarding the wind and then just going to the conversation regarding people wanting to see more renewables. My first question is, utilities all around are now buying either solar or wind for tax purposes and other stuff. That's also another new thing, which, of course, you can't utilize, I guess, for the reasons. But why bid out these PPAs? Why not build ourself, because that is what the constituents and everyone wants? Why give this capital away to someone else who would utilize our balance sheet and credit ratings? Why not, Ben, be more aggressive in being this wholly owned and for our own self, for our own shareholders, rather than bidding it out? That's question #1. Question #2 is what you mentioned on the Slide 2, is this incorporated? You are mentioning even in North Dakota some wind plant. Is this all incorporated in the 5-year CapEx, I guess, which I have from the beginning of the year? Is that incorporated in the CapEx numbers or not? 2 different questions.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","To answer your second question, it's not.","Teresa S. Madden","That's correct.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","So that would be incremental capital spend. To answer your first question, which is far more complicated, obviously. Obviously, we have a process that we need to go through, Ashar. And we need to justify what is the right decision for our customers to our commissions, as we should. We like to build more, but you have to recognize that -- not unlike when you make a decision to buy a car. If you're going to hold that car for a long time, almost always it's a better decision to build. But as you know, your initial monthly payments would be higher and ownership versus a lease. So we're trying to seek a blend that allows for ownership, which we do think over the long term has a better long-term value for our customers, but also blend it in with PPAs that have that levelized cost. And I think we're seeking the right balance there. And I suppose we could be more aggressive, but I will tell you, the important thing in my mind is that we get these deals done and our customers save $1 billion of fuel over the next 20 years. And while we might not get the direct benefit of that, I think benefiting our customers will always come back to benefit us.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then how much -- can you just elaborate if you are successful to what you said this morning, how much of additional CapEx is that, please?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Do you want to take that, Teresa?","Teresa S. Madden","Sure. Well, in terms of this, if we just have one, we could be around the $350 million; at 2 would be potentially closer to $600 million.","Ashar Khan","And that would be in the next 2 years, Teresa, is that the right frame, 2014, '15?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, minimal spend this year. Most of it is in '15.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Ashar, that's also based on just kind of taking an average dollar per kilowatt times the 200 megawatts. That's an estimate. It's not necessarily indicative of the actual price.","Teresa S. Madden","Right.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then, if I can just conceptually understand the Minnesota case. When is a decision on the multi-year plan? Ben, you mentioned you're going to have a decision later this year; what is the timeframe of that? Is that September, October or something like that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, they already came out and stepped the framework for a multi-year plan, Ashar. The additional clarifications will be later this year. I don't think there's any set timeframe. But we anticipate we'll get that clarification prior to filing of 2014 rate case, which would include a multi-year proposal.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So if I look -- as you mentioned in your 8-K earlier and today also, weather and all those things helped us to be able to be within the guidance range, assuming the Minnesota PUC rules next weeks or so in line with the ALJ. So am I correct then for next year, we will probably have interim rates in effect starting beginning of the year or so. The impact of any -- whatever the commission's decision is really doesn't have a follow-through effect going forward next year, because the interim rates should be effect from the beginning of the year, and we should be able to be asking for what they didn't give us this time into that next filing; is that a clear way to think of it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I would say it's partially correct. The -- there's a -- first of all, we have to file for interim rates and we would -- we have been receiving interim rates. But there's some limitations on what you can base your interim rate request on, Ashar. So -- and I've got Teresa and Scott here. I think it could have some impact. But the concept that you speak to is generally correct. So to the extent, as we've mentioned, that we have deferral mechanisms, those deferral mechanisms this year will fall right into '14 and would be part of our overall rate request in 2014.","Teresa S. Madden","It could. And if, for example, the commission's order is different than the ALJ, that could also affect the change in terms of the level of what we're requesting in '14.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then, if I can end up...","Paul A. Johnson","Ashar, we've got several other people on the lines, I think we're going to have to move on. And if you want other questions, go back and we'll get you at the end.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I did just want to hear a little bit about what you all are seeing in terms of economics for wind projects these days and as you look out sort of in the latest data points that you're seeing. And as you think about the PTC extension versus not being extended, how that would factor in to the volumes, to the outlook for wind growth?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think it's -- I can't speak to whether or not it's sustainable, but we're seeing phenomenal pricing on wind, Stephen. And enough so that when we price of these things out, you can just make these things work economically on a fuel basis. So today, we could not lock into a 20-year strip of natural gas, with an assumed heat rate for less than we can lock in on wind projects for 20 years. So we're talking about prices, depending on the jurisdiction, in that $25 to $35 kind of megawatt per hour range. That's phenomenal. And of course, if I were to lock in a 20-year strip with natural gas, I wouldn't get any of the capacity value. And while we don't plan for wind because I have a big capacity value, so the economics aren't really based on its capacity. I can tell you what our analysis is showing is that in some of the peakiest, warmest summer days, the wind is blowing. And so we are getting capacity value out of it. So this is just, in my opinion, a home run for our customers. And we're happy to do it. And I think the other thing we've got going for us is that we were in a position where we didn't have to take any of these bids. So we were not a price taker; we could be a price maker. And again, that'll benefit our customers. And I think in the long run, anything that benefits our customersbenefits shareholders, provided it's not a little over ROE.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood, understood. And maybe just conceptually on ROEs more broadly, as we think about your ROE position now and the timing of your rate case, I guess, at a big picture, sort of thinking about the movements in interest rates since the last -- in the last several months. And as you look at the ROEs here and you look at them the way that the jurisdictions are calculating ROEs, is this sort of -- should we think of this potentially as a trough in the sense that rates have been increasing since then, mechanically, would -- the timing would appear to have been a trough relative to where we are today as you look out at where interest rates are headed? Or is that not a fair characterization?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think interest rates rising could -- would be supportive of your trough issue. There's other factors that go into that. But I think -- as you probably know, I think there's a notional amount of return that investors want as well. So again, Teresa or Scott, if you want to comment on that?","Teresa S. Madden","No, I mean, I agree with the premise as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. Ben, one is in the earnings release, when you talk about keeping to your guidance, you talk about the favorable weather, and then you talk about certain other items as well. Can you just remind us what are those certain other items, and what favorable impact they are giving you?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","How about if I turn that over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, Ali, if you look at the, actually, the specific earnings guidance items, a number of them we have changed that are favorable. And the key ones are property taxes, AFUDC equity, interest expense and the lower effective tax rate. So a combination of all of those are the certain other items.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I got it. Okay. And then also in Minnesota, you're going through this big rate case right now and, right on the heels of that, the multi-year rate case is coming. And can you talk a little bit about the sensitivity in terms of the timing of one big case ending and the next one starting? And we heard some ramblings from the commission that they're not too happy with that. Just wanted to get your perspective.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","We certainly understand that concern and that criticism, and it's -- there's a lot of things coming at once. Our nuclear investment for the next 20 years is a big part of that. But there's a whole host of things that we are investing in to make sure that we are prepared for the future and have a resilient distribution system, have the right amount of transmission. So there's a lot coming. I do think it starts to levelize off. So I think that dialogue, hopefully, we can have, is how we can make sure that we get adequate recovery of those investments but also be responsive to the pace of the regulatory filings that we're making. So more to come on that. We understand the issue. We understand that everybody wants this capital we spend, and we have to work with stakeholders, the commission, their staff, to figure out the best way forward. I think a multi-year framework is a good place to start with that. That gives us an opportunity to, I think, do some longer-range planning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question, as we look at the results so far, perhaps either on an LTM basis or based in the '13 guidance, can you remind us in which jurisdiction are you seeing the biggest regulatory lag right now?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","It would be at our SPS jurisdictions, where we don't have forward test years.","Teresa S. Madden","Exactly.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","South Dakota.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, it's wherever we have a historical test year. SPS, we're doing -- Texas, we're doing better but it's still the biggest lag, continues to be.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And the best performing from a lag perspective or lack of lag perspective would be?","Teresa S. Madden","Colorado, Colorado Electric.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean, Ali, one of the things you'll notice is we had an earnings test in Colorado, and we had a refund back to customers, which tells you that we're slightly earning above our authorized return in 2013 for Colorado.","Teresa S. Madden","In '12.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","'12. Excuse me, I meant in '12.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, my first question has to do with the 5% to 7% growth rate. For what period of -- or out to what period of time does that 5% to 7% apply?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, as I tried to indicate, at least, in my comments that clearly, it's applying to '13. We expect that to continue. After we get past '13, because of all the factors like pressure on ROEs, we could see that moderating down some. But more to come because we're in the middle of rate cases right now, and there's several other factors.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So when you were talking about being in the low end of that range, that would only apply to '13 then?","Teresa S. Madden","We said -- I talked about after '13, not being able to achieve the high end of the 5% to 7%.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question would be, what is the PSIA portion of the increase request that you have in Colorado? So in other words, if you just strip out the PSIA piece for '13, how much is that?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, it's $26 million, $27 million.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me is, what's driving the increase in AFUDC relative to your guidance? Is it that you're accelerating the amount of your investment? Or is the AFUDC rate higher than what you were assuming?","Teresa S. Madden","It really has to do -- it's the construction timing and the amount of it. It's the combination of those and how much short-term debt we have outstanding. In terms of less short-term debt, it tends to drive up the AFUDC rate, the equity rate. And so that -- those are the biggest drivers.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment.","Dan Jenkins","I just had a couple of questions related to this Minnesota multi-year plan. So is it -- I guess, I'm wondering, a lot of other states, they've had to pass legislation to implement this type of thing. Is there -- is the current utility legislation fully compliant with implementing the multi-year plan or get some parties...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","No, we've already had that pass through the legislative process.","Teresa S. Madden","And the commission is just buying...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","So the mechanics were -- for the commission to determine, and that's what the -- it did earlier this year, they just established the framework.","Dan Jenkins","So -- and then, do you expect this to be in place, then, prior to your 2014 case, you said; is that correct?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","The framework is in place, so -- I mean, it is in place. And as you go through this the first time, there's always going to be questions about the mechanics and some of the more detailed rule -- rulings within. And that's the process we're in right now.","Dan Jenkins","So do you see it working similar to how they do it in Wisconsin or can you give us a little more...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Wisconsin is by statue, is you file it every 2 years. So this, I think, would be a little bit different in that you can have a longer period of time, there's different rules. And you've got capital and some O&M costs that you can recover in potentially the second and third years.","Teresa S. Madden","Right. If you file that all initially in Minnesota, where Wisconsin you come in every other year, but you have to reopen her.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Right.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Yes, I guess, it's a timing question. Ben, you guys have always given us, like, the next year's guidance on the third quarter call. So is it fair that we should get this new growth rate and guidance on the third quarter call?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, I mean, we'll have a number of opportunities. We've done it in the third quarter. I think we've done it at EEI. We've done it at different times. But we will definitely keep you updated as this thing develops.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions. I will turn the call back to Ms. Teresa. Please go ahead.","Teresa S. Madden","We appreciate your participation in our second quarter earnings call. Please call Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions. And thanks.","Benjamin G. S.

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Johnson","Thank you. Welcome to Xcel Energy's second quarter 2012 earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller.","Today, we will provide you with an update on recent business developments, discuss second quarter results, and update you on our 2012 guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany today's call which are available on our webpage. In addition, we will also post a short video at our website with Teresa Madden summarizing our results. We encourage you to check it out. As a reminder, some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to, Ben.","Ben Fowke","Thanks, Paul and good morning. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.38 per share compared with $0.33 per share in 2011. New electric rates in Colorado, combined with warmer than normal June weather across our service territory and continued strong expense control, led to our solid second quarter results.","As a result, we remain on track to deliver 2012 earnings in the lower half of our earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Teresa will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance in greater detail in a few moments.","I will now provide you a few recent developments, starting with an operational update. I am pleased to report that our operating systems performed very well throughout the recent period of hot weather across our service territory. Record temperatures drove new peak demands in several states with only minimal service interruptions.","In addition to the record heat, numerous severe storms occurred in our northern service territory. Excellent response, planning and performance during system outage events minimized customer impacts and our crew has performed their work safely under difficult conditions.","In addition to reliability, our efforts to provide value to our customers are also reflected in two recently proposed transactions. This summer, we agreed to purchase the Brush assets for $75 million. The Brush assets consist of three gas-fired generating units with a total capacity of 237 megawatts. These plants currently provide energy and capacity to PSCo under purchase power agreements that are set to expire in 2017 and 2022.","While smaller, this transaction is very similar to our acquisition of generation assets from Calpine in late 2010 which provided benefits to both customers and investors. The Brush acquisition has many positive attributes including saving our customers' money beginning in the first year. Additionally, owning these peaking plants will give us greater control over our resources. Purchase is subject to various regulatory approvals including the Colorado Commission. We anticipate this transaction will close in early 2013.","We have also asked the commission to consider our request to retire at the end of 2013 Arapahoe unit 4, a 109 megawatt coal-fired power plant. Previously we planned to switch this unit to natural gas. We have proposed replacing the retired unit with a PPA.","One final item, before I turn the call over to Teresa. As you know, in December 2011, NSP-Minnesota filed a request to defer incremental 2012 property taxes or alternatively that a property tax rider be approved. In June, the Minnesota Commission voted to deny our request for deferred accounting for incremental property taxes and also denied our request for property tax rider.","Despite our disappointment in their decision, we believe the regulatory compact in Minnesota remains constructive. We felt our circumstances merited deferred accounting treatment, however the Commission ultimately ruled that this request did not meet the strict requirements for a deferral. As a result, we will continue to expense the full $24 million of incremental property taxes in 2012 resulting in a drag of approximately $0.03 per share on our 2012 earnings.","Now we considered accelerating the filing of our 2013 Minnesota electric rate case so that we could implement interim rates in late 2012 to help offset the impact of increased property taxes, lower sales and added investments in Minnesota, however, based on our continued success, managing O&M expenses and with the help from warmer than normal weather in June and July, we decided to continue our plans which anticipate a Minnesota electric rate case filing in early November.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa Madden","Thanks, Ben and good morning. Today, I will discuss second quarter results, provide an update on our regulatory calendar, discuss our financing plan and update you on our 2012 earnings guidance. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter results at each of our four operating companies.","Earnings at PSCo increased $0.05 per share for the second quarter, due primarily to an electric rate increase, effective in May 2012, lower O&M expenses and warmer June weather. The increases were partially offset by decreased wholesale revenue due to the exploration of a long-term power agreement with Black Hills Corporation.","Earnings at NSP-Minnesota were flat for the quarter. SPS earnings increased $0.01 per share for the second quarter. New rate increases in New Mexico and Texas, effective in January 2012, were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and property taxes.","Second quarter earnings at NSP-Wisconsin decreased $0.01 per share, due to higher O&M expenses, partially offset by rate increases effective in January 2012 and warmer summer weather.","I will now discuss some of the key drivers that affected the income statement, beginning with the retail electric margin. Our second quarter electric margin increased $44 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were $25 million from new rate increases in several states but most significantly in Colorado and $21 million from estimated impact of weather.","These positive items were partially offset by lower firm's wholesale revenues due to the exploration of a long-term agreement with Black Hills Corporation and other less significant item. Our quarterly weather normalized retail electric sales grew 0.5% having a negligible positive impact on electric margin.","Year-to-date weather normalized retail electric sales grew 0.004%. However, weather normalized sales actually declined 0.002% when you remove the benefit of one additional day of sales due to leap year. We continue to forecast flat sales growth for 2012.","Turning to expenses. We continue to successfully manage O&M expenses in an effort to help offset some of the headwinds we faced in 2012. We began implementing O&M reduction initiatives in January to help offset the impact of the lower than forecasted sales, warm winter weather and the denial of our request for interim rates in Colorado.","As a result of these efforts, our O&M expenses were essentially flat on both quarterly and year-to-date basis. We continue to forecast 2012 O&M expenses increase up to 1%. This compares to our original expectation for a 3% to 4% increase, however, continued warm weather may put upward pressure on our O&M targets.","Other taxes increased approximately $7.1 million or 7.7% largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota, following the denial of our deferred accounting request. As a reminder, we are deferring incremental property taxes in Colorado as a result of our recently approved multiyear plan.","I will now provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. In June, NSP-Wisconsin filed a request to increase electric rates by $39.1 million or 6.7% and to increase natural gas rates by $5.3 million or 4.9%. New rates are expected to be effective in January 2013.","The electric rate filing was based on a 2013 forecast test year, 10.4% ROE, and equity ratio of 52.5% and an averaged 2013 electric rate base of approximately $790 million. The natural gas request was solely due to a proposal to recover the initial costs associated with the environmental MGP cleanup in Ashland. A commission decision is anticipated during the fourth quarter of 2012.","In June 2011, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission to increase South Dakota electric rates by $14.6 million, effective in 2012. The request was based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes, a return on equity of 11%, a rate base of $323 million and an equity ratio of 52.48%.","In June 2012, the South Dakota Commission authorized a rate increase of approximately $8 million, based on an ROE of 9.25%, and equity ratio of 53% and full cost recovery for the Nobles Wind Project which had been a contested issue in the proceedings.","We are clearly disappointed in the authorized ROE granted in South Dakota. Nevertheless, we will continue to seek improved returns and to that end we filed a 2012 electric rate case in South Dakota in late June, requesting a $19.4 million increase in electrical rate.","The request is based on a 2011 historic test year, adjusted for known and measurable changes for 2012 and 2013, a 10.65% ROE, a 53% equity ratio and a rate base of about $370 million. We anticipate a commission ruling in late 2012 or early 2013 with rates effective in early 2013.","One last rate related proceeding I want to mention is our request for approval of our investment in SmartGridCity in Colorado. As part of this 2010 electric rate case, PSCo requested recovery of the revenue requirements associated with our $45 million capital investments and $4 million of annual O&M costs incurred to develop and operate our SmartGrid project in Boulder. In early 2011, the Colorado Commission allowed partial recovery of the project, totaling approximately $28 million of the capital cost and all of the O&M costs.","In December 2011, PSCo requested Commission approval for the recovery of the remaining capital investment in SmartGrid. A decision is expected in the third quarter of 2012. The decision will not change the terms of the multiyear plan but would provide assurance of future recovery of these costs.","Looking ahead, we continue to consider plans to file several additional rate cases in the second half of 2012 including electric rate cases in North Dakota, Texas, New Mexico and our Colorado gas case.","In addition, in November we plan to file an electric rate case in Minnesota based on 2013 test year. This would allow for the implementation of interim rates in January. We will then consider options for pursing a multiyear rate plan similar to what we achieved in Colorado. The Minnesota Commission is considering a process to establish parameters for such a plan and we intend to actively participate.","I would now like to update you on our financing plans for the remainder of 2012. In July 2012, we entered into amended five-year credit agreements with a syndicate of banks, replacing the previous four-year credit agreement. The amended credit agreements have substantially the same terms and conditions, however, with an improvement in pricing and extension of maturity from March 2015 to July 2017.","Our 2012 financing program continues as planned. During the second quarter, we issued $100 million of first mortgage bonds at SPS. This quarter, we plan to issue $800 million of first mortgage bonds at both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo.","We also plan to issue approximately $100 million of first mortgage bonds at NSP-Wisconsin during the second half of the year. Financing plans are subject to change depending upon capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors.","In a challenging year marked by warm winter weather, tepid electric sales and some regulatory decisions that worked against us, we are proud of our efforts designed to deliver 2012 EPS within our guidance range.","Taking early measures to reduce O&M expense and securing approval of the multiyear plan in Colorado, demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver on our financial objective. Since 2005, we have established a strong track record and we remain committed to delivering 2012 earnings within our guidance range.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar Security Research. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Security Research","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go a little more into the usage patterns that you are seeing on weather adjustment basis, the flat, and what you guys have booked so far in terms of usage growth. Which jurisdictions are you seeing more positive weather adjusted usage signs? Which more negative? Then to the extent that you might be seeing the DSM in conservation programs affecting that, do you think you are fully realizing the lost margin through those riders that you have?","Ben Fowke","Those are all great questions. Let me just try to answer your first question. I think the strongest sales that we are seeing are at SPS, based upon the energy related businesses they had down there. We are also seeing on the C&I sides, some pretty good pick up in Wisconsin.","Again, that's energy-related, but in this case, it's more sand mining, which has really become quite the business in that part of Wisconsin. I think we are seeing some growth in the last quarter with PSCo and in Colorado. Again, I think that's primarily energy-related.","Then when you move to Minnesota, it's been pretty sluggish across the board in both the C&I and residential class and, Travis, just as a broad stroke we are adding residential customers, but the residential usage is definitely less per household than it has been in the past","So that's something we are watching very closely, and maybe that segues into your second part of your question, it was the impact of DSM. It's been pretty attractive for us, but we do believe that shades off 70, 80 basis points on our sales growth expectation, and I guess the thing that we continue to analyze is whether or not there's a shadow effect to that that perhaps we are not getting compensated for, but it's certainly in Minnesota, it's pushing us in the rate cases pretty quickly.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Security Research","Imagine that's one of the key issues I think coming up in November. You will address usage?","Ben Fowke","We have tend to miss forecast what sales are going to be. We have been too optimistic. So, we will have to make sure that we temper that optimism coming into this rate case.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","On the Minnesota regulatory process. Teresa, you mentioned the Commission is working on process that would give some clarity on how a multiyear plan would work. Is that how to think of it? Can you give us some color on that?","Teresa Madden","You are thinking of that correctly, and in fact they are going to have a preliminarily discussion about that today. So, that's exactly right. It's not just for us, but it's for all utilities.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Would you expect that then they would give you some pretty specific ideas that well here you could file, say for a three-year rate deal, How should we think of what to expect from what they are doing now?","Teresa Madden","Well, Kit, it's early to say exactly what would come out of that. Our plan right now is to file the one-year and then pursue like we did in Colorado, ultimately a multiyear, potentially as just part of that as we move forward in that case.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Any idea on when they would have some specifics on multiyear rate making?","Teresa Madden","Comments are due in October and we will just proceed through the process in the fourth quarter.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Obviously that should be available some sort of feedback from the commission should be available before you file that rate case?","Teresa Madden","Could be, but our plans as I indicated Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","In Colorado, I think the idea was when you got the three-year deal that and that would help you to manage to the revenue outlook that you saw then. Can you give us some idea of how the Colorado business is going in terms of achieving allowed our ROE and what the prospect for that is, going forward?","Teresa Madden","As you recall we have the 10% parameter and we will share above that but we are feeling good that this is going to provide sufficient revenue release in terms of meeting our objective.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Great, thank you.","Teresa Madden","Thanks.","Ben Fowke","Kit. I guess I would add that all of our jurisdictions with the exception of Minnesota probably are going to be in the mid 9s ROE this year. Minnesota will not be in the 9s which is reason why we have filed in rate case. I think it's off the line.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","When you talk about managing your O&M cost and regionally thought that would be a 3% to 4% escalation, looking at 1% or so, how much of that is a permanent reduction in O&M? How much is sort of timing and temporary? How should we think about O&M going forward from an escalation perspective?","Teresa Madden","Ali, in terms of O&M, just in general, as we go through the year, we have variations, we move projects around. In terms of the longer term, we would expect to be more around 3% potentially 4% range increases. So, this year as we said 0% to 1% and we would expect to get back on track to 3% to 4% next year and in the future after that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Then secondly, could you remind us if you used 12 as a base in terms of your rate base currently across the portfolio and look at the CapEx that you have budgeted for the next four to five years, what's the underlying annualized rate base growth that CapEx is supporting starting from a 12 base?","Teresa Madden","Ali, it's less than seven around six or so.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","That is, Teresa, using 12 as a base, right?","Teresa Madden","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay, and last question Ben, you alluded to the fact you are going to be earning, mid 9% across every jurisdiction other than Minnesota, remind us what's embedded in for Minnesota this year and that's these are ROEs at the utility right, we are not talking any corporate leverage, et cetera on top of that?","Ben Fowke","I was talking about utility ROEs and then I think Minnesota will probably be in the 8% range. I mean, obviously losing $24 million in property tax hurts. Sales have been continued sluggish in Minnesota. So that's the reason why it's the laggard.","Teresa Madden","I would add to that Ali, at a consolidate basis we expect to see just slightly above 10%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","But that's again at the corporate?","Teresa Madden","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And, you have been talking about the lower end of the range, but you have also been talking about better weather et cetera, is there a scenario that you could actually go to the higher end of the range as the year progresses or is it given where we are, that's probably not realistic?","Ben Fowke","Ali, we have given you the best short of where we see it now. Clearly, July, we haven't closed the books on July, but weather has been favorable in July. We have some more regulatory proceedings to go through and we will keep watching the sales. So, I think we will be in good position to update you better in the third quarter, which is typically when we refine our estimates anyway because that's our earnings season. So, stay tuned.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Paul Fremont - Jeffries","First question I have is with South Dakota, what sort of drove their decision for that level of ROE and if South Dakota's coming in low, does that that have an effect on sort of the surrounding states and their way of thinking about ROE?","Ben Fowke","Well, I would just have to tell you, we totally disagree with the ROE that we were given and it pushes us right away to filing a rate case. Again, as Teresa mentioned, and, it's an historic test here, so you have got lag on top of that and it is disturbing to us.","Clearly, we want to see it get better. If it doesn't get better, we will have to figure out what we were going to do going forward, because I mean your question is a good one, capital needs to go where it's being rewarded.","Right now, I think it was unintentional signal, but I think the South Dakota Commission is saying, we don't want you to spend money on the infrastructure. That's certainly when you get that kind of return, that's what it's telling you.","Teresa Madden","We just to add in terms of your question about influencing our other jurisdictions which seems to be at that same level, obviously there is pressure on ROEs all over. Do we see that in Minnesota or North Dakota to that degree? Not to that degree, outside of just normal pressures on ROE.","Paul Fremont - Jeffries","Then I guess my second question is, how does the Minnesota decision on the tax recovery impact your strategy for future settlements? Because obviously under the settlement, the parties I think were amenable to allowing you to recovery those costs, but you still got shot down by the commission, so I mean does that make it more difficult to settle?","Ben Fowke","Well, the staff didn't sign-off on that. So ideally we would have staff sign-off. So, we will have to work harder on that going forward. Settlements still make a lot of sense. We did that in Colorado and we will continue to try to do things like that in Minnesota, but we were clearly disappointed.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Just going back to the Minnesota comments and kind of in the nature of a slower growth environment, what elements do you think can be most important to get it a multiyear structure done as you lay out a plan with the commission?","Ben Fowke","Well, the benefits of a multiyear plan from a customer perspective is certainty. It\u2019s just a great opportunity to talk about the infrastructure refresh challenge, the need for that, lay that out with stakeholders, get them to understand and have them understand what the rate impact is to them and I don't think that goes away in a low sales environment or high sales environment. I just like the transparency.","Now on our end, clearly when we know what our revenues is going to be in the next three years, I think it positions you better to manage your O&M, manage your capital budgets and manage through your revenue expectations. So I think it works for both. Hopefully that answers your question. Does it?","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I guess you had a long lines of of what sort of your mechanisms you think need to be in place as far as kind of revenue protection at the lower volume to offset the higher rate of O&M cost inflation and property tax and things like that?","Ben Fowke","There are so many other things there are give and takes, if you can agree on what the sales are going to be, one of the things you could do is have some kind of true-up mechanism may be a band like we did down in Colorado where if it gets at roads pass a certain point or we don't achieve a certain point, you have some kind of mechanism if it\u2019s extreme.","That\u2019s part of the settlement process but typically if both parties see it differently. There\u2019s an opportunity to compromise on some mechanism that doesn\u2019t create a windfall or hurt anybody.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I guess one other questions is on transmission investment, what opportunities are you guys have seen within the region as the EPA rules come into effect and we expects to see more coal plant retirement announcement in MISOs that open more windows of those spending from what\u2019s in the plan right now?","Ben Fowke","I don't know if it\u2019s going to do that much through transmission, the retirements. To answer your question, the opportunities for transmission investment are enormous in all of our territories and the upper Midwest is no exception. It happens to be where we are further along in the development of those plants and we are going to spend, what is it Teresa, close to $4 billion over the next five years?","Teresa Madden","Right, that's correct, out of our $13 billion budget. So it's a pretty robust budget right now.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Michael Bates with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson","On your guidance, as you talk about the rider revenue expected to be $35 million to $45 million higher than last year, do you have the number as far as where you're at mid-year?","Ben Fowke","Michael, can you restate the question? You were breaking up a little bit there?","Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson","Sure. I was wondering, in your guidance you assumed that rider recovery is $35 million to $45 million higher than it was in 2011. I'm wondering do you have the number to kind of show us where you are at mid-year?","Teresa Madden","Well, I would say we are on track. The biggest variation in terms of the variance is due to the PSIA, the new rider in Colorado related to gas infrastructure investment. So, nothing different in terms of our assumptions from prior quarters around that, so we are not seeing any necessary updates from where we have been.","Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson","Then going back to your comments on the Brush Power assets and I am sorry if I missed this earlier, but when do you expect to put those into PSCo's rate base?","Ben Fowke","We expect the transaction to close in the early part of next year.","Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson","You would expect it to immediately go into the retail rate base then upon closing?","Ben Fowke","Typically, remember, it's under a PPA right now. So embedded in our rates right now is the capacity recovery.","Operator","Thank you and there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Teresa for any closing comments.","Teresa Madden","I want to thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, Paul Johnson and the IR team are available to take your calls. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Johnson","Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 year-end earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions as needed. This morning, we will review our 2015 results, and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. In addition, we'll post a brief video of Teresa summarizing financial results later this morning.","In addition, we recently launched an IR, Investor Relations app, so you can download for free in the app store. The app allows you to uses the mobile devices conveniently access our Investor Relations material.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ben.","Benjamin Fowke","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy delivering an ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. We also increase the dividend 6.7%, and raise the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. And this marks to 12th consecutive annual dividend increase.","Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most of the utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello prudence review.","In 2015, we continued to pursue multi-year compacts, which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second three-year plan in Colorado, and we followed a comprehensive multi-year plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag.","In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plant advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves the liability while ensuring customer benefits and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received.","In 2015, we continued to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 miles to 80 miles per hour, a low zero windshield, wide out conditions and inaccessible roads to the 6 foot to 10 foot snow drifts.","Now, even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. This remarkable fee was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event, and of course our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays.","Our industry leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us their Emergency Recovery Award for our response to a severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers, just last summer.","In 2015, our employees not only provided best in class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety, resulting in an a eighth consecutive best year ever.","Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy, and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without an injury. Clearly, we believe there is a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity.","We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200 megawatt Courtenay wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year-end ahead of schedule and on budget.","Moving to 2016, earlier this week, the PSCO filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments and natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices, with a long-term benefit of our customers.","The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach with decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for a potential investment, assuming it is beneficial of our customers.","It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made. But having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment per rate basing of natural gas reserves is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast.","Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high-level impact of the extenders' bills. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive, despite some reduction in the rate base growth and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act or rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. This is due to multi-year plans and the existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions.","Second, beyond the 2018 timeframe, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe, it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investments.","Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITCs favorably, as it makes large scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident and in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4% to 6% EPS growth objective.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?","Teresa Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. My comments today will focus on full year 2015 results. We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management actions to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes, allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range.","The following key drivers positively impacted earnings; electric rate increases in riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado, and reduce O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share, compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather condition. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense, as well as lower AFUDC.","Turning to sales, our weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%.","The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016.","Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sales.","Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers, but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.002 in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%.","As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team refunded by reducing costs to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitments depending the cost curve, and meeting our financial objective.","Now, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the Commission rules in our Colorado natural gas rate case, while a written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results. We wanted to give you a high level overview of the verbal decision.","The Commission largely approved the ALJ recommended decisions with a couple of changes. Key decisions include a single year rate plan versus our request for a multi-year plan, a three year extension of the PSIA prior, and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have signed fully analyzed the results.","In our Texas electric rate case, the Commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million, compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. The Commission decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include rejection as SPS's request for post test-year capital addition. This allow us of SPS's proposed known and measureable adjustment for updated allocation factor between customer classes related to low reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015. This allowance of incentive compensation and a reduction in the equity ratio.","We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the earned ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. We have filed [indiscernible] hearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions at the recently passed legislation designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for a inclusion of post-test year capital additions, timelier implementation of the new rates, and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investments. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcomes in the upcoming case.","In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission approved the decision on our proposed 2017 interim rates and indicated NSP Minnesota could resubmit its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedure schedule has been established which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we had outlined the path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the timeline to reach the resolution in the case.","Next, I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed five-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our Analyst Meeting in December, we provided our updated five-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate case CAGR by approximately 70 basis points to 80 basis points resulting in the rate base growth of about 3.7% for our base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate-based growth, it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investments.","At our Analyst Meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan, distribution grid modernization and natural gas reserves in Colorado. In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunities. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investments having a reasonable probability of coming fruition over the next five years.","The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the five year of timeframe results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5% including the impact of bonus deprecation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunity and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension.","In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year, we increased our dividend for the 12th straight year, we initiated cost management actions, which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses, new legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory risk, we resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reduction, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share.","Finally, we are well positioned to deliver on our value proposition, which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%.","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin Fowke","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning, Ben, Teresa. As you mentioned in 2015 on an ongoing basis, the OpCo, are we weather normalized 9.07%. Can you just remind us what the weighted average authorized ROE is just to get a sense of what is the lag as we've exited 2015? And then what's baked into earned ROE in your 2016 guidance?","Teresa Madden","Well, we'll start with the weighted average, in terms of authorized ROEs, it's about 9.8%. And when we look to 2016, we see three of our utilities earning right around the 9%, low 9% and some of them little stronger than that. I will say we have some lag in Texas, our Texas or the SD company, somewhat related to \u2013 what came out of that case. But you know we're filing a new case. And so, we do still see \u2013 think we're on target to achieve our 50-basis point closure by 2018, Ali.","Ali Agha","Yeah. But in general though, is 2016 earned ROE on average similar to 2015, when you put it altogether?","Teresa Madden","And we would expect to see some improvement in it.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then separately just for 2016, as you mentioned the Texas case was disappointing, looks like Colorado guess if they followed the ALJ to the large extent seem to below, what should been asking for. What kind of headwinds does that create for us for 2016? And at this point, is that put us more in the lower half of the range, or how should we be thinking about the implications?","Teresa Madden","I mean, Ali, we were pretty pragmatic when it comes to handicapping, what we put out on the forecast. So, I don't \u2013 it doesn't have much of an impact at all.","Ali Agha","Okay. And last question, when at the earliest should we start to see some of the growth CapEx and rate base implications start to move into your current base case plans?","Teresa Madden","Ali, we filed the energy \u2013 we're going to file a resource plan later in the year in Colorado and that's where you'll start to see the energy future plans, but I mean they will probably be most eminent \u2013 probably be in the backend of our capital forecast. But Ali, let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first three years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first three years and we explained the reasons why for that.","You look at years, four and five, and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the extender's pillars. I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think gives us upside to exceed our GAAP closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more portable customer bills, I think that plays well to our multi-year plan discussions here in Minnesota. But then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of the renewables that are now been made so much more portable by the ITC and PTC extension.","I think, we're being conservative, but I think we can capture with creditability that capital upside. I mean there is a lot of renewables they're going to built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large scale renewables on mine, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable. And we're really \u2013 we're excited about it and I think \u2013 I think it's going to \u2013 it's done a lot for us. And so, I guess you know, we would have first, I think the first utility to talk about the impacts of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us, and I'm really confident in our plans.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Benjamin Fowke","Hey, Julien.","Teresa Madden","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, guys. Well actually let's kick it off just going back to that last question a little bit. Just kind of definitively in terms of timing there for the growth CapEx. Is there kind of a year in which you would frame this, I mean \u2013 perhaps let me frame it this way NOLs obviously in the near-term limit you might be impact the bonus depreciation. Do you need a wait for the cash tax benefit extend hours within in the five-year period or how are you thinking about the timing of that growth CapEx, given the cash tax position?","Benjamin Fowke","I'm Julian, and in terms of \u2013 we don't think that this is dependent on the cash tax position by any means, and we do think the CapEx probably would start in the middle of, I would say, the 2018 timeframe, so -e and we think we'll be well positioned. We have some time to \u2013 because of the NOL situation and the multi-year has been described. So we think that we have a lot of opportunity and that's probably when it would start.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to be clear, if I hear you right, it would also be dependent upon getting approvals in specifically in Colorado?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, yeah, I mean it's...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","The upside CapEx.","Benjamin Fowke","I mean, well, it's not only in Colorado, I mean it's also in Minnesota. And then remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our Analyst Day. And what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado Energy plan have updated that capital forecast, because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that Analyst Day presentation, and we should and I'm confident that you're going to see more renewable, because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. And in fact, if you think about, the PTC is \u2013 it does face down quicker than the ITC. So if you were staging it, you'd probably focus on more wind initially. And you know, you don't \u2013 you've got to look at the NOLs too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level, specifically then it rolls up to the Holdco. I think what you're referring to Julian is maybe some \u2013 you know, if you don't have a tax appetite, some of those things get \u2013 put on the balance sheet for a period of time, and they do. But that's okay. I mean, it turns around and we're very much prepared to wait for that turnaround, because these opportunities I think are extremely compelling, realistic and they're right in front of us, and they are in our backyard and it's organic growth.","Teresa Madden","Maybe just to supplement that in terms of your question about the regulatory process and if you just \u2013 just related to Minnesota. When we went through the last resource planning process of the four wind farms, I mean we're owning three of those for wind farm, so we think they are very supportive. In terms of ownership in Minnesota, and Colorado more to come, but we're very confident.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yeah. Great Teresa.","Teresa Madden","And actually just to get a little clarity on the renewable spend, are you feeling confident about your ability to continue to own solar rate base projects, as you proposed back of the [indiscernible]?","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah. I mean again I think these things are affordable and we always pursue things with the impact on the consumer. And even with low natural gas prices, what we're seeing with wind and now with the extension of PTC says, a) it's a good deal for consumers. Same with solar, I mean, as you know, large scale solar is a better deal for all customers than as rooftop, but \u2013 and I think there is an appetite for that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But even relative to PPA option.","Benjamin Fowke","Well, a PPA in my mind, drilling is kind of like the decision between whether you own a car or lease a car, right. And typically, you can [indiscernible] the PPAs, so it's the cost of ownerships lower in the early years, but as that lease expires and then you got to re-up it and it becomes more expensive. So, when you do a total revenue requirements over the expected life of the asset, it's typically more beneficial to own the asset. And I think our commissions recognize that and I think they incur \u2013 are supportive to Teresa's point of us owning more renewables.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Benjamin Fowke","Hey, Greg.","Teresa Madden","Hey.","Greg Gordon","Hey, good morning. All my questions have been asked. Just getting a little bit more into the [indiscernible] of how bonus impacts you. Can you repeat what your \u2013 what's your authorized return is in your electric deal in Colorado and how much regulatory lag you're currently experiencing there?","Teresa Madden","Our overall authorized return in Colorado is 983 and remember we have the band of about 65 basis points. Up to this point, we have been and through 2015, we have been in a refund position, but we will be entering our second year of the three year and we do think there's some headroom there. So, anyway, that's where we're at.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So, in that \u2013 in Colorado in particular, bonus depreciation would \u2013 wouldn't necessarily \u2013 would only hurt you if it puts you into a refund position vis-\u00e0-vis having a lower rate base number, right?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, it's \u2013 I don't \u2013 I don't think that's really entirely true, Greg, because we've been in a refund position. As Teresa mentioned, we just entered our second three year approach, our plan and that plan required us to do some work to earn that ROE and bonus depreciation on the multi-year will help us earn that authorized ROE more readily. And then of course...","Greg Gordon","No, that's exactly my \u2013 that's exactly my point. That it's not necessarily going to hurt you, if you were...","Benjamin Fowke","Oh, I thought, you said it was [indiscernible] I'm sorry I miss heard you right.","Teresa Madden","I miss heard you too. So yeah, exactly.","Greg Gordon","Okay.","Benjamin Fowke","In that view, it's tougher to get to the \u2013 into a sharing position now, because the plan is a little more difficult, because you've got more spending. So, it only puts you back into a refund position, if you over earn, which is less likely under this plan. And therefore, you might not have as intangible impact in Colorado, as it wouldn't necessarily in Minnesota, where you're \u2013 whatever the new rate plans are going to be, it'll be in there, right.","Teresa Madden","Yeah. So said in another way. We think it makes \u2013 the bonus appreciation in Colorado makes it easier for us to achieve our valve ROEs in Colorado. In Minnesota, you have an \u2013 you're in an NOL position for the next few years. And then years four and five, you start to come out of that, and Grey, what that says to me is, I think it makes the five year multi-plan even more attractive today, than it was prior to that extension. And so, we'll see where that goes. But I mean, it's \u2013 again, that's why we think, this gives us a positive versus a negative.","Greg Gordon","Yeah. All right. Thanks and good luck in the Super Bowl.","Teresa Madden","Thanks Greg.","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, go brought some, where do you brought that up Greg, and I'm sorry about your New York Jeff.","Operator","And the next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah, hi. Good morning.","Benjamin Fowke","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Good morning. So the $900 million for the \u2013 I think, that's for the Colorado that you added. Can you give us maybe a little thought on what you're assuming in there, in terms of 2,000 megawatt, is it mainly for the 1,000 megawatts of wind or you assuming like you win half of it or how are you getting to that?","Benjamin Fowke","Yes. You got it and you take...","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Benjamin Fowke","...entire spend of the 1,000 megawatts, which I think is 600 wind, 400 solar. And we assume we get a half of it.","Teresa Madden","That's exactly right. Yep.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. That's easy enough. Second question is just and an apologize to beat this that horse to Paul, but I know you're talk about the benefits after 18 of the kind of the bonus and rate headroom and all those things, but just to make sure understand, if the NOL benefit is gone then the bonus impact is actually bigger out test 2018? So obviously, you have more rate headroom, but it also impacts rate base more. Or if I'm not right.","Teresa Madden","Yes.","Benjamin Fowke","Well. I mean, I think that's \u2013 go ahead, Teresa.","Teresa Madden","No. I mean I think you're right. I mean in terms of as we tailor down, I mean in the latter part, but that I mean two things and I think Ben described it, since we're in the NOL and we're going to be in the NOL and Minnesota for the first couple of years, we have time to work through some of these things and we have opportunity potentially for investments, upside investments which we've talked about in terms of our resources.","Steve Fleishman","Right.","Teresa Madden","With modernization you talked about that at the Analyst Day. So yeah, we think...","Steve Fleishman","Then you have the \u2013 so you're right. Obviously you're point is that you've got line of site on project opportunities and then it fits well within your rate headroom kind of limitations and all that stuff to fill that in do things that you want to do, so okay.","Teresa Madden","Yeah. I think that's exactly right. And it goes beyond 2018, frankly beyond 2020 you just look at what we're doing here in Minnesota. There's a tremendous amount of renewables, grid modernization, there's a lot of work that to be done and Steve I think the limiter has always been what are -- what is the pace of rate increases. And so, we have always had more capital opportunities than we've executed on, because we're mindful of what happens when you \u2013 you are in front of the regulator asking for more than a modest rate increase. So I think this actually is very, very much facilitates our strategic plans and keeps that affordability equation where it needs to be. So, that's why we think it's positive.","Benjamin Fowke","Exactly.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then on the Minnesota rate case, could you maybe just give a little more color on how likely you see chances for settling that, given I know there are lot of involvement in getting the legislation done to begin with it.","Benjamin Fowke","What's the begin \u2013 it always takes two to settle, right. I mean so and we do had time scheduled over the summer for that. I think that's a good sign. I think that if you look at the case, it's about a straight forward issue you can get. So, you know I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get something done. It would make sense to get something done, and got Marvin McDaniel, Chris Clark if you want to add anything to that, you're on the front lines.","Teresa Madden","That is to [indiscernible] I think you're right. I think we have a great opportunity and we look forward to working with parties to see what we can accomplish.","Benjamin Fowke","Yeah, you said you agree with it.","Teresa Madden","I agree with you [Inaudible].","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Last question just on I know you talked about the investment opportunities potentially in gas reserves. We're seeing more and more comp \u2013 electric utilities also invested in gas, midstream assets. I'm wondering if you're seeing anything in there as well that might fit?","Benjamin Fowke","Well, Steven, I think for us \u2013 when I think of midstream, I think of pipeline type assets, ideally PERC regulated and not so much gathering and processing and only that fits in our risk profile. So, I think for us the thing to do is twofold, one, there is anticipated to be a lot of shake out the current oil and gas prices remain and maybe that will create some opportunities for us at reasonable cost, reasonable cost being underscored out there. And we'll also continuing to look for organic type \u2013 pipeline type growth opportunities in our own regions in part due to the clean power plant and the need for more gas redundancy. But don't look for us to jump into what I would \u2013 I think you would consider classic midstream assets.","I'd also tell you, as when I mentioned on the call that while we're interested in get rate base in gas reserves, in today's very low natural gas environment, it's difficult to find those opportunities that makes sense from a consumer standpoint. But our thought is, as you know, things cycle, commodity prices change and you got to have a framework in place, so you can execute on it quickly opportunistically, and that's what we're seeking to accomplish initially in Colorado.","Steve Fleishman","Great. Thank you.","Benjamin Fowke","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Freeman with Nexus.","Benjamin Fowke","Hi, Paul.","Paul Freeman","Thanks. How are you? And I guess I'm a little \u2013 still a little confused sort of on the first three years, because you're showing about $600 million of less rate base in your base case, and the tax position, would have been the same either way, in terms of whether you're not paying taxes, because of bonus or not paying taxes, because of the NOL. You're essentially in the same position of not paying tax. So, is \u2013 if you could just help explain the offset to the lower rate base, and the tax position sort of being the same. Is it because, you're taking stretch spending and moving it forward. And that's what's offsetting the lower rate base or is there something I'm missing?","Teresa Madden","No, it's \u2013 Teresa, you correct me, if I'm wrong.","Paul Freeman","Sure.","Teresa Madden","In public service Colorado, we're in a three year plan. So to the extent, you see rate base reductions, which we do, you've got a fixed revenue stream, and you're earning on a lower rate base. So, your earnings doesn't change, but the base that you're earning on it does. In Minnesota, and again, you have to look at where, you have to look at each operating utility in addition to where we are on a consolidated basis. And in Minnesota at NSP, you've got, they have an NOL position, that is for the next few years is parked on the balance sheet. So we are earning on that. And then, when it starts to roll off, it reduces your \u2013 the amount of revenue requirements you need. So that's basically, why it doesn't have an impact on us in the first three years. Does that make sense?","Paul Freeman","Thanks, sir. Yes.","Teresa Madden","Yeah, I think you answered it fine.","Operator","And the next question will come from Gale Muse [ph] with Aviva Investors.","Benjamin Fowke","Thank you.","Teresa Madden","Hi, Gale.","Unidentified Analyst","Hello. Good afternoon. I'm calling from the [indiscernible] Investors, the asset management at the UK insurance company We focus on materially short and long-term risks, facing investee companies. And you know policy at action associated to controlling climate change is already underway such as the Clean Air Act. And if you, and following the global agreement in Paris, the climate change, we were wondering what additional step, Xcel Energy was taking to ensure the business is resilient to this cause and constrain global outlook.","Teresa Madden","Well, that's a great question Gale, and I appreciate that, and I think if you \u2013 when you get more familiar with Xcel Energy, you seem not only have we been an environmental leader for more than a decade and have reduced our carbon emissions in addition to many other emissions, but our carbon emissions specifically by more than 20% of our 2005 baseline we'll reduce them by 30% by 2030, but we're going to be on that. As a leader on renewables, leader in converting aging coal plants and natural gas. If you take a look at what we're doing right here in the upper mid west with our plan, we'll have reduced carbon emissions by 2030 by 60%. That will exceed the Clean Power Plan targets. So, we recognized what you're talking about and what we believe, as it can be done, but you need to do it pragmatically and with affordability and reliability in line and when you have a long-term plan under a good policy framework, you can accomplish that. So, thank you for your question, and look forward some good things from Xcel Energy.","Operator","And the final question will come from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. How are you?","Benjamin Fowke","Hey Paul.","Teresa Madden","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just you've been over it, and I apologize I wasn't quick enough. You went over the sales growth forecast, I think with 50 basis points and was that right that included leap year...","Teresa Madden","Yes.","Paul Patterson","...or exclude? It did include leap year. And what were the other things that we're driving it as well?","Teresa Madden","Well, let me start with, yeah, our guidance is 0.5% of 1%. The leap year is 0.3% and we are seeing customer growth of about 1% across our system. And we are seeing \u2013 if we look at the last two quarters, well, on the annual basis in terms of use per customers particularly in our residential class, we are showing a decline in our larger jurisdictions. The last two quarters, we have actually seen that plateau. And so, we don't expect to see this continue. I mean two quarters is not necessarily a trend, but we do expect that to levelize. So, we are expecting to see some improvement. And then, specifically to some of our large C&Is where we do see some decline, we see that's going forward that we don't expect that to continue. We see some stabilization with where they will be at in 2016 as well.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Most of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much.","Teresa Madden","All right. Thank you.","Benjamin Fowke","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Teresa Madden for any additional or closing remarks.","Teresa Madden","Well, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions, and thanks very much.","Benjamin Fowke","And go Bronco.","Teresa Madden","Go Bronco. Yeah.","Benjamin Fowke","Thanks everyone. Bye-bye.","Teresa Madden","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","Teresa Madden","Thanks.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"22744":["Xcel Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) Q4 2017 Earnings Call February  7, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul A.

Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Analysts","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy 2017 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And now, your host for today's conference, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Johnson, please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 year-end earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions.","This morning, we will review our 2017 results, discuss tax reform, and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filing with the SEC.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain ongoing earnings metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Our ongoing earnings and EPS exclude a $23 million or $0.05 earnings per share one-time charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The comparable GAAP measures, a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of these charges are included in our earnings release, which is available on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning to everyone. I hope everybody enjoyed the Super Bowl. We certainly enjoyed hosting it in Minneapolis. Glad the lights stayed on. And while our Vikings weren't in the Super Bowl, it was a fun event. And I think at Xcel Energy, we had a Super Bowl year in 2017, performing fantastically financially, strategically, and operationally. I wanted to start with some of the key accomplishments and recognize the outstanding efforts of our employees in 2017.","We successfully completed CapEx 2020, a 13-year project entailing over 800 miles of transmission lines, $2 billion of investment and working with 11 different utilities. Our nuclear operations have one of its best performance years, achieving a capacity factor of 91% while reducing refuel outage times and lowering cost.","Xcel Energy was named the number one utility wind energy provider in the United States by AWEA for the 12th consecutive year. We were named a Military Times Best for Vets Employer for the fourth consecutive year, ranking 19th on a list of 82 companies that received that honor.","We successfully completed our multi-year SAP implementation, which included a new general ledger and work asset management system. This is part of our productivity through technology initiative, which will drive efficiency and lower our cost structure. And not to diminish our financial results, we had another strong year with ongoing EPS of $2.30 in 2017, which is the midpoint of our guidance. This was our 13th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance.","Finally, we also raised our dividend by 5.9%, which represents the 14th straight year we increased our dividend.","Tax reform is all over the news, and I wanted to give you our high-level overview of the key points; and Bob will provide more details later. We believe that tax reform is beneficial to our customers and will result in lower revenue requirements, which provides the opportunity to reduce customer bills, make additional investments in areas that are important for our customers, and take actions to preserve our credit ratings. We expect tax reform will be mildly accretive to our earnings over the next five years, as it essentially adds approximately $1.3 billion to our rate base.","We are reaffirming our 2018 EPS guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47; and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 6%; and dividend growth of 5% to 7%. Finally, we do not anticipate any changes in our strategy to lead the clean energy transition while keeping customer bills low.","We introduced our Steel-for-Fuel strategy back in 2016, and it's been a great success; and let me provide you with some recent updates. Last year, we introduced our Colorado Energy Plan. The plan which is supported by a wide range of stakeholders calls for the addition of up to 1,000 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of solar, and 700 megawatts of natural gas or storage, as well as the early retirement of two of the coal units at our Comanche plant.","This is an opportunity for Xcel Energy to continue to transition its energy supply portfolio in Colorado with no increase in customer bills. Implementation of the Colorado Energy Plan will allow us to achieve by 2027 an energy mix of 55% renewables and a 60% carbon reduction.","In November, we received bids from our RFP. While we're still in the process of evaluating the bids, we were pleased with the robust number of bids and the attractive pricing. We were pleased to see the levelized median bids from wind coming in at approximately $18 per megawatt hour, while solar proposals were just under $30 per megawatt hour. Bidders have just responded to the option to refresh their pricing for tax reform and solar tariff considerations.","Hearings are scheduled for this week, and we expect a commission decision on a settlement in March. Assuming the commission approves the settlement, we will file a recommended portfolio in April with a final commission decision expected this summer.","Next, I'll provide a quick update on our SPS wind proposal, which includes 1,000 megawatts of our self-build wind in Texas and New Mexico, and a 230-megawatt wind PPA. In New Mexico, we reached a settlement with various parties, which has been filed with the commission. Hearings on the settlement were held in December. At the request of the hearing examiner, we provided analysis of the effective tax reform, which clearly shows the project still result in meaningful customer savings.","We've also reached a settlement in principle with parties in Texas and are working on finalizing the documents. There are no significant issues outstanding, and we plan to file the settlement with the Texas Commission shortly. We expect final decisions from both commissions by the end of the first quarter of this year.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on full-year 2017 results and for details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. As Ben indicated, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance and deliver 2017 ongoing earnings of $2.30 per share compared with $2.21 per share of ongoing earnings in 2016.","The most significant earnings driver for the year include a higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.19 per share largely due to rate increases and non-fuel riders to recover our capital investments, lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.12 per share. Please note the lower effective tax rate is partly due to an increase in wind production tax credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin.","Lower O&M expenses and a higher AFDC equity combined to increase earnings by $0.06 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings by $0.21 per share, and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items netted to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share.","Turning to sales, our weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 0.1% for 2017. Natural gas sales increase 2.7% in 2017 on a weather and leap year-adjusted basis. Our 2017 gains in electric and natural gas sales are largely driven by the large C&I segments across our operating companies.","We continue to see positive customer growth in our service territories for both the electric and the natural gas businesses, but that growth has generally been offset by lower use per customer, primarily in the residential sector, largely attributable to improvements in energy efficiency. We realized another strong year of cost management as we continue to improve efficiency across our businesses. We improved operations and lower costs, predominantly in our nuclear and fossil generation fleets and we're able to offset the $0.04 adverse impact of weather in 2017, as compared to normal. Our commitment to continuous improvement in productivity through technology has resulted in our 2017 O&M expenses being slightly below 2014 levels. This is consistent with our longer term objective of keeping O&M flat across all of Xcel Energy.","Now, let me provide a quick update on our pending rate cases. In Colorado, we have an electric case seeking $245 million rate increase over a four-year period. Interim rates are expected to be effective in June of 2018.","We also have a multi-year natural gas case in Colorado, seeking $139 million increase over a three-year period. Interim rates were implemented in January. We have a pending electric case in Texas seeking a net rate increase of $55 million. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of 2018 with final rates to be implemented retroactively to January of 2018.","And finally, we have a pending electric case in New Mexico seeking a $43 million rate increase. We anticipate a decision and implementation of final rates in the second half of 2018. All of these rate proceedings were filed before the new tax legislation was proposed. In these cases, and in other jurisdictions, we're having active discussions and formal proceedings with our regulators regarding the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and how we will provide the expected benefits to our customers.","As we progress through these conversations, we'll keep our stakeholders apprised of the outcomes, which we expect to be constructive.","With that, let me spend just a few minutes on the potential impacts of the new law. For more information, please see our earnings release, which has an extensive disclosure. However, let me start with a few key takeaways. As Ben said earlier, we believe tax reform is beneficial to our customers due to lower revenue requirements. We also expect to be able to offset the lower tax yield on holding company debt and deliver on our earnings guidance this year. The lower corporate tax rate reduces the value of the wind production tax credit to our customers. However, we have identified offsets in our projects and they continue to remain very beneficial to our customers.","Finally, in a static analysis, the tax law changes will reduce cash from operations and adversely impact our credit metrics. However, any near-term impacts will be largely dependent on regulatory actions taken as a result of the new tax law. We're very focused on credit quality and maintaining a strong balance sheet, which provides our company's access to capital at reasonable terms and reduces the cost of capital for our customers.","We're actively working with our regulators to develop plans and alternatives, which would provide our customers with the benefits of tax reform while maintaining strong credit metrics. Some of the potential actions include: accelerated asset depreciation or amortization; higher authorized equity ratios, or ROEs, at our regulated utilities; deferral or avoidance of future rate cases; and potential additional investment in areas of focus for our regulators.","Ultimately, tax reform results in lower taxes, lower deferred taxes and, correspondingly, lower cash flow metrics. And in response, we expect to moderate our five-year capital expenditure plan by $500 million and issue up to $300 million of additional equity. Even with the reduction in capital expenditures and the modest equity issuance, we project rate base growth of 6.5% and our earnings growth will be at the upper end of our 5% to 6% target.","The ultimate amount of any equity issuance and changes in capital expenditures will depend on regulatory actions of our various state commissions. We anticipate that these revisions to our plan and implementation of some of the proposed regulatory actions will result in a consolidated FFO to debt of 17% to 18% over the five-year time period prior to any rating agency adjustments, and should be sufficient to maintain strong credit ratings.","With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2017 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 13th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 14th straight year. We realized a 1% decrease in O&M expenses. We resolved several regulatory proceedings, including: a multi-year electric case in Minnesota; decoupling an advanced grid proposals in Colorado; and an electric and natural gas case in Wisconsin.","We continued to execute on our Steel-for-Fuel strategy. We received regulatory approval for 1,550 megawatts of new wind in the Upper Midwest, proposed to build a 300-megawatt wind farm in South Dakota, and reached settlements in principle for the 1,230 megawatts of wind in Texas and New Mexico.","We reached a settlement with a diverse group of stakeholders on the Colorado Energy Plan, which proposes the addition of renewable projects and the retirement of two coal facilities. We are well-positioned to deliver on our 2018 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share, our 5% to 6% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll take any questions.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Operator, you there?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And for our first question, we go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Julien.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is Josephine actually hopping in here for Julien. Congrats on the results.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. Good morning.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I just have a quick question. I think you said that with tax reform your new rate base growth that you're looking at is 6.5%, hitting the upper end of the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate. I was wondering, with the Colorado Clean Energy Plan, what is then the further CapEx upside from that translate into your new rate base growth?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","So the question is if CEP, which is not in our base CapEx...","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Exactly.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","...if that's included, what will that do to rate base grow growth?","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Exactly. Like how much further up can it go?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think that really depends on what we see in ultimate and final bids from the process, which are still pending. I think a good estimate is probably 50 basis points higher in rate base CAGR.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Great. And then, just on the equity issuance. You just said $300 million in additional to the $385 million that you had announced, I think, on the third quarter. Would that then still be as part of the DRIP? Are you just expanding the DRIP?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No. I don't think the DRIP at $385 million, as we indicated in our third quarter call, was likely sort of the large size of the dividend reinvestment program. I think the $300 million we'd contemplate in a market issuance.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, great. And then, one last question. Just \u2013 I think you had mentioned earlier in 8-K that you were thinking of trying to increase the equity ratio as part of the tax reform mitigation strategy. Have you had any conversations with the commissions on that subject and do you think that's a possibility?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, this is Ben. I think we've had obviously preliminary, but constructive dialogues with all of our regulators. And I think the importance of strong credit ratings is not lost on them, so higher equity ratio is a dialogue we're having at SPS. And I think there'll be other dialogues around higher equity ratios potentially, maybe increased amortization which also contributes to cash flow. And I think our regulators are going to look at tax reform. Everybody recognized the benefits to the consumer, but I think they're going to also make sure that balance sheet stay strong. So, we're encouraged by what we've heard so far.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And that's not yet like the assumptions of a higher equity ratio are not yet reflected in that 5% to 6% EPS growth rate, right?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean that's \u2013 I think one of the things that we would hope for is that if the $400 million of revenues that we're going to stream ultimately back to the consumers if we get higher equity ratios, et cetera, that could help offset the tax yield difference that we have at the holdco.","Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hi, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I was wondering on the tax reform stuff again, what's the chance that incorporating those in rate and getting into the regulatory process might delay some of the decisions and some of the rate increase that you're expecting in 2018 and even maybe early 2019. Give me a sense of timing there and how regulators are approaching that?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Travis, it's Bob. We've had a lot of constructive dialogues across almost all of our jurisdictions at this point, particularly the ones where we've got pending rate cases with Texas, New Mexico and the two cases in Colorado. I think the regulators and the stakeholders in all those cases are contemplating the impacts of tax reform either as parts of those cases or as adjuncts to those cases.","So, I don't think it impacts the timing or the estimate of our rate case revenues that we're expecting in either 2018 or 2019. I guess the one consideration I'd say there is our filed case or our filed testimony in South Dakota contemplates potentially we're under-earning in South Dakota and it contemplates potentially not filing a rate case as part of tax reform.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Okay. And what about Minnesota, how would you go about the regulatory process there given the...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, there'll be a docket in Minnesota, Travis, to discuss the effects of tax reform. We're still in the multi-year plan, but we'll figure out a way to account for that either through an accounting deferral or some actual actions. In Colorado, that's your next question, we're having dialogues right now as we're in an active rate case and we have settlements, not unanimous settlements, that we'll be presenting to the commission. And back to my earlier comment about constructive dialogue, I think our commissions appreciate that we're bringing them options. And, essentially, this is complicated, educating them on the full holistic implications of tax reform.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay, great. That's all I had.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Travis, one other thing I'd just say is I'd point you to the earnings release. We put an entire page of where we are in dialogue with each of our regulatory jurisdictions. That should give you a pretty good guide as to the conversations we've had to-date and where we expect those to go over the next sort of three to six months.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay, great. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Travis.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Jonathan.","Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Constantine Lednev on Jonathan's behalf.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Everybody's got their proxies on the call today. I guess we're the second priority.","Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","(21:44). Actually, just a quick question on the equity issuance. The 2018 guidance doesn't assume a share count and you mentioned the $300 million of incremental issuance. Is that going to be spread over the five years or is it kind of more lumped together to the front or the back end somewhere?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","We haven't actually spent a lot of time on pinpointing exact dates. It's probably more front-loaded than back-loaded, but it really will depend on the conversations with both the regulatory agencies and how we approach tax reform and credit in our operating companies, as well as the conversations we have with the rating agencies following those conversations. So I wouldn't expect it to be backdated, but we do affirm that the $2.37 to $2.47 is good for this year.","Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I guess the same comment goes for the $500 million of CapEx, right?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, similar comments. Again, I'd say the capital is probably a 2019, 2020, 2021 issue. Most of the stuff in 2018 is underway and in progress, but I think that any trimming of capital is probably a little bit more backdated in the plan.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think too, just to add to that $500 million, it's really maybe a quiet story at Xcel, but we are really improving our supply chain efficiency. You're seeing that in our results with O&M, but you're also going to see that in our ability I think to, on a per unit basis, get things done more efficiently. I can't be more pleased with how well our nuclear operations are performing both operationally and financially. And when you become more efficient, you can get more done with less capital. So we don't have any specific projects targeted to take out now. We just know there are opportunities to do that.","Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Yeah. I think the other questions are already answered both in the remarks and in Q&A, so thanks.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Joe Zhou with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Hi, it's Andy Levi, guys. How are you doing?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Andy, hey. So you are the real deal now.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","All real. Everyone is a real deal. It's just next time you schedule your call, maybe you don't want to do it when there's another company doing a call. That may be...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Maybe they don't want to schedule it when we're doing our call.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Vice versa. Yes, it goes both ways. Anyway, just two clarification questions because I've kind of been popping on and off. So just on the $300 million of incremental equity, I heard the initial comments just a moment ago. So what you're saying is \u2013 because I'm just trying to get a sense of timing \u2013 that first you kind of want to go through the regulatory process the next couple months, see where that kind of falls out and then decide the timing on \u2013 and, well, we know the amount \u2013 but the timing of the equity, is that what you are saying?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think that's right. I mean, I'll let Bob add. But the point is, and I think you picked up on Andy. So this is a iterate process. We need to have the conversations with our regulators. They need to give us the signals on what's important to them, and I do think credit quality will be important to them. So, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're having I think good preliminary dialogues across the board in all of our eight states.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Bob, do you have any additional comment?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No, I think Ben got it all.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. And then just kind of sticking with that, so you get through your discussions and you figure things out, and then Bob mentioned it will be front-end loaded. The last time you did block equity or you did a larger chunk of equity that was not ESOP or DRIP, did you do an at-the-money or did you kind of just do a block or I don't remember?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think the last equity issuance, and I'm looking around the room, the last equity issuance predated me, but I believe it was at-the-money issuance.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, it was.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","At-the-market issuance.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","And again, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth and I don't know what you're comfortable saying, but would that be a similar conduit that you would issue equity or could we possibly see a block at some point just to get it done?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think, Andy, I'll consider all opportunities to get it done effectively. But an at-the-market is probably the base case and we see what the alternatives look like.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. You think about it Andy, I mentioned that essentially tax reform adds $1.3 billion to our rate base, but that's even after \u2013 that's net of the reducing CapEx by $500 million. So it's not a lot of equity to support credit ratings and we are committed to credit ratings. But that's why at the end of the day even with modest amounts of equity, assuming we have constructive dialogues with the regulators, which I think we are having, this will be accretive to our earnings growth.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","No. I guess you're missing what I'm trying to get at. I mean, I think $300 million is not a relevant amount and obviously the story is more than intact if not getting better, which lead to my next question. But I'm just trying to get a sense of timing because that's kind of important too, whether it's just a block or at-the-money. Makes it just a little bit of difference as far as trading dynamics when we get to that point. So, that was what I was getting at. And then my other question, and I think it was asked earlier, but I wasn't clear on what I heard, that's my fault. So whether it's Colorado or some of the other initiatives you have out there that are pending on the regulatory side that we have not got final approval, you may have settlements in whatever it may be, but those would be incremental to the 5% to 6% growth rate? I'm not saying you'll grow more than 5% to 6%, but that those projects are not contemplated currently in that 5% to 6%. Is that correct or not?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Andy, the only thing that's outside of our capital forecast is the Colorado Energy Plan.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Okay.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","So, that's the only capital that's outside of our \u2013 or things that are outside of our...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","That's still pending regulatory wise?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That is correct.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. Thank you. That's clear. Thanks a lot. Thank you.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You bet.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","And with that ladies and gentleman, we have no further questions on our roster.

Please go ahead.","Paul Johnson","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy\u2019s 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller.","This morning we will review our 2014 second quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2014 guidance. Slides that accompany today\u2019s call are available on our web page. In addition we will post a video on our website of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results.","As a reminder some of the comments during today\u2019s conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release in our filings with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin Fowke","Thank you, Paul and good morning. Let me start by highlighting some of the key takeaways from the quarter and Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. Overall we had another solid quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share compared with $0.40 per share last year. It\u2019s important to recognize that last year\u2019s results included a positive weather benefit of $0.03 per share while this year\u2019s weather was relatively normal for the quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, we are $0.03 per share ahead of last year and expect to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings.","Our quarterly results benefited from better than expected sales growth for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.7% and weather adjusted for natural gas sales increased 5%. While we are hesitant to call this trend it is certainly very positive as it is the third quarter in a row in which weather adjusted sales have exceeded expectations.","In the second quarter we completed our aftermarket equity program and we have now issued about $175 million of equity in 2014. I\u2019m very pleased to report that we no longer anticipate issuing any additional equity over the next five years beyond the normal issuances associated with our dividend reinvestment programs and benefit plans.","This change in assumption is driven by our strong balance sheet and better than projected cash flows. There are no material changes to our capital expenditure assumption over the five year period. As you know in December we announced our plans to form a Transco. Our objective is to optimize our transmission investment as the FERC rules and market opportunities continue to involve. So this brings in preparation to participate in the MISO and SPP transmission competitive bidding processes we created two transmission subsidiaries. We formed the Xcel Energy Transmission Development Company which will compete for the first set of transmission projects expected to be proposed in MISO South.","We also created the Xcel Energy Southwest transmission company which will compete for transmission projects in SPP. We expect SPP to release the first set of competitive transmission projects for bid in 2015. We are planning to make Federal and State Regulatory filings related to the Transcos in the third quarter of 2014 and we hope to have these regulatory proceedings resolved in 2015.","Strategically the formation of Transcos will complement our existing transmission business which is expected to spend $4.5 billion over the next five years. While there may be some opportunities to transfer existing assets into our Transcos, you should expect that the most of the plan in transmission spend over the next five years will be made at the operating company level.","We will continue to take advantage of the right of first refusal and incumbency status we have in many of our states while at the same time, expanding our incremental transmission investment opportunities through our Transco operations. Bottom-line we have a great track record as a proven industry leader in transmission in terms of operation, development and construction and we are positioned to continue to have success as the market evolves.","Finally I would like to wrap up my comments by discussing environmental policy. The EPA recently issued its proposed Greenhouse Gas Rule which regulates -- which rather require states to develop plants to reduce Greenhouse emission from existing power plants by 30% by 2030. ","However the EPA has specific state reduction targets very significantly with certain state targets being very aggressive. For example, some of our states would be required to make reductions much greater than 30%. While incremental investment opportunities could arise from the more stringent EPA regulations we are concerned that the rule does not give sufficient credit to actions taken prior to 2012.","Over the last decade we have implemented significant clean energy programs that have reduced our emissions. Our proactive actions to add renewables, retiring inefficient coal plants add new natural gas generation and add DFM have allowed us to successfully reduce our carbon emissions nearly 20% since 2015.","Further we\u2019re on track to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2020. So what we need to do is make sure our customers receive full value for these initiatives and investments. The EPA will take public comment on the proposed rule and final rule is expected to be issued in 2015. We plan to continue to work constructively with the EPA and state policy makers to shape and implement the best final rule and state plans for our customer and the company.","With that I will turn it over to Teresa.","Teresa Madden","Thanks Ben and good morning. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share compared with 2013 second quarter earnings of $0.40 per share. The biggest driver of the difference was weather. 2013 second quarter results included a positive weather impact of just over $0.03 per share compared with relatively normal weather in 2014.","Other drivers included improved electric and gas margins resulting from rate filing in several jurisdictions and better than expected weather adjusted sales. We also experienced higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expenses. These cost increases were expected and are consistent with our financial plan.","Let me start by providing an update on sales in the economies in our local service territories. Once again sales growth was stronger than expected for the quarter. Normally, we discuss quarterly results. However I\u2019m going to focus on year-to-date sales as the longer time frame is more indicative of a potential trend. Our year-to-date weather adjusted retail electric sales increased 1.7% and firm natural gas sales increased 5%. While growth was favorable across the board it varied by operating company.","Beginning with SPS, year-to-date weather adjusted retail electric sales increased 3.6% largely driven by growth in the C&I class although we also saw strong residential growth. We continue to experience the positive impact from oil and gas exploration and production expansion in the Southeastern New Mexico Permian Basin area. Additional low growth in ethanol production and uranium enrichment also contributed to the higher sale.","Year-to-date weather adjusted retail sales at NSC Wisconsin increased 3.2%. Largely C&I sales were strong primarily due to increased load from one of our larger customers who was operating their pipeline at reduced capacity in the first two quarters of 2013 but returned to full capacity in 2014. Customer growth combined with slightly increasing use per customer drove residential sales. Year-to-date weather adjusted retail sales at PSCo increased 1.2% and were primarily attributable to customer growth in the residential sector and higher average use in the small C&I class.","In addition, two new food manufacturing companies and improvement in the energy sector have fueled gains in the large C&I class.","Finally year-to-date weather adjusted retail sales at NSP-Minnesota increased 8\/10ths of a percent. The higher sales were driven by growth in number of customers increased use for customer in both the residential and the small C&I classes and the absence of storms that cause customer outages in 2013.","Economic conditions are generally stronger across the Xcel Energy region compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our service territory of 4.8% remains well below the national average of 6.3%. In addition, the number of the jobs in the Xcel Energy region grew 2.3% for the quarter, compared with 1.8% for the nation. While we are encouraged by the better than expected sales it is still too early to declare this a trend. We continue to project weather adjusted sales growth of about 1% for 2014 which is below the 1.7% growth we have experienced year-to-date.","Turning more specifically to the second quarter earnings electric margin increased $48 million for the quarter. Key drivers included implementation of final and interim rate which increased margin by $38 million, non-fuel riders increased margin by $17 million and stronger than anticipated weather adjusted sales increased margin by $7 million. These positive factors were partially offset by an unfavorable quarterly weather comparison, the recognition of the reserve for a potential customer refunded PSCo as well as other items.","The reserve for a customer refund highlights the success of the 2012 three year rate plan we implemented in Colorado. Over the last three years we have earned or are projected to earn above our authorized return in our PSCo electric business. Clearly this demonstrates the advantages of a multi-year plan and supports our strategy of implementing multi-year rate plan in other jurisdictions.","Turning to the natural gas side of the business, margin increased by $6 million. This was largely due to rate increases and weather adjusted sales growth partially offset by unfavorable weather impacts. O&M expenses increased $23 million or 4.1% primarily driven by higher nuclear cost. As we discussed last quarter this deviation does not represent our planned run-rate for the year.","The year-to-date deviation is fueled due to the timing of O&M expenses in 2013. This was primarily due to the extended outage at our Monticello nuclear plant as part of the light extension and power upgrade project which was completed with the plant coming back online in the summer of 2013. As a reminder nuclear added cost are deferred during the outage and then amortized over the following 18 to 24 months. In addition, our O&M costs were at their highest level in the third and fourth quarters of 2013.","Following the positive 2013 summer weather earnings impact we decided to increase our investment in the system in the later part of the year which serves to increase O&M in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. As a result, we continue to expect our 2014 O&M expenses will increase 2% to 3% consistent with our original guidance assumption. Finally, other taxes increased about $14 million or almost 14% largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado.","Next, I\u2019ll comment on several regulatory proceedings, additional details are included in our earnings release. We recently filed rebuttal testimony in our Minnesota electric case and lowered our request by approximately $23 million in 2014 and $3.5 million in 2015. The revise request includes our updated sales forecast which reflects the better than expected sales we have experienced in Minnesota. We also included a proposal to thru up sales based on weather adjusted results at the end of the year.","In addition, we also updated our property tax forecast and included a proposal to thru up to actual results at year-end. We think these proposals address two of the more significant adjustments recommend by the Department of Commerce. Key dates include, their rebuttal testimony is due August 4th, the ALJ report is scheduled for December and a final decision in this case is expected in March of 2015.","In early July, the Department of Commerce filed their testimony in the Monticello prudence review and recommended disallowance of approximately 72 million on a Minnesota jurisdictional basis. This equates to a total amount of 94 million for NSP Minnesota. We disagree with the Department\u2019s assessment and continue to believe our investment was prudent. While completing the projects took longer and cost more than we initially projected similar projects at other new nuclear plants across the country demonstrate that our experience was not unique. The project was in many ways more complicated and difficult than new construction.","Regardless it was essential that this work be done right and we believe we made reasonable and prudent decisions over the five year span of the project. We had largely rebuild nuclear power plant that will provide our customers with carbon free, low cost power for the next 20 year. We look forward to the opportunity to provide additional support for the project and to address issues raised by the Department of Commerce and any other interveners in our rebuttal testimony on August 26.","Other key dates in the schedule include the thorough Rebuttal testimony is due September 19th, the ALJ report is scheduled for December and a final decision on the Monticello prudence review is expected in March of 2015. The results from the final decision will be implemented in the Minnesota rate case decision. We remain confident that we will reach a constructive outcome in both the Minnesota rate case and the Monticello prudence review.","In June, we filled a Colorado electric rate case seeking an increase in annual revenue of approximately $138 million or 4.9% and the initiation of a clean air, clean job investment rider that would cover 2016 and 2017. Our objective is to establish on multi-year regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. We believe this plan would accomplish that goal. It is early in the process so a procedure schedule hasn\u2019t been established. However, we anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2015.","In Texas, we requested a net increase in electric rates of $48.1 million or 5.3%. We\u2019re in settlement discussion with various parties and hope to reach an agreement soon. During the quarter, we also filed rate cases in Wisconsin and South Dakota. Similar to Colorado it is still fairly early in the processes so, there isn\u2019t much to report. Details on both these cases are included in the earnings release. It has been a busy regulatory schedule for us but these rate cases should be resolved by year-end or in the first quarter of next year and will provide us with regulatory certainty in 2015 and beyond.","This morning, we are reaffirming our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. The guidance range based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceeding.","With that I will wrap up my comments, with six months completed we\u2019re $0.03 per share ahead of last year and on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We continue to experience better than expected sales growth with year-to-date weather adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.7% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 5%. We have completed our aftermarket equity program and we don\u2019t anticipate issuing any incremental equity beyond our dividend reinvestment program and to fund benefit program over the next five years. This is based on our current capital expenditure plan.","We continue to make program on the regulatory front and expect to reach constructive outcomes in our major jurisdictions. We continue to expect 2014 O&M expense to grow 2% to 3% from last year consistent with our original guidance assumption. And finally, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2014 earnings guidance and long term financial objective of growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually.","Operator we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). And our first question does come from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS","I was wondering if you could expand more on the independent Transco plant. Which regions do you think you have the most opportunities and also like what kind of competitive advantage you might have outside of your own footprint?","Benjamin Fowke","The regions we would compete in, it would be MISO and SPP. I think both regions offer great opportunities for us. We have got a history of delivering large projects and what comes to my mind when I say that is CapEx 2020, when you think about that, that\u2019s a project where we have multiple partners. We collaborated with those partners and put together what\u2019s turned out be an extremely successful transmission build in the upper Midwest.","So we have got that advantage I think of being able to collaborate, we have got a track record of delivering transmission projects at a price point that I haven\u2019t seen anybody else match. And we are executing on time. So we\u2019ve have got a lot of experience. In fact I believe we\u2019re the largest builder of 345 lines in the nation. So I think you put all that together and we are positioned well to win in a competitive environment. Did I get your question answered right?","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Yes, yes, thanks. And one other question to and this is more related to the Colorado rate case. Just curious about given economic conditions and your view of the future, I realize that you\u2019re in discussions right now \u2013 I don\u2019t know what you can say, what what\u2019s more important? A multi-year settlement that keeps things steady for many years or trackers?","Benjamin Fowke","There is amount -- different spokes all go to the center of the wheel, the important thing is the result. You probably could do it with either, to be quite honest with you.","Operator","And our next question does from line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","I am going to stay on the Transco subject here, I was wondering what your thoughts are in terms of long term investment projects and potential growth, even the viability of a Transco if FERC comes back with the rate cuts that perhaps they have targeted or suggest in the Northeast and then obviously the complaints in MISO. What are your thoughts on if we get a 100 - 150 basis points cuts in FERC ROEs in terms of the viability and growth opportunities in Transco?","Benjamin Fowke","Well I think Travis clearly the lower the allowed ROE is the more of a damper it puts on the enthusiasm to build transmission. That said it doesn\u2019t surprise us that we\u2019re starting to see those ROEs do down and I think in a competitive environment they might go down for other reasons. But the advantage I think of having a Transco is it allows you to look at a larger footprint that allows you to more efficiently collaborate with other partners and it gives you much more financial flexibility. So I think you\u2019re going to see that trend perhaps continue hopefully not as severe as you mentioned but I don\u2019t think that dampens our desire to want to have a Transco.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","And then on that competition side that you mentioned, how much competition do you expect here? We\u2019ve heard a couple of companies mentioned this and especially in that MISO SPP region. Are you thinking this is three person horse race, is a three horse race or is this a five or seven?","Benjamin Fowke","I think it\u2019s going to be - everybody has a Transco and everybody wants to build transmission. So, I think it will be very competitive much - many more parties than three.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our next question does come from line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","A couple of questions, first of all, you commented about the potential for moving some of the existing assets into a Transco. Just curious if you can put some numbers around that in terms of size or scale of existing rate base that you move out of the state jurisdiction and into a FERC jurisdiction or subsidiary?","Benjamin Fowke","Well Michael we\u2019re really in early days thinking about those kinds of opportunities and let\u2019s make it clear that they would require state regulatory approval and as we know that can be difficult to achieve, it\u2019s not impossible particularly if you can demonstrate customer value to our regulators which I think in some circumstances we can.","I can\u2019t really give you a number. The guidance that we have said on the call and I would continue to stick with that, as you should think the $4.5 billion that we\u2019re going to spend, most of it would be at the operating company level. I think we have some incremental opportunities to the Transco that would probably be in the latter part of our five year forecast and that would be on top of the $4.5 billion and then of course in the five years that follows I think Transco would play a more predominant role.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Changing topics a little bit and thinking longer term, not necessarily next two to three years, but maybe next 5 to 10, when you look across your system and across your states which of your jurisdictions will have the greatest need for potential new or incremental renewable assets in order to meet the State Renewable Standards and which ones have less of a need?","Benjamin Fowke","Well we\u2019re actually in very good shape to meet the State Renewable Standards. We are ahead of the game, significantly ahead of the game but maybe what you\u2019re referring to is what the EPA rules, where we have to do more. I mean is that what you are kind of driving at?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","No, I\u2019m really kind of thinking about, it\u2019s funny everybody really thinks about the numerator when they are thinking about renewable megawatt hours. They forget that a lot of these are set on a percent of sales. So if you are seeing sales recovery a little bit greater than what was in the forecast the dominator changes and then it may impact what\u2019s actually needed going forward. Just I\u2019m kind of thinking about the bigger picture and really trying to think 5 and 10 years down that road of where you could see or where the state you are in could see a need for incremental renewable RFPs?","Benjamin Fowke","Well I think we are in the \u2013 let me just give you my take on it, clearly the state is going to increase the renewable standards but where we stand today even with -- and sales picking, I don\u2019t see that moving the needle very much. I think that continues to put us in the position where we can add renewable without the pressure to do it now. So that means we can be more choosy and we can bring them on a better price points for our customers and that\u2019s what we have been doing over the last decade and it\u2019s really worked well for us. We\u2019d like to see it continue but I don\u2019t think we are going to be forced into it because of a State Renewable Standard.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And finally once more, an industry question but also specifically for your assets. How do you think about the long term growth rate in O&M for nuclear power plants relative to kind of your total long term O&M growth rate targets for the consolidated entity?","Benjamin Fowke","I mean I obviously it\u2019s been pretty significant over the last five years. We like to think it\u2019s going to flatten now. I think a lot of that will depend you know additional regulations that might come out. If I were to -- we were are going to give you a rough estimate I would say that it\u2019s the nuclear O&M is going to be hard pressed to be as flat as we anticipate the rest of our business, the degree of which I couldn\u2019t really give you any particular insight at this point.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay and any update on kind of your long term O&M targets?","Benjamin Fowke","Yes, I mean we\u2019re going to continue to push the O&M down. You know what our targets for the next five years and I think ultimately you have to have your O&M growth match your sales growth and we continue to think that\u2019s going to be despite the pick-up you know relatively flat and that\u2019s where we want to see our O&M growth go.","Back to nuclear side too I mean I think it\u2019s important to recognize that in a carbon constrained world these nuclear plants are extremely valuable and so, if they require a bit more O&M than the rest of our business I still think they are very good value propositions for our customers.","Operator","And our next question does come from line of David Paz with Wolfe Research.","David Paz - Wolfe Research","Now that you do not need the $700 million of external equity over the five year, how does the mix in your financing plan change? That is like what the rough percentage were from CSO, from new debt and from DRIP?","Teresa Madden","Well we anticipate I mean in terms of we have previously said you know from the DRIP and the benefit plan that was $350 million, just a slight increase to 370 and the remainder would be to spend it through holding company debt. So you can just do that translation. I would say though that the remaining piece that we were talking about you said $700 million and we frankly completed a $175 million of that in the first part of this year. We just finished up our ATM program; so, it\u2019s more in the $500 million range.","David Paz - Wolfe Research","Understood, okay.","Benjamin Fowke","And David about a $130 million of incremental cash from operations too, to offset that.","David Paz - Wolfe Research","And I think you said in your prepared remarks that your current five year capital plan is unchanged or at least not materially changed. Is that correct? And if so, when do you expect to update your capital plan?","Teresa Madden","Yes, that\u2019s I mean that\u2019s correct we\u2019re basically the five year around $14 billion. It will be later this year. Generally we do it in our third quarter call but we will continue to monitor that but that would be the earliest that we would expect.","David Paz - Wolfe Research","And given the discussion early on Transco, is it fair to say that when you grow forward one year that you probably can maintain that $14 billion or at least around that?","Teresa Madden","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s going to be in that area code.","Operator","(Operator Instructions).","Teresa Madden","Well thank you all for participating in our earnings call. Please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team if you\u2019ve any following questions.","Benjamin Fowke","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the conference call for today.

Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions.","This morning, we will review our third quarter results, initiate 2017 guidance, update you on recent business and regulatory developments, and update our five-year capital forecast, financing plans and rate base growth.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today we reported third quarter GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share compared with $0.84 per share last year. Year-to-date, we're $0.07 per share ahead of last year and, as a result, we are narrowing our 2016 guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share from the previous range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. We still anticipate earnings in the middle of the range. We're also initiating 2017 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 4% to 6%.","We had a productive quarter, and we continue to make progress on investment plans and regulatory initiatives. I'll briefly touch on some of the highlights. Today, we are updating our five-year capital forecast and you will notice a significant increase in renewable investments. Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our steel-for-fuel strategy.","Our service territory is unique in its concentration of renewable-rich resources. For example, the capacity factors for win generation are approximately 50% in Minnesota and Texas, and about 45% in Colorado. When you combine high-capacity factors, a strong transmission network, and the extension of the production tax credit, it all translates into low renewable energy cost for our customers.","Today, we can add wind energy, which meets or beats the cost of fossil generation resources. Because of the strong wind resources in our backyard, we have the unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs are offset by fuel savings. Therefore, we are lowering the emission profile of our generation fleet with significant fuel savings, which allows us to grow our renewable portfolio with no impact to customer builds.","A prime example of our steel-for-fuel strategy is the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado. In September, the Colorado Commission approved our request to develop the 600-megawatt wind farm with a capital investment of approximately $1 billion. We will start initial work on the project this year and it's expected to go into service in 2018. Another example is in Minnesota, where the Commission recently approved our resource plan, which includes the early retirements of two coal units at our Sherco facility and the addition of a significant amount of renewable energy.","In accordance with the resource plan, we have issued an RFP to add up to 1,500 megawatts of wind generation. This week, we filed a self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation, which would meet half of that resource need. We believe that our projects reflect competitive pricing, and are confident that the Commission will approve our proposal in the first half of 2017.","We expect both of these wind projects will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel savings for our customers, which will more than offset the capital cost, highlighting the benefit of our steel-for-fuel strategy.","Turning to the operation side of the business, more than a decade ago we partnered with a group of smaller utilities to form CapX2020 and transform the transmission grid in the Upper Midwest. That transformation was made a reality with the recent completion and energizing of 156-mile Hampton-Rochester-La Crosse transmission line. CapX2020 has now invested $1.9 billion in completing four high voltage transmission lines totaling nearly 725 miles.","A fifth project in South Dakota is scheduled for completion in 2017. These transmission projects are addressing reliability needs and increasing access to renewable energy across the Upper Midwest.","I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include, higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, largely due to rate increases and capital rider recovery for infrastructure investments along with sales growth and favorable weather. We also realized a lower effective income tax rate due to higher PTCs from wind projects, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share.","Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions and reductions in excess depreciation reserves, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, and higher interest and O&M expenses, which combined reduced earnings by $0.05 per share.","Our third quarter electric sales came in stronger than expected and increased 1.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. We saw positive sales growth in the residential and C&I classes. We continue to experience strong customer growth of approximately 1% for both our electric and our natural gas businesses.","While we're happy to see a quarter of strong sales, it's a little early to call it a trend and our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales remain relatively flat. Therefore, we remain cautious on the sales outlook and anticipate flat year-over-year sales.","We're very focused on managing our cost structure for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are approximately 1% above last year. We experienced higher storm costs and maintenance expense in the third quarter, and expect full year O&M to be slightly above 2015 actuals. We continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and the use of technology. And we expect to carry this effort into the future.","During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of proceedings across our territories. You'll find more details in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights.","Consistent with our strategy to implement longer-term rate plans in our jurisdictions, we reached a preliminary settlement with the majority of parties in our Minnesota electric rate case, which would provide revenue certainty through 2019. Key terms for the four-year plan include an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, an annual sales true-up, a continued use of all existing riders, a four-year rate case stay-out provision, a property tax true-up and a capital true-up mechanism. We expect an ALJ report in March of 2017 and a final Commission decision in June of 2017. As a reminder, interim rates, subject to refund, are in place while the Commission considers the case.","We're pleased to announce that we've reached a settlement and an agreement in principle in our Texas rate case and hearings have been vacated. We're working on documenting the settlement and plan to file it in the fourth quarter. Although we can't provide any details until the documentation is finalized, we believe that the settlement is positive and reflects a growing constructive regulatory environment in Texas and New Mexico.","Finally, we also have a pending rate case in Wisconsin, where we requested a revised rate increase of approximately $35 million between electric and natural gas. Just yesterday, the Wisconsin Commission verbally approved a combined increase of approximately $27 million, which reflects complete recovery of our requested natural gas rate increase and an adjusted electric rate increase. Final rates will be implemented in January.","Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share. Previously, the range was $2.12 to $2.22 per share. We are also initiating our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS of 4% to 6% annually.","Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. However, a couple of the 2017 assumptions are worth mentioning. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We're assuming sales growth of 0% to 0.5% in 2017, and O&M expenses are expected to stay flat with 2016 projections. This will mark a third year in a row of near-flat O&M, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement of our cost structure.","Finally, we've updated our capital forecast and now expect to invest $18.4 billion over the next five-year period of 2017 through 2021. This forecast drives annual rate-based growth of 5.4% using 2015 as a base. Capital plan reflects $3.5 billion of renewable investment, including the Rush Creek wind farm, our proposal to add 750 megawatts of wind in the Upper Midwest, and incremental renewable generation to capitalize on our steel-for-fuel strategy.","Again, it's important to point out that our capital investment in renewable generation is offset by fuel savings, so there's no impact on the customer builds. Further, we don't plan to issue equity to fund this capital plan due to our strong balance sheet and credit metrics.","In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic, financial, and operational plan. We had a strong quarter and are on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We reached a rate settlement in Minnesota and settlement in principle in our Texas rate case. We're executing on our steel-for-fuel strategy with the approval of the Rush Creek wind project and the submittal of our 750-megawatt wind proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota.","We've established 2017 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective of 4% to 6%. And finally, we've updated our five-year capital forecast, which supports continual infrastructure investment in our service territory and delivers rate base growth of 5.4%.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now open the phone for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question today from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, first quick question if I can follow-up. You talk about the 5.4% rate base. Can you elaborate a little bit on your earned ROE expectations as you start to get some clarity here between settlements across your jurisdictions into 2017 and onwards?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Are you talking about the ROEs we'll earn on the actual incremental renewable?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Where are you \u2013 basically where are you with respect to your ability to get your earned ROE up vis-\u00e0-vis what you guys had talked about at the last Analysts Day?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. So, Julien, you remember when we set a goal that we were going to cut the lag that we experienced between actual and authorized by 50 basis points by 2018, and that goal is still something we're very focused on. Some things have changed, of course. Authorized ROEs have fallen a bit, as you well know. But I think that for us to continue to improve ROEs, we'd really have to cut that lag by more than half and get closer to actually earning the authorized ROEs, which is I think more realistic for us than before because of some of the settlement agreements we've entered into. So, count on us to show steady ROE improvement as we proceed down the five-year path.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Actually, can you comment real quickly on the renewal bucket of CapEx there? Just it seems if I do 19% times the new CapEx number, it might be a little bit higher than I think the couple billion you previously discussed for renewables allocated. Can you kind of walk down what's changed little bit in the CapEx specifically on that element?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, I guess just to walk you through it and we previously were at $15.2 billion, right, base cap. So, the first thing that we did was update it for the approval of Rush Creek project. All right? And then what we've done is we had placed all these, as you may recall, Julien, at NSP(Minn) for some renewable additions. We took those placeholders out and put in the actual CapEx, we believe, we'll get with the approval of at least 750 megawatts of wind. That adds another $700 million to the forecast. So, that should bring you up to about $16.7 billion and then you add $1.5 billion for more steel-for-fuel opportunities that I think we have across all of our jurisdictions. And that should, if I done the math...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","...right, gets you close to where we are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. So, basically, just to be clear though, there are additional undefined opportunities taken to this new plant that you anticipate disclosing or pursuing at another point in time?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. Roughly about $1.5 billion. And, Julien, I think the \u2013 we're confident that those opportunities will become reality, because, I mean, the whole premise of steel-for-fuel is you can do things on an economic basis cheaper than the fossil alternatives. So, in reality, the environmental benefits will be icing on the cake. So, when you're not impacting customer builds and you're driving environmental leadership, it's really a unique position for us to be in.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Ali.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning. Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. First, I wanted to clarify, as you mentioned, Ben, your authorized ROEs, specifically I'm thinking Minnesota, obviously, have come down, part of the settlement. So, when we run the math now and we look at your blended weighted authorized ROE with that 9.2% number for Minnesota baked in there versus what you earned over the 12-month period, what is the lag right now that you have in the overall utility system?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","The overall utility system or NSP(Minn)?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm curious for the overall, but then NSP(Minn) specifically as well.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think this year, Ali, we'll probably earn around 9%, right? And so, I think if you blended all of our authorized ROEs, it'd probably be about 9.6%, roughly around there. So you've got \u2013 so that would be 60 basis points of lag. All right? That's less than what we had before. Remember, when we first initiated, that closed the gap, it was more like 100 basis points of lag.","So, I think the challenge and the opportunity for us, Ali, is to \u2013 with \u2013 for example, in Minnesota, clearly that was a compromised 9.2% is not the ROE we would prefer to have preferred to have. However, when you look at the comprehensive settlement, we have a much better shot than we've ever had before of actually earning our allowed returns. And you'll recall that in Minnesota, we had been lagging, frankly, even more than 100 basis points. So, we'll get at it differently. We've got a lower blended ROE base. But I think with multi-year plans, comprehensive multi-year plans, we can probably do better than just cut the lag in half, and that's the plan.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, in Minnesota strictly, where would you be ending the year running?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Say that again, Ali. You broke up.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm sorry. So, 9% you said you earned across your portfolio, but what would be the ROE earned in just NSP-Minnesota?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","For what period? This year?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","For this year. You've banked 2016 (18:36) earning what?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think it's roughly around 9% as well.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It is 9%. Okay. So, relative to 9.2%, you're pretty much caught up there then?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think, we do \u2013 I will say that, we do have a regulatory amortization asset in 2017 that will create a bit of a headwind in Minnesota, all things equal. So, when we look at 2017, the blended utility ROE is blended for all of our ROE, so probably roughly around 9% again. But again, that amortization falls off in 2017, our cost initiatives continue to gain traction, and we continue to stay focused on two critical aspects of shareholder value, a growing rate base with our steel-for-fuel strategy and keeping our cost as low as they possibly can be as we've done over the last three years, while not sacrificing reliability and not deferring necessary maintenance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And then second on the CapEx numbers, just wanted to clarify two things. One is, if I'm hearing you right, previously the bucket that you had put out there as growth potential CapEx, I think at that time was $2.5 billion, $1 billion was the Colorado wind, and $1.5 billion was everything else. So, if I'm hearing it right, that's all now part of the base program and you've extended it by a year. So just want to be clear, is that correct?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Ali, I think that's right. On the capital program \u2013 this is Bob. On the capital program, we had the base case and the upside capital that we used to disclose. And for clarity purposes, we've put it all in one sort of capital forecast. As we've talked historically about, I think we realized most of that upside case capital, and then we've put additional wind and renewable development opportunities in our forecast.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","So, Ali, I mean, I don't have it in front of me, but that $2.5 billion, you're right. At Rush Creek, it had like, I think, about $300 million of gas reserves. Of course, we're not going to do that now. It had some advanced grid opportunities. I believe that is associated with the North and Minnesota. And then, we had up some, I think, other renewable opportunities.","So, to Bob's point, we basically have achieved the upside CapEx just with renewables. And again, the clarity we've seen with steel-for- fuel is really unique for us. And I think we'll continue to look for opportunities to transition the fleet, achieve remarkable carbon emission reductions at no additional price point to the consumer.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And so that's what I wanted to clarify, that grid modernization and some of the other buckets, are those no longer being pursued, as you mentioned it's all now renewables, or are those still out there somewhere?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No. We anticipate advanced grid in both Colorado and Minnesota. There might be some upside to this capital forecast, but basically that's been captured in the $18.4 billion that you're looking at.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Last question also \u2013 and relative to now your new rate base growth forecast of 5.4%. If I equate that to your EPS growth aspiration of 4% to 6%, it looks like you no longer need a lot of ROE improvement to get there. As long as you can sustain ROE, the rate base growth should drive you at least through the midpoint, maybe higher end of the growth forecast. Am I thinking about that correctly or how are you thinking about that now?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No, Ali, I think you're spot on. I think you take that growth rate. We don't need to issue equity. We have an incredibly strong balance sheet. And so, if we can see the ROE improvements, that will just drive you beyond the 5.4%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning. These guys nailed most of the questions I wanted to ask, but just to be clear, looking at your CapEx forecast now versus your prior CapEx forecast, the biggest delta is renewables and that includes the plant that you've already had approved. The remaining CapEx is the assumption that you get the 750-megawatt self-build approved, or is it that you get the 750-megawatt self-build approved and then there's other placeholder CapEx for further renewables in the plan?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","To get you to the $18.4 billion, you're right about Rush Creek and Colorado, which is approved. It also assumes that we have the opportunity to build half of the RFP. We think our self-build proposals are very compelling. We could also get there through potentially build on transfer, but the assumption is that the capital associated with that RFP, half of that accrues to our shareholders and rate base.","That leaves a delta of about $1.5 billion, which are opportunities that we think are spread across all of our jurisdictions. We certainly could do more than 50% in Minnesota. I think there's more opportunities to do more in Colorado. And frankly, Greg, when you look at the economic price point that we believe \u2013 that we are seeing with wind, I think we have opportunities potentially in Texas and New Mexico too just on the economic merits alone.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So when you came up those \u2013 on the current approval on the self-build proposal, was that some sort of top-down assessment of market opportunity with the risk weighted \u2013 I mean, did you sort of start with the market opportunity and say we think this is the potential pie, this is what we can achieve on a risk-weighted basis over time or how did you come up with that number?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. You broke up at the very beginning. Just asking how we derive that we can have half of the 1,500 megawatts?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","How did you come up with the remaining $1.5 billion sort of placeholder CapEx as being a realistic expectation?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, there's almost infinity when you're saving customer's money and achieving environmental benefits at the same time. So, it's just really, I think, just an analysis of the additional opportunities, transmission constraints, operational-type considerations. When we go across all of our jurisdictions, I think it's a very realistic opportunity.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Last question, what's the outside date in terms of timing for getting the approval on the self-build option in the two jurisdictions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, we already have approval in Colorado. So, that's done. And then in Minnesota, we expect to have that decision, I believe, is the second quarter of 2017, correct?","Unknown Speaker","That's our goal, yeah.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic. Thank you, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to focus on rate base growth like some of the other questions, but in particular the kind of, I think, accelerated nature of that rate base growth within a potential 2016 to 2021 plan. So, if you look at your Minnesota RFP, you have anticipated startup construction for some of those projects in the middle of 2017. And then them coming online kind of loosely before 2020. Is there a potential to, if you're successful there, do that faster? And then when you combine that with the Colorado wind project coming online in, I think, the fourth quarter of 2018 really frontload or find that some of the rate base growth is frontloaded toward the 2018 to 2019 period?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Maybe something in 2019. But, I think the practical realities of construction seasons, et cetera, probably \u2013 I mean, I think we've got our best estimate.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And secondly, on the dividend, when you look at your capital plan here, that's increased a lot since the prior one and you combine that with the fact that you don't need, I think, any equity internal or external. How do you think about your 5% to 7% dividend growth guidance that you had previously laid out?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think it's pretty safe and pretty sustainable. I think \u2013 as you know, this was a deliberate strategy that we had. We embarked upon an aggressive \u2013 at the time, aggressive CapEx spend a decade ago, and we deliberately, during that timeframe, grew our dividend slower than our earnings growth. And that created a fortress balance sheet for us.","So, now we have a modest payout ratio, 60%, 61% payout ratio. I think that's pretty low compared to our peers. It gives us a lot of what I would call dry powder. So count on the 5% to 7%. But what we would have is, if interest rates start to rise and you see kind of the industry headwinds that would come with that, we certainly could step back and work with our board and determine if there's something else we need to do. I'm not saying we're going to do that, but it's just when you have a strong balance sheet deliberately created, it creates far more opportunities to reward shareholders. And that's something we're pretty proud of, quite frankly.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one more real quick, if I could. When you think about rolling forward your EPS growth CAGR potentially on the fourth quarter call, what kind of constraints might there be there on the regulatory front or on the Minnesota RFP front that might kind of be taken into consideration by you there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I'm not quite sure -","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In terms of anything that would kind of hold you back in kind of releasing that number or caveats to the growth rate as a result of waiting for regulatory decisions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Chris, I think that guidance we provide today is going to \u2013 we expect to be consistent with fourth quarter on any roll forward in terms of capital and earnings and dividend. We don't expect that to change consistent with past practices. So, we do expect regulatory outcomes that are reasonable. We lay out of a host of assumptions that go into our 2017 guidance in our long-term earnings guidance in our earnings release today. And we expect those are good assumptions for 2017.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good. I was wondering in terms of regulation around these renewable project or rate regulation around these. What's the current method that you expect to go forward with, i.e., is it just your traditional backward looking type of rate filings or is there a potential there to convince regulators that with these multi-billion type of investments, you could get rate riders or some kind of return on QIP, something like that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think what we're talking about here in Minnesota would be eligible for rider recovery. We've had those mechanisms in place for a while. So, I think recovery will be concurrent. The $1.5 billion that I talk about, that will just depend on what jurisdictions we do that in. Some will be eligible for riders, some we might propose some sort of enhanced type recovery mechanisms, as you suggest, Travis. So, I think we're in really good shape with the renewable spend in getting recovery that doesn't have lag associated with it.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Similarly, Travis, in Colorado, the recovery of the Rush Creek wind farm is through riders as well.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And one more general question. Obviously, the fuel-for-steel (sic) [steel-for-fuel] (31:53) is a nice strategy for you guys. Is there any pushback on the regulatory front? Is there anybody saying, no, we shouldn't be doing this or we shouldn't be allowing Xcel to be doing this?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I don't know. I think people are pretty excited about it, actually. I mean, when you can show \u2013 let's talk about the Upper Midwest. When you can show regulators the plan to achieve 60% carbon reduction and do that at no incremental price points from a more traditional plant, it's pretty exciting. And, no, we haven't seen pushback at all. We've seen a lot of excitement. In fact, I expect people to say, can you do more, which is usually the way these things work. And so, no, I think it's created really good alignment with our stakeholders, quite frankly.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. How are you?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You said one of the drivers in the quarter was a lower tax rate because of higher PTCs. Is that a function of \u2013 I think the wind was a little weaker than normal last year and is more normal this year?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Paul, this is Bob. We put two wind farms into service in 2016. So, year-over-year effective tax rate is going to be lower due to the PTCs for those two farms.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","There's not \u2013 I'm not sure how the rate making works, but is there exposure to a low wind regime if you have a particularly weak quarter, or does that flow through the fuel cost?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","There's no exposure.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Angie. How are you?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","How are you? Good morning. So, just going back to the renewables being added to the rate base versus the lack of growth in power demand. I mean, I understand that renewables look cheaper than conventional power plants. But what happens with the assets that you have on the rate base, and when there's no growth in power demand, then you keep adding generation assets?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, Angie, I think that's a really good question, but let me try to answer it this way. I think what we're really doing with wind particularly is just really buying the fuel we're going to use tomorrow on sale today. So, when you think about it, I mean, it's not that it doesn't open up the dialogue for early retirement of coal plants, but essentially what you're doing is you're displacing fossil fuels with wind. So you might still have the generation plant, the fossil generation plant, but you don't have to use it as much natural gas, even coal, when you're displacing that fuel with wind fuel. Does that make sense to you?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","It completely does. Just my question would be more \u2013 I mean, you could buy this wind power from an outside providers that could probably use higher leverage on that project, and granted the cost of capital will be probably slightly higher than yours. But, again, the leverage ratios would be higher. So, net-net, I mean, the cost of power would probably be similar. And I know that that would be an earnings-neutral exercise for Xcel, but I'm just trying to figure out from a regulatory risk perspective, is adding renewables to the rate base in the absence of load growth is actually a low-risk growth strategy.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I mean, I think \u2013 I mean, whether it's contracted for or added through rate base, I don't think that influences very much your concern. I think maybe broader-based. I don't think our rate base self-build proposals are going to \u2013 they're going to be cost competitive. Even with the leverage that others use, of course, banking on our strong balance sheet to support that, there is an element to that. And I think our regulators are well aware of that and appreciate the benefits of utility ownership. So, I really think that when you pencil out the numbers, you see how compelling \u2013 particularly when you do it on a fully holistic basis, how compelling our proposals are.","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Angie, (36:40) -","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","It's also important to recognize...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","...that there is \u2013 some of these wind resources are being added to reflect the fact that there are coal plants being retired in the future. So, we're just taking opportunity to capture the full PTC. So, maybe the wind comes on service a little before some of the coal retirements hit that circle. So, I think we're trying to accomplish that.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. And, Angie, I think that's a \u2013 Paul made a great point, because when we're talking about early retirement of coal plants, this is our resource plan. And we're the ones that are leading the de-carbonization of our fleet. And I think we will show that we can build wind competitively, and I think we've earned the right to own wind in our backyard, and it's all part of an overall plan. And again, I think it does require alignment with your regulators, but I think we have it.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Angie.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Zhou (37:45) with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Hi. It's Andy Levi.

I guess, again, it's \u2013 the whole scheme of things it's not that important, but just why the $5 billion? Because I guess we're coming up with a little bit less like $3.5 billion that's based on your cash flows. Are deferred taxes coming down a little bit on the cash flow statement or what's \u2013 I mean, just based on the numbers that we're running, I'm just wondering why $5 billion versus like (38:40).","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Brian, do you want to answer that?","Brian J. Van Abel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Andy, this is Brian Van Abel. I think it could be part in terms of the tax (38:49) over a couple of years. When you think that we're going to start using that deferred tax asset that could be part of it. But overall, in the slide that we show, we show our cash from operations that we generate, and we have in there is consistent with our expectations.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. We come up a little bit less but not a big deal. and then the second question for Ben. So, once you get through this final order in Minnesota, obviously, it seems that the ROEs are improving. You have tremendous amount of opportunities on the CapEx side. It seems that you \u2013 as a company, your managers have very good visibility as far as O&M costs and other operational costs, and seem to be doing a very good job there both currently and going forward. You have a growth rate out there \u2013 as you get into 2017 and 2018, what are your thoughts on the growth rate? Does it generally stay the same? Are there opportunities to potentially raise the growth rate or at least raise the bottom end of it as your ROEs improve and these projects come online?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think \u2013 Andy, as you know, I think we've got \u2013 if we can execute on both the rate base growth and the ROE improvement, we're going to be at the top of that range, maybe potentially beyond it. And that's what we're going to focus on in the next \u2013 in next year and the years to come is driving that. And we'll let things fall into place as they may.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Great. Thank you very much and you guys, again, are doing a great job.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How are you? I wanted to \u2013 first of all, just on the Minnesota case, is there any possibility that people haven't come on board with the settlement could be coming on as a \u2013 is there any potential that you could wrap up the regulatory process before the schedule that you have now, if it could be accelerated at all?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's a question I ask my regulatory team all the time. I mean, there's always a possibility, but I think the reality is, because it wasn't a unanimous settlement, you've got to go through the process and we're going through that process right now. So, we'll look for those opportunities, but I mean, quite frankly, I think you should just count on the schedule that we put forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with the steel-for-fuel, I'd like to just review this a little bit, a little closer. So, when you say that the steel renewables are cheaper than the fossil fuel, that includes for the renewables the production tax credits and then everything there.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","It doesn't include the cost of carbon, is that correct or does it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's correct. No, it doesn't.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And if really only the fuel component that you're talking about \u2013 piggybacking off of Angie's question that, is the fact that you're just not burning the fuel that \u2013 in and of itself that pretty much is the offset?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think the fundamental when we look at it, it's just swapping fuel for, in this case, wind fuel, okay? But what it sets up going down the road, Paul, is the dialogue that you can have and we've already made that \u2013 with that \u2013 some of that dialogue already in Minnesota about retirement of coal plants. And then you talk about how are you going to replace those coal plants. Our thought is that you do it with gas generation. You don't necessarily have to do megawatt for megawatt, and that's a function of your sales forecast. But the fuel swap alone will work, but then it sets up the dialogue about ultimately what your portfolio is going to look like.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","You've already anticipated my question actually, so I don't know why you keep going there. So, I mean \u2013 so when we're thinking about this, it would sound like there may be additional benefits if there was a cost of carbon. If there is a replacement in terms of actually O&M perhaps or \u2013 I mean, any other sort of incremental things that could actually be more than just an offset, it could actually be seen, if you took other things into account, a net benefit for customers. Am I wrong?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No, I think you're right. Now, cost of carbon, of course, it's an exercise outside of the pure economics, right? So...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I mean, you're implying a societal benefit and that sort of thing, which we're not opposed to. But what we're focused on is just, it is just the straight up numbers of what we can do capturing 100% PTC with wind with fuel. And then that can allow you to have further dialogues around, as I mentioned, the earlier shutdown of coal plants, the O&M and all the other things that go with that. You start to design your portfolio to be more load following, because if you look at where we think we're going to be in 2030 and with our carbon reductions, I think we have \u2013 in the Upper Midwest we'll have 15% of our energy mix from coal. And it's \u2013 you need to make sure your generation portfolio has been designed in a way that you can accommodate these additional renewable resources without sacrificing reliability. That's all part of our planning process. I mean \u2013 so, the short answer to your question was yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. No, no. Thank you. And then just in terms of this steel-for-fuel, this is a \u2013 your fuel assumptions are the forward curves, is that what we should think about when you're saying that \u2013 or is there some proprietary fuel? In other words, I mean, when -","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I think that's right. That's right. And when I say we can do it cheaper, I'm also \u2013 I mean, a bit more aggressive than that. I mean, you couldn't go out today and lock in a 10-year strip cheaper than we could \u2013 on gas cheaper than we could lock in wind. And then, if you look at fuel forecast, which the blended \u2013 the forecast that you talk about, tends to have fuel escalating in the future. Quite frankly, I don't know if that's going to happen. But what we have today is so compelling that it almost \u2013 that the fuel would have to fall off quite a lot for us to say if we didn't have \u2013 it didn't actually save customers' money.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And this is with current technology on the wind side as opposed to some \u2013 as we've seen improvements in that area, you're not banking anything on that either of these? Any potential...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I do think \u2013 here's what we believe. We believe solar and wind will continue to fall in price, the continuous improvement we've seen. However, the PTCs, as you know, start to fall off at 20% each year after this year. And so, I think the prices we are, hopefully, going to lock in for our customers today at 100% PTC, even with the technological improvements, you will not see prices this strong again until probably the \u2013 or this low again rather until probably the mid-20s.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Well, thank you very much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's why wind is on sale. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. I wanted to \u2013 we've covered a lot of topics in Q&A. Just in terms of wind, you've had a lot of success in Colorado and Minnesota, and you've mentioned in the past some potential for further growth in wind in some of your other jurisdictions. Are there milestones, things we should be watching for, ways to sort of think about that opportunity to put a little bit more specifics around that in terms of what you might do there or is it a little bit further out? Do you need to do a lot more work before that could be realized or is this something that we should be looking for more near term?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Define near term.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, fair point. Different points of view (47:45) on that, but I'm just curious.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Stephen, I would characterize it as, if you look at the capital forecast in the earnings release, we put our best guess as to when those dollars could and would be spent. So, that's our likely \u2013 if you take into account regulatory approval and \u2013 further work, regulatory approval and construction cycle, those are our best estimates at this point.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. That's really all I had. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shelby Tucker with RBC Capital Markets.","Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Shelby.","Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC","In your 2016 financing plan, it seems that now you plan to issue about $800 million of (48:32) debt in the fourth quarter. I'm guessing that's (48:35) to fund equity needs of the utilities given the higher CapEx program. How much more debt capacity do you think you have at the parent as you look to fund equity needs over the next five years?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","So, if you take into account the capital forecast that's embedded in the earnings release, you'll see our expected debt issuance is against our cash flow from operations, I think that's our best guess for what the capital plan and the financing plan looks like for the next five years.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Shelby, maybe let me \u2013 I don't want to be the CFO or the Treasurer here, so please correct me, guys. But I mean...","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You've been both things.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","When I look at our credit metrics under this plan, they stay very strong. And so, that again, I think, speaks well to the balance sheet that we have.","Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then is there any \u2013 do any of the jurisdictions ever question you on the level of debt you take on the parent?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No, because it's still \u2013 Shelby, it's very modest. And as you know, we've always had the philosophy, there is a benefit of strength in numbers. You get a \u2013 if you're an operating utility and as part of a larger group, you do get a consolidation benefit, provided there isn't excessive leverage at the HoldCo, and we're not even close to that. All of our utilities benefit from being part of a bigger group. And that's always been our approach and that will continue to be our approach. We would never do anything that would be harmful to the credit ratings of our utilities. And I think our track records speaks for itself on that.","Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions.","This morning, we will review our 2015 first quarter results, reaffirm earnings guidance for 2015 and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webpage. In addition, we will post a video on our website of Teresa summarizing financial results later this morning.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. First quarter 2015 ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which exclude a charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota Commission in the Monticello nuclear prudence review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.30 per share. Management believes ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of charges related to the prudence review, provide a more meaningful comparison. As a result, the comments on today's call will focus on first quarter ongoing earnings of $0.46 per share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, I'm going to provide a business update, review several recent regulatory outcomes, speak to you about our legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas and discuss our recently-increased dividend growth objective. Teresa will provide more details on some of these items.","We're beginning 2005 (sic) [2015] (2:03) with a solid start. While timing and weather differences led to some variability in the quarter, our earnings remain on track and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. In February, we increased our dividend almost 7%. We also raised our annual dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and established a formal payout target of 60% to 70%. These actions reflect our confidence in the company's long-term strategic plan, the strength of our balance sheet and our projected cash flows.","From an operational perspective, we met key milestones in our transmission business as we energized the final sections on two of our major CapEx 2020 projects, bringing the lines into service on time and on budget. The region will derive meaningful benefits from these valuable assets. We're also pleased to be named the Number-One Wind Provider in the country for the 11th straight year by AWEA. We're pleased to be included in Forbes Magazine of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America and to be recognized as the Best for Vets Employer.","From a regulatory perspective, we brought three major proceedings to a close. In Colorado, the Commission approved our three-year electric regulatory plan. This constructive multiyear settlement provides rate certainty for our customers and revenue certainty for the company. This represents the second multiyear plan we have implemented in our Colorado electric business and we believe that this agreement can serve as blueprint for our pending natural gas rate case.","Turning to Minnesota, we continue to believe we acted prudently throughout the construction process at our Monticello nuclear facility. The important takeaway is that our customers and the region will benefit from a safe, reliable and diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, for many years to come. While we disagree with some of the Commission's findings, and we will need to review the final order, it does represent resolution of an issue that has been an overhang on the company.","Finally, in our inaugural, multiyear rate case in Minnesota, we were encouraged that the Commission generally agree with the ALJ recommendations in the proceeding, and supported the company's position on many of the key issues. While we would have preferred to avoid a 2016 regulatory filing and we felt we provided a path to do so, we believe the final result was a reasonable outcome. However, we continue to believe there is an opportunity for future improvement and streamlining of the regulatory process. We feel that more specific legislation will facilitate this, and provide greater predictability for customers and the company.","In order to achieve the ambitious state and federal policy initiatives that are quickly approaching, it's important that the company have additional tools at its disposal to meet these evolving requirements. As a result, we've been proactively working with key stakeholders on a multiyear plan regulatory bill currently being considered by the Minnesota Legislature. Some of the key components of this regulatory compact include: expanding to a five-year multiyear plan, allowing for formulaic recovery of capital investments, recovery of O&M expenses based on an electric industry price index, continuation of interim rates while the plan's under consideration, and protections in the event of unforeseen developments.","The proposed multiyear plan legislation is contained in the omnibus House energy bill. The state omnibus energy bill does not include the multiyear plan legislation. The energy bills have passed the floor vote in both the House and the Senate. The bills will now be reconciled in Conference Committee, and we expect the final bill will include the multiyear plan legislation. Once the Committee has reconciled the bill, it will be sent back to the Senate and House for a vote. And while the process remains fluid, we are cautiously optimistic regarding its passage. If successful, we will look to incorporate components of the bill, as appropriate, in our rate filings in the future.","In Texas, we've worked with various stakeholders on a bill that addresses regulatory lag. The regulatory bill passed out of the House Committee earlier this month, and we're waiting for it to be scheduled for a vote on the floor. The proposed legislation provides for the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions and supports the implementation of more timely surcharges. However, industrial customers continue to have concerns with the bill, and we are currently working to resolve these issues. We're hopeful that the bill will be passed into law, as it is an important step towards reducing regulatory lag and would help to facilitate investment in the growing area.","Late last year, we discussed our plans to focus on incremental growth opportunities in transmission and natural gas assets. Recently, we've been socializing the concept of rate basing natural gas reserves in Colorado. We're working with stakeholders to see if we can schedule a series of discussions to explore the concept of rate basing natural gas reserves, and how to best take advantage of the current low natural gas price for the benefit of customers and the company alike.","Finally, I wanted to brief you on \u2013 about an exciting new investment that we're pursuing. Courtenay is a 200-megawatt wind power purchase agreement that NSP-Minnesota signed in 2013. For various reasons, the developer has decided to exit the project, providing us an opportunity to pursue ownership of the wind farm and to ensure that our customers will benefit from the addition of cost-effective wind generation.","We are seeking regulatory approval in Minnesota and North Dakota to take this project over and eventually place it in rate base. The facility is expected to be in service at the end of 2016 and cost approximately $300 million. The project is not included in our current five-year capital forecast, and we don't anticipate needing to issue any incremental equity to finance it. We've made significant progress in the first four months of this year, and I look forward to making even more progress in the coming months.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share, versus $0.52 per share last year. While the quarter was subject to some timing differences and an adverse weather comparison, the results were in line with our expectations. The most-significant driver in the quarter was improved electric margin that resulted from new rates. However, the weather comparison versus 2014 was significant causing a $0.05 per share negative variance. Increased O&M and depreciation, along with the higher effective tax rate, were also notable offsets.","Now, let me provide an update on sales in the economies in our local service territories. Weather-normalized electric sales increased at 0.5% for the quarter and natural gas sales rose 2.9%. In the first quarter of 2014, we experienced very cold weather. As we all know, the weather normalization process is not an exact science. And it is possible that our first quarter 2014 weather-normalized sales may have been somewhat distorted. With that in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2015 electric weather-adjusted sales growth assumptions of 1%.","Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 1.7% due primarily to growth in the oil, gas and sand mining-related businesses. Electric sales at SPS increased 1.9%, driven by growth in both the residential and C&I classes. While we are closely monitoring the impact of oil prices on production activity, the Permian Basin has been resilient.","PSCo's electric sales increased 0.4%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class due to the expansions in the healthcare and technology services sectors. Finally, NSP-Minnesota's electric sales decreased 0.5% as usage declines more than offset new customer addition in both the residential and C&I classes. Overall, our service territories remain healthy, particularly relative to the rest of the nation. Consolidated unemployment in our regions is 4.2%, well below the national average of 5.6%. The number of jobs in our regions grew 2.5% during the quarter compared with 2.3% for the nation.","Focusing on the earnings for the quarter, ongoing electric margin increased $40 million. Key drivers included non-fuel riders that increased margin by $34 million, largely reflecting the Clean Air Clean Jobs rider in Colorado, which became effective January 1, 2015. The implementation of final and interim rates increased margin by $23 million and increased net transmission revenue, which improved margin by $7 million. Offsetting these positive factors was an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $25 million as well as a few other less-significant items.","It is worth noting that during the first quarter of 2015, we took a conservative approach to revenue recognition. During the quarter, we continue to book revenues at the 2014 interim rate level and did not assume that the Minnesota Commission would approve our netting proposal, which would have increased revenues by just over $10 million. If the MPEC (12:26) approves our interim rate netting proposal, we will record revenue in that period at the higher authorized level retroactive to January 1, 2015.","When thinking about margin comparisons for the reminder of the year, it is important to remember that as we move through the balance of 2014, we recorded increasingly-larger potential refunds to customers, ending the year with a rate increase consistent with the ALJ recommendations. Due to these timing factors, we expect an improving margin comparison in Minnesota for the reminder of the year.","Margins on the natural gas side of our business decreased by $12 million for the quarter. This is primarily due to the negative weather comparison, which more than offset higher rider revenue and retail sales growth. O&M expenses increased $26 million in the quarter. The higher level is almost entirely driven by the timing of planned outages. We remain confident that we will achieve our annual O&M growth assumption of zero to 2%. Depreciation expense increased $27 million for the quarter due to capital investment and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota. Finally, other taxes increased about $12 million, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado.","Next, we'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. During the quarter, as Ben indicated, we made significant progress with our regulatory agenda, resolving three key proceedings. Beginning with Minnesota and our multiyear rate filing, we were pleased that the Commission recognized the strength of the company's arguments and largely accepted the recommendations of the ALJ.","Based on our interpretation of the Commission's oral deliberations, we estimate a total revenue increase of $168 million, which compares to our revised request of $221 million. The Commission approved a 9.72% ROE, and equity ratio of 52.5%, and a three-year decoupling pilot. We view this as a reasonable outcome and expect the final written order in May.","We also concluded final deliberations in our Monticello prudence review. The Commission approved a full return of $415 million of the project's $748 million total cost. However, allowed recovery of the investment with no returns on the remaining $333 million. As a result, we've recorded one-time pre-tax charge of $129 million during the quarter. We estimate that the 2015 ongoing pre-tax impact of the decision will be approximately $16 million on a total company basis.","Finally, in February, we were pleased that the Colorado Commission approved the settlement in our electric rate case. The final decision reflected an overall increase of $53 million in 2015 and ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we have implemented forward-looking riders for our Clean Air Clean Jobs and transmission-related spending. The agreement covers 2015 through 2017 and continues the productive multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012.","In March, the PSCo filed a multiyear natural gas rate case covering 2015 through 2017. We are requesting a 2015 rate increase of about $41 million and subsequent step increases of $8 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2017. The requested ROE is 10.1% in 2015 and 2016, rising to 10.3% in 2017. In addition, we filed for a five-year extension of our pipeline system integrity rider that drives revenue increases of $22 million and $21 million in 2016 and 2017. We filed the gas case with principles generally consistent with the recently-settled electric case, which we hope will provide the framework for our first multiyear natural gas rate plan in Colorado.","In our Texas rate case, the schedule had been abated for 30 days in order to allow for settlement discussions. However, we haven't been successful in reaching a settlement; therefore, the procedural schedule to process the case was established on Monday. Regardless, the parties have agreed, rates will be effective in mid-June. Finally, in South Dakota, interim rates of about $16 million went into effect on January 1. We currently are in settlement negotiations with parties, and expect final rates to be effective midyear.","This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions, as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed. For more information, please see our earnings release.","With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are pleased to be making progress with our regulatory agenda. We have gained substantial clarity in recent months, and are cautiously optimistic regarding the potential success of our legislative initiatives. We are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are excited about the Courtenay Wind Farm investment opportunity. We continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to up to 2%. We are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually. And finally, we are pleased to raise our dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%.","So, operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Ali Agha at SunTrust.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ali.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hey. How are you? First off, just to clarify a little bit on Minnesota, Ben or Teresa. So, when we factor in the rate case, and that was just completed, does that make a dent as far as your lag in 2015 is concerned? (19:36) an appreciable improvement in earned ROE this year, or not, versus 2014?","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ali, we're going to be pretty consistent where we've been at kind of in the mid-8%s, maybe a little bit higher than that, but it'll be pretty consistent with where we have been at.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I see. And then, from \u2013 just to understand the timing, when would you expect the legislative actions to be completed? And then, how does that relate to the timing of when you would make your next rate case filing there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Unless it goes to extended session, it wraps up in May. And obviously, we've talked about filing a 2016 rate case, Ali. So, we'll see what actually is passed, and then we'll incorporate that into our thoughts going forward. To your former point, I think ,closing the regulatory gap, this 2016 case will be where you'll start to see that improvement \u2013 and that's what we've thought all along.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just to \u2013 in terms of timing, Ali, we would expect to be filing right around the November 1 timeframe, so that interim rates for 2016 would go into effect at the first of that year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah. And then, a bigger picture on this lag issue, as you reiterate, the goal is a 50 basis point reduction in lag by 2018. And can you remind us, embedded in the 2015 guidance, what is the total lag, in terms of a starting point we should be thinking about?","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ali, right now, our lag's running close to 100% (sic) [100 basis points] (21:12), but we're closing 50 basis points, and we expect the trajectory to be lower in the first years, and graduating up to the 2018 timeframe. So, only modest as an initial start.","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Ali, that was 100 basis points.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","100 basis points.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What did I say?","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Percent.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I said 100%?","Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That would be bad.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that would be bad.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And my last question. I know that you don't have any equity plans over the five-year CapEx cycle. And so, when you talk about the earnings CAGR, I believe it's 4% to 6% over that five-year period, from the normalized 2014 base. And the rate base CAGR over that five-year period is 4.7%. Am I correct in those numbers?","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well maybe, Ali, just to clarify, we do have some equity issuances through our DRIP and our benefit plans and that's about $75 million a year. But you're correct about the rate base. If we add Courtenay and we're probably just slightly under 5%, in terms of that, and growth continues at 4% to 6% in terms of earnings projection.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, the things that are happening in the short run here are the filings for the approval of the wind farm. Do you know what the \u2013 is there a statutory timeframe under which you expect to get a decision from those two jurisdictions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think there's a statutory timeframe, but there's a practical timeframe and we would need to get the decision so that we can meet the construction cycle by late summer.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Late summer. And then, the legislative session, you indicated, already ends end of May. And then, what is the \u2013 what do we have to look forward to in terms of milestones with regard to your seeking to potentially rate base gas reserves? And if you were to get a program equal to your aspirations out of the gate, how would that be \u2013 what will you be looking that in terms of size and investment?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think there's a lot of unknowns around that, Greg, to be frank with you. And like we said, I mean, what we're trying to do is set up the discussions in Colorado. Focus then on the LDC gas business, get some consensus around that and then potentially move forward in 2016. The size and all of that will be based upon those dialogs that we hope to have.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. But you're starting with the concept of procuring reserves for retail supply to the LDC business, not procuring reserves for power generation fuel?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Greg.","Operator","And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, perhaps, the first quick question going back to Minnesota legislation. When you think about the time period that you could stay out and implementing it, in theory, in this 2016 case, what would you be \u2013 what kind of period are we talking about as best you understand it? And then \u2013 and perhaps a more relevant question here. If you don't get the legislation by the end of May or what have you, as you think about the 2016 case, is there any potential to have a multiyear stay out under any variety of the scenarios that would exclude legislation?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, Julien, we had a path to stay out of 2016, but it was going to be based upon how we handled certain depreciation reserves. And so, when that opportunity was not taken, it put us in a position, as you know, that we are going to file the 2016 case. Now, we have mitigation tools still available to us. If the legislation pass, we might have more tools, longer timeframes that we can do. But even if the legislation doesn't pass, we are going to follow a multiyear plan in 2016. And when we look at our spend profile and our recovery needs, I think the longer the plan is, the more modulation and mitigation we can use for the benefit of our customers and for clarity for us. So, I think we've got a pretty solid path to start to close that regulatory lag. It's been really pronounced in Minnesota. Legislation will help, but the traditional way to file a rate case, although laborious, also works.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And perhaps, I know this is very tough to ask. But how do you think about collapsing the rate lag, just organically given smaller rate case prospectively in 2016? I mean, how much of the improvement here is simply, again, just another filing with a more modest ask and having some of those mitigation tools versus having a legislation in hand and leveraging some of those tools that enables you? I mean, what kind of delta are we talking about? And I know that's putting a lot (26:44).","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty hard to quantify that, I would say. I mean, let me just say that the majority of the ask in 2016, whether we use legislative initiatives or what we have available to use now, is going to be capital driven. So, Julien, I think that always helps. Capital is always less controversial than O&M. The advantage, though, of a longer timeframe is that we have more opportunities to sculpt the capital to \u2013 and the mitigation tools to take advantage of the fact that the pace of investment does start to slow down. And again, what we've talked about before is that we really need to have longer timeframes where we're not in front of the regulator, look to just kind of proceeding trying to get rate relief, because there is a lot of policy discussions that we want to have and, frankly, I think our Commission wants to have with us. But we can't do that right now. So, that was the disappointment really of having to follow 2016 case, as there is a lot going on and it kind of makes it harder to have those dialogs. But the dialogs will happen. So, did I answer your question, hopefully?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","As best you could, I appreciate it. And then, maybe in separate direction here...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That means no.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","It's a little bit easier. A little bit more palatable. Can you comment around SPS and, just generally speaking, the environment to-date in terms of the commodity impact, et cetera? What are you seeing prospectively in terms of capital need?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In SPS, is that what you're asking?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, just given the lower oil price environment.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It really hasn't had much of an impact at all. The Permian Basin is a good place from an economic standpoint. We understand that there is more supply chain initiatives from the developers squeezing out more cost. But the other thing \u2013 and I think that's very important to recognize \u2013 is that we had a tremendous backlog. So, you've got well \u2013 we've got the majority of the wells that stood on \u2013 are still running on very expensive diesel and things like that. So, there is a lot of backlog. It gives us time to catch up. Ultimately, I think prices will rebound it a bit. But I think we're in pretty good shape there. And the other thing that's happening is, in that area of the country, there is other economic activity as well. So, still going pretty strong and the sales growth expectations down in that region are pretty strong and we think will continue to be so.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Travis.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Hi. Wondering as you went through the 2014-2015 rate stuff in Minnesota, were there lessons learned through that whole process that you expect to embed in the 2016 case? Anything that you might have asked before that you won't ask for now, any adjustments that you'll make based on those negotiations, absent the legislation and that whole side of it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess it reaffirmed to us that we need to change the regulatory process. That's why we're seeking the legislation. It doesn't allow us to have the dialogs, Travis, that we mentioned. We need \u2013 it's a new world. Our policymakers want us to do more and, frankly, we are doing more. We filed, I think, a very transformational resource plan at the end of last year. We're going to move forward and be very aggressive on renewables. We want to make sure we do that with efficiency in mind, using large-scale renewables.","It's tough to do that, as I mentioned, in the rate case. I guess specifically, we need to \u2013 we probably self-mitigated a little bit as we filed that rate case, recognizing that it was a big ask. And that puts \u2013 those things we didn't ask for will just resurface in 2016, and we'll ask for what we need. And as I mentioned, it's capital-based. These are investments that I think everybody wants us to make. So, we've got to update the regulatory compact in keeping with the times. And I think that's what the e21 Initiative was about, and we're proposing how we implement that in Minnesota.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Maybe just to add to that, and I think you touched on it, Ben. I mean one thing that was definitely reconfirmed was the tolerance for the customer bill...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And the legislation clearly will have \u2013 assuming it goes forward \u2013 have parameters that will help us, in terms of the longer term, to manage through that, with the capital investment that Ben mentioned.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And just \u2013 you need more tools, you need to have different kinds of dialogs, and that's what we would get with legislation. But we can do it the old fashioned way too.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just not as efficient.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. Great. And then, what's your latest thinking on competitive transmission? Any project you're looking at out there, any \u2013 is that at all part of the growth strategy still?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We don't \u2013 as you know, we haven't assumed \u2013 what we have in our transmission CapEx is \u2013 it's state-regulated, and it's identified. It's not pie in the sky. So, we don't have competitive transmission. But there are \u2013 but the opportunities are fewer, as you know, than what, I think, people were talking about a year ago. But there's some opportunities, and we're looking at a relatively small opportunity in MISOs, and potentially some smaller opportunities in SPP, which I think will give us a chance to understand how competitive bidding will work. Relatively small right now. I think, as the EPA rules get clarified and both SPP and MISO refine their projects, or refine the needs, we'll have more opportunities to bid competitively.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We still think it'll be there, it's just delayed a bit.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Exactly, Teresa.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Angie.","Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hello. How are you?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I just want to go back again to this Minnesota legislation. I mean we've been following it, and so here are a couple of concerns that we have. First of all, it seems like the legislature is split in Minnesota. And so, why do you feel convinced or hopeful that both House and the Senate can agree on the version of a bill that will actually include those multiyear rate cases? And more importantly, so we had this issue in Colorado already, that the regulators then didn't necessarily think that the new law is really binding, it's more of a suggestion. So, how likely is it that we do get a bill, and then the regulators in Minnesota think that it's still an option for them to pursue or not, and then we may end up in yet another rate case?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, couple questions that you asked. First of all, as we all know, sausage making and the political process can be kind of messy. And that's what we are in. But what we're being told, and what we understand is, while there is controversy between the House and Senate bill, and that's the difference between Republican versus DFL controlled, and their different interests, the multiyear plan provisions really aren't controversial. So, when this thing goes to Conference Committee, we think it's a very good possibility that the provisions of the multiyear plan remain. While you can only be cautiously optimistic, because it is a political process, and if there were things in the final bill that was passed by both House and Senate that were unappealing to the Governor, you always have a risk of veto. So, that's the reality there.","In terms of whether it will be viewed by the Commission as an option versus a mandate, I think, one, you'd have to look and see how the legislation is finalized. But I also believe that the Commission is frustrated with how the process works in Minnesota to sell (35:30). So, I think you kind of saw that as the Commission was thinking about the opportunity that we said to stay out of 2016. And I'm not sure that they felt they were \u2013 it was quite ready. And so, with legislation, even if it's an option versus a mandate, I think, they feel much more comfortable with that.","We have Chris Clark here, I don't know if, Chris, you want to add to that?","Christopher B. Clark - President, Northern States Power Company - Minnesota, Xcel Energy, Inc.","I'd agree with that. I think that Commissioners have been interested in engaging in that dialog you talked about earlier Ben. And so, I think the legislation will be viewed as tool that helped to enable that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And then, I mean maybe it's just my understanding of the House version of the bill. Is that \u2013 you would still need to file rate cases according to this bill, right? I mean, maybe not as frequently, but the rate cases would still not be avoided?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you would file the base year (36:28), right? I mean \u2013 and then \u2013 but you'd have a much longer runway that you could then use to have more formulaic recovery of your capital spend and your O&M.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","How about the ROEs resetting?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's not really addressed. So, maybe that would come through if there was a change of circumstance or something like that. But I'm starting to speculate now, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. I'm sorry about it. Okay. Thank you.","Teresa S.

And then Courtenay, what's the status of Courtenay and is it going to get the PTC?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. That would be the plan, which is why we're on a tighter construction schedule, because it needs to come and service at the end of 2016. But it would be eligible for the PTC credits. And Paul, it's a great project. I mean, it's \u2013 the levelized cost of it is way below what we could basically acquire natural gas reserves for.

Welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Paul A. Johnson","Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2014 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer.","This morning, we'll review our 2014 first quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2014 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our web page. In addition, we'll post a brief video of Teresa summarizing our financial results on our web page.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Overall, it was another strong quarter for Xcel Energy. I'm pleased to report that ongoing earnings for the first quarter of 2014 were $0.52 per share, compared with $0.48 per share for the first quarter of 2013. Our solid financial results were driven by rate increases, favorable weather and higher than expected weather adjusted sales growth. This positions us well as we head into the important summer months.","Let me elaborate a bit more. The harsh winter we experienced in the upper Midwest increased earnings by almost $0.05 compared to a normal winter. Additionally, as you also know, extreme cold or heat, while improving the financial outlook, can also bring its share of operational challenges and this winter was certainly no exception. In fact, on Saturday, January 25, a rupture occurred on one of our supplier's natural gas pipelines in Canada, when temperatures were more than 20 degrees below 0 in our northern service territories. This rupture also caused 2 other pipelines to be removed from service for safety reasons, which significantly restricted the flow of natural gas into the region. Our employees worked around the clock with our suppliers and our customers to ensure that we avoided a potentially devastating natural gas outage.","The results of those proactive steps, along with the tremendous willingness of our customers to conserve, prevented what could have been a very dangerous situation. Instead, by Monday, we had resumed service back to normal. For me, it speaks volumes about our ability to respond to an operational challenge. It also reminds all of us at Xcel Energy of the need to continue to invest, plan and strive for operational excellence to provide our customers the safe and reliable energy they expect.","And besides weather, we're also seeing some potential upside for the year based on improving sales growth. And while it may a bit too early to call a trend, especially in light of the volatile weather we experienced, I am encouraged by the pickup we're beginning to see in sales, particularly in our commercial and industrial class. And Teresa will provide you more detail on this in a few minutes.","This quarter, in addition to delivering strong financial performance, we continued to pursue our environmental goals which we believe are important to our long-term success. I'm proud to announce that AWEA has named us the #1 wind provider in America for the 10th consecutive year.","Providing our customers with renewable energy at the right cost and in the most efficient manner continues to be a high priority. We support solar generation and believe there is a right way to do solar to maximize the benefit for all customers. As a result, we've undertaken several initiatives.","In Colorado, we recently proposed a new program called Solar*Connect, which will provide our customers energy options from large-scale solar projects. The program will complement rooftop solar offerings and solar gardens, and give customers alternatives for buying solar power. Our goal is to make solar energy accessible to all customers even if they don't have the ability to put photovoltaic panels on their home or business.","In Minnesota, we recently issued an RFP for up to 100 megawatts of large-scale solar generation to be installed by 2016. This RFP will help us meet the state solar mandate in a cost-effective manner. Both of these initiatives take advantage of the efficiencies of large-scale solar and provide our customers with additional renewable options. It demonstrates our commitment to have solar as a key component of our resource portfolio, and reflects our intention to see solar done the right way.","And as always, we're very focused on continuing to deliver shareholder value. In February, we increased our dividend by 7% to ensure that we provide an attractive dividend yield. The increase also reflects our flexibility as a result of our strong balance sheet, a relatively low payout ratio and the confidence we have in our business plan. Our long-term objective is to grow the dividend 4% to 6% annually.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thank you, Ben, and good morning. As Ben indicated, we are pleased to report another solid quarter with earnings of $0.52 per share, compared with 2013 first quarter earnings of $0.48 per share.","In summary, drivers of the favorable results included new and interim rates being implemented across several jurisdictions, positive weather and higher than expected weather adjusted sales. These positive factors were partially offset by higher O&M and property taxes.","Let me start by providing an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. Overall, sales growth was stronger than expected for the quarter. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 2%, and firm natural gas sales increased 3.7%.","While growth was favorable across the board, it varied by operating company. We have added a table to our earnings release that breaks down sales by utility to provide you with more detail. Beginning with SPS, weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 4%, largely driven by growth in the C&I class, although we saw strong residential growth.","The energy sector continues to provide a positive impact from oil and gas drilling activities in the Southeastern New Mexico Permian Basin area. Additional load growth in ethanol production and uranium enrichment also contributed to the higher sales.","Weather-adjusted retail sales at NSP-Wisconsin increased 3.3%. C&I sales were strong, primarily due to increased load from one of our larger customers that was operating their pipeline at reduced capacity in the first quarter of 2013, but returned to full capacity in 2014. Residential customer growth, combined with slightly increasing use per customer, drove residential sales. Additionally, propane shortages in the region likely contributed to the strong growth. As a result, we don't think this represents a sustainable growth trend.","Weather-adjusted retail electric sales at PSCo increased 1.4%, primarily driven by higher average use in the small C&I class, a new cheese factory, along with recovery at a steel mill and customer growth in the residential class.","Finally, weather-adjusted retail electric sales at NSP-Minnesota, increased 1.2%, led by C&I sales growth of 1.5% and modest residential sales improvement.","Economic conditions are generally stronger across the Xcel Energy region compared to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our service territory of 5.4% remains well below the national average of 6.8%. In addition, the number of jobs in the Xcel Energy region grew 2.2% for the quarter compared with 1.7% for the nation. As Ben mentioned, while we are encouraged to see better than expected sales, it is still too early to declare this a trend. Regardless, we have adjusted our annual sales guidance to reflect our year-to-date performance. As a result, we now anticipate electric sales growth of up to 1% for 2014.","Turning more specifically to first quarter earnings. Electric margin increased $68 million for the quarter. Key drivers included final and interim rates which increased margin by $38 million, severe cold weather increased margin by $21 million. To put this in perspective, in Minnesota, it was the 9th coldest quarter on record, and the coldest quarter since 1979. In addition, stronger than anticipated weather-adjusted sales increased margin by $12 million.","These positive impacts were partially offset by the recognition of a reserve for potential custom refund at PSCo as well as other items. The reserve for a customer refund highlights the success of the 2012 3-year rate plan we implemented in Colorado. Over the last 3 years, we have earned above our authorized return in our PSCo electric business.","The multiyear plan included an earnings test which provides for the sharing of earnings above a 10% ROE between customers and the company. As a result, both the company and customers have benefited from the multiyear plan. Clearly, this demonstrates the advantage of a multiyear plan and supports our strategy of implementing this approach in other jurisdictions.","Turning to the natural gas side of the business, margin increased by $25 million. This was largely due to rate increases, cold weather and additional revenue recovered through the pipeline integrity rider in Colorado. O&M expenses increased $31 million or 5.8%. Key drivers include nuclear costs as well as distribution and transmission expenses. It's important to point out that this deviation does not represent our planned run rate for the year.","The quarterly deviation is skewed due to the timing of O&M expenses in 2013, which were at their lowest point in the first quarter. This was primarily due to the extended outage at our Monticello nuclear plant as part of the light extension and power upgrade project, which was completed and the plant came back online in the summer of 2013. As a reminder, our nuclear outage costs are deferred during the outage and then amortized over the following 18 to 24 months. In addition, our O&M costs were at their highest level in the third and fourth quarters of 2013.","Following the positive summer weather earnings impact, we decided to increase our investment in the system in the latter part of the year, which served to increase O&M in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. As a result, we continue to expect that our 2014 O&M expenses will increase 2% to 3% consistent with our original guidance assumption.","Finally, other taxes increased about $11 million or 10%, primarily driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado.","Next, I will provide some detail on the financial results of each of our operating companies. NSP-Minnesota earnings were flat for the quarter. Colder weather and interim electric rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota, effective in January 2014, were offset by higher O&M expenses, primarily nuclear driven, and lower AFUDC. It is also important to point out that the results for the first quarter of 2013 reflect interim rates in Minnesota which were recorded at a level higher than the final rates implemented later in 2013.","PSCo's earnings were also flat for the quarter. Higher rates and sales growth were offset by increased property taxes, depreciation and accruals associated with the electric earnings test refund obligation. SPS's earnings increased $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to higher electric rates implemented mid-year 2013 and an interim rider designed to recover costs associated with transmission infrastructure in Texas, partially offset by O&M expenses.","NSP-Wisconsin earn increased -- earnings increased $0.01 per share for the quarter due to colder weather and an electric rate increase effective in January 2014, partially offset by higher O&M expense.","Next, I'll comment on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. I will begin with the recently concluded cases. As we've previously discussed, the primary objective of our regulatory strategy is to implement multiyear plans in our various jurisdictions. In North Dakota, the Commission recently approved a comprehensive 4-year settlement agreement which covers 2013 through 2016. The multiyear plan provides for annual rate increases of 4.9% for the first 3 years, and no rate increase in the final year. The plan also includes an increasing ROE from 9.75% to 10.25% during this multiyear period. In New Mexico, the Commission recently approved an overall rate increase of approximately $33 million, based on a forward test year, an ROE of 9.96% and our requested equity ratio of 53.9%. Both of these decisions represent constructive outcomes and a good start to the regulatory calendar.","Now turning to our pending cases. In Minnesota, we filed a 2-year electric rate case that covers both 2014 and 2015. Interim rates went into effect in January. At this point, it is very -- fairly early and we are still in the discovery stage of the process. The procedural schedule has been established and key dates include: intervener testimony is due in June; the ALJ report is scheduled for December; and a final decision in this case is expected in March of 2015.","The Monticello prudence review is following a similar timeline for the Minnesota rate case. We are also in the discovery phase of this proceeding. Key dates for the procedural schedule include: intervener testimony is due in July; the ALJ report is scheduled for December; and a final decision on the Monticello prudence review is expected in March of 2015. The results from the final decision will be implemented as part of the Minnesota rate case decision.","In Texas, we have requested a net increase in electric rates of $48.1 million or 5.3%. Intervener testimony is due in May and hearings are planned for June. We anticipate a final decision, with implementation of new rates in the third quarter. However, I should point out that we have been in settlement discussions with various parties and are hopeful that we can come to an agreement in the near term.","We are also preparing several filings for our other jurisdictions. In Colorado, our multiyear electric plan ends in 2014. We anticipate that the 2015 through '17 rate deficiency will be modest, with the key drivers being increased property taxes and capital costs associated with the Clean Air-Clean Jobs project. Our goal is to, again, implement a regulatory plan covering multiple years.","We have been meeting with key stakeholders to discuss various options for moving forward. In addition to a multiyear plan, we are also considering other approaches, including the implementation of riders to recover property tax and costs associated with the Clean Air-Clean Jobs project.","As we get input from our customers and other parties, we will determine the specific path that we will pursue. We also plan to file a limited reopener in Wisconsin as well as an electric rate case in South Dakota in late spring or early summer. These rate cases should be resolved by year end and will provide us with regulatory certainty in 2015.","So, turning to our financing plans, in March, PSCo issued $300 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at a very attractive coupon of 4.3%. We plan to issue the following first mortgage bonds during the first half of the year. Approximately $300 million at NSP-Minnesota; approximately $150 million at SPS; and approximately $100 million at NSP-Wisconsin.","In the first quarter we also issued approximately $78 million of equity, or 2.6 million shares, at an average price of $30.22 per share through our aftermarket, or dribble, program. This has proven to be a cost-effective method for us to issue equity.","Additionally, we continue to review our future financing plans and believe we may have the flexibility to reduce our previously forecasted equity needs over the next 5 years based on strong -- our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Further, we are analyzing the potential impact of the possible extension of bonus depreciation. We will continue to evaluate our financing plans and expect to provide an update later this year.","Finally, I want to mention that during the quarter Moody's upgraded the credit ratings of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries one notch. The outlook is stable.","This morning we are reaffirming our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. Please note, we've updated certain guidance assumptions. Details of these changes can be found in today's press release.","While we've had some positive weather and sales have been stronger than expected, we believe it is too early in the year to provide a more comprehensive update related to our 2014 earnings guidance expectations.","With that, I'll wrap up my comments. Clearly, we had another strong quarter, which is a great start to the year. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front with the constructive completion of rate cases in North Dakota and New Mexico. We are well-positioned to deliver on our 2014 earnings guidance and long-term financial objective of growing earnings and our dividends 4% to 6% annually. Finally, we are looking forward to hosting our annual meeting in Fargo, North Dakota on May 21. North Dakota is a state of growth and opportunity and we are proud to serve this fine community.","So with that, operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein","Could you talk a little bit more about Black Dog and the process for getting a PPA there? What's going wrong with it? I think what we heard on the Calpine call was that they are now saying that this process might go into late 2014, maybe early '15.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","First, let me just clarify. Black Dog is our self-build option, and Calpine, of course would be the PPA, power purchase agreement option that we referred to. And what the Commission instructed us to do is basically negotiate with all parties' top line and energy and continue to look at our own options and present them the alternatives. Timeframe is later in the year.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, we're required to respond by October. So then, it would be deliberated on after that. So that timeline is probably fairly consistent.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A question unrelated to the quarter, but just given what's happened at the Supreme Court with CASPR, kind of how should we book-end the potential impact on your capital plans?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","That's a great question, Paul. We were pretty concerned about that ruling, particularly in Texas. But a lot's happened since 2011. We've -- within SPS, we've added 700 megawatts of renewables. We've put on a more efficient gas plant in Jonesboro, we've put some abatement equipment on. And then given MATS and low gas prices across the nation, we've seen more retirements of coal plants. So the allowance market has increased significantly. So the bottom line is we don't see it as very significant to our capital plans. As a matter of fact, I mean, more to come on this. And I think it's going to be interesting to see what EPA ultimately does with this decision. But the bottom line is we think any gaps that we may have in compliance right now, we can probably meet with the purchase of allowances, which would be pretty minimal and with flow-through fuel recovery mechanisms that we have.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just any update on Boulder?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Not too much. There's been some administrative things. In April the city went -- did the first vote on forming a power and light utility. It's, I think it's part of the process they need to go through to be able to issue bonds. It's kind of part of the formal process. So we also continue to work with officials to try to craft some kind of solution that might work for both parties to avoid the municipalization, but right now that's the path we're on, and it's a long path. As we've talked about before, it's going to take more than 3 years probably to see all this through.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Glen Pruitt with Wells Fargo.","Glen F. Pruitt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question has to do with the solar programs you mentioned in your planned remarks. Over the last several years, a lot of companies have offered solar and renewable options to customers. Primarily, they were focused on just offering some percentage of your bill from solar or other renewables. I was wondering if you could give me some idea how your programs are different from those programs? Because they haven't been well received by customers in a lot of places.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I can't speak to other places, but our Windsource program has been extremely popular. And so we're trying to augment that particular program, starting in Colorado with the Solar*Connect program. It gives people that perhaps don't want to put panels on their roof or can't afford to or aren't in the right position because of their angle to the sun to have another option to have more renewable energy in their energy mix. So I think the -- I think our programs in the past have been well received. I think this program, the initial response is, well, it's generally favorable.","Teresa S. Madden","Maybe I would just add to that. The Solar*Connect program we think will be also more cost-effective than adding just solar to rooftop. It would potentially be about half the cost, in terms of having centralized solar as the resource.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, I mean, that's our whole intention. That's how we've -- look, we are a leader in renewables. I mean, 10-year running as the #1 wind provider in a the United States. Supportive of solar across all of our territories. But we're also very diligent at bringing on renewables at the right price point for all customers, and we want to continue to do that. It's extremely important that we never lose sight of what we're trying to accomplish with renewables, which in my mind is reducing carbon in an efficient manner. And we want to do that as efficiently as possible, as transparently as possible and as fairly as possible to all customers.","Glen F. Pruitt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and one follow-up question, not related. Considering some of the issues that are -- other utilities are having related to coal ash storage. Do you foresee any potential issues at your fossil plants and any possible future investment due to this new focus?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","No. Not really. Our disposals are quite a lot different than the issues you saw back on the East Coast. Clearly, we're going to watch and see if the EPA does turn around and classify coal ash as a hazard, that could drive up some expense. But the Ponnes themselves were in very good shape. As a matter of fact, EPA has given us very, very high marks for our Sherco plant, which would be the -- it's not close but it'd be the closest thing related to the some of the Ponne-ash disposal -- or Ponne-ash facilities on the East Coast.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Lauren Duke with Deutsche Bank.","Lauren B. Duke - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Colorado. You mentioned considering your options as your multiyear plan expires. And clearly, you guys are very happy with how the plan has turned out. What about the other parties to the settlement? I mean, do you get the sense that they are similarly pleased with how that worked out? Meaning, you think you could come forward with another multiyear settlement? And in the absence of a settlement, do you still feel comfortable that the Commission would be willing to approve one given what happened on the gas side?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think, by and large, the parties are happy with the multiyear plan. We -- you always have to go back and kind of review what you entered into and how it actually worked. We had some pleasant upside surprises, sales and tax things. Cost-containment that we initiated that really helped to make, I think, the multiyear plan work for all parties. I think the Commission is supportive of a multiyear plan. I also think, as Teresa mentioned, the drivers of what we need over the next several years, are really pretty specific. And it's recovery of the investments we're making under the Clean Air-Clean Jobs program. And it's recovery of property taxes. So I mean, the ask isn't going to be as big as I think parties maybe had perceived, and I think the pathway to settlement and the pathway to getting either a multiyear or a rider-type program in place, are, I think the prospects are pretty good.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Teresa Madden for closing comments.","Teresa S. Madden","Well, thanks, everyone. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22627":["Xcel Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February  2, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Benjamin G. S.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions. This morning, we will review 2016 results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release, in our filings with the SEC. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain ongoing earnings metrics that are non-GAAP measures. The comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation are included in the earnings release, which is available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I will begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, which was a great year financially, strategically and operationally. Let me start with the financial results. We had another strong year with ongoing EPS of $2.21 in 2016 compared with $2.09 per share in 2015. This represents an ongoing EPS growth rate of 5.7%, which is at the upper end of our 4% to 6% growth objective. This was our 12th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We also raised our dividend by 6.3% to $1.36 per share in 2016. This was the 13th straight year we've increased our dividend.","Turning to strategy, in 2016, we introduced our steel-for-fuel strategy. Because of the strong wind resources in our service territories, we have a unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs can be offset by fuel savings. As a result, we are planning to invest about $3.5 billion in renewables over the next five years. So, let me give you a quick update on some of our major initiatives. The Colorado 600 megawatt Rush Creek wind project was approved by the Commission last year and is progressing as planned. Rush Creek is expected to go in service in 2018.","In Minnesota, we are seeking to add 1,500 megawatts of new wind generation, which reflects an RFP for PPAs or Build-Own-Transfer projects, and our own self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation. As part of the RPF process, we received proposals from 17 bidders with 95 proposals for almost 10,000 megawatts of wind generation, featuring a combination of PPAs and Build-Own-Transfer projects. We've analyzed the bids, developed a shortlist and are negotiating with the developers. We believe our 750 megawatt self-build wind proposal is competitive and will complement the RFP portfolio. We plan to follow recommendation with the Minnesota Commission later in the first quarter, and we expect a decision in the summer.","We also continue to make progress on the $1.5 billion of undefined renewable projects, which are included in our capital forecast. We're working with various stakeholders and are in advanced discussions with site developers about adding 500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts of wind generation at SPS. And we expect to share further details later in the year.","Finally, last year, we entered into a wind turbine supply agreement with Vestas, which provides us the flexibility to develop up to 2,500 megawatts of wind generation. This agreement allows us to secure 100% of the PTC benefit and maximize the fuel savings for our customers. It's all part of our steel-for-fuel strategy. We have strong wind resources with high capacity factors in our service territories. We have support for the development of renewable projects from state policymakers, interested stakeholders and our customers. And we've taken timely actions to secure the full utilization of the wind Production Tax Credits. As a result, we expect the fuel savings on wind projects will more than offset the capital cost and that's what steel-for-fuel's all about.","We also had a strong year in operations. In 2016, we successfully completed the construction of a 200-megawatt Courtney Wind Farm in North Dakota, and we did it on time and under budget. This was our first wind project in which we were the general contractor and is further evidence of our ability to develop, manage and construct wind projects. While the project took 15 months to complete, you can watch the entire construction process in a three-minute time-lapse video posted on our website. I think it's a fascinating video and I encourage you to check it out.","We had an excellent operational and safety year in 2016 and I want to take a moment to thank all of the Xcel employees who work hard throughout the year and always put safety and customers first. We had several challenging storms in our service territories recently and we responded with industry-leading efficiency. One example was the wave of intense storms that hit our service territories over the Christmas weekend, resulting in more than 100,000 customer outages. Our crews braved frigid temperatures and unusually icy conditions to restore power safely and quickly so that our customers could enjoy the holidays. And just recently, ice storm Jupiter ripped through Texas, impacting 58,000 customers, many of them in small towns and remote locations. Once again, our field crews and supporting teams worked around the clock to restore power to our customers in a timely fashion.","Finally, Minnesota legislators recently introduced a bill which would allow us to build a natural gas combined-cycle power plant at our Sherco site. We originally proposed this plan, along with the addition of renewables, as part of our Resource Plan, which enables the early retirement of two coal units at the Sherco site. The Minnesota Commission acknowledged the capacity need and the benefits of siting new generation at the existing plant site, but elected to defer a decision to a later date, which would require us to file a Certificate of Need.","The bill was driven by legislators who are concerned about the loss of jobs and tax revenue and wanted to expedite the decision process. It's important to note we have provided extensive justification for the plant, and the Commission will still need to approve cost recovery for the power plant. The bill has passed the Energy Committee in the House, but will require approval in both the full House and Senate, along with approval of the Governor. We expect to get final resolution later in the year. If the bill is not passed, then we would plan to file a Certificate of Need. Please note, this facility is not included in our capital forecast, and any potential capital investment would likely occur after 2021.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and he will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, as well as a regulatory update.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Ben, and good morning. My comments today will focus predominantly on full-year 2016 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release that was distributed this morning and posted on our website.","As Ben indicated, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance and delivered 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.21 per share compared with $2.09 per share of ongoing earnings in 2015. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.36 per share, largely due to rate increases and non-fuel riders to recover our capital investments; and a lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to wind Production Tax Credits in 2016, which flow back to our customers.","Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings by $0.21 per share, and higher interest expenses and property taxes, which combined reduced earnings by $0.08 per share.","Another key driver to our EPS outcome was our disciplined approach to O&M expenses. For the third year in a row, Xcel Energy has maintained no growth in operating and maintenance expenses. While we're proud of our discipline, we remain committed to actively managing our cost for the benefits of our customers. Our objective is to continue our trend of no growth in O&M, which we expect to achieve through a continued focus on operational and commercial excellence as well as productivity improvements through the use of technology. Based on our track record, you should be confident in our ability to achieve this objective.","Turning to sales, as we've discussed each quarter, we've seen a slight slowdown in both gas and electric sales in 2016. On a weather- and leap-year-adjusted basis, we experienced a full year electric sales decline of 0.3% for 2016. Our positive residential sales growth was offset by lower C&I sales in most jurisdictions. Natural gas sales declined 1% in 2016 on a weather- and leap-year-adjusted basis.","We continue to see positive customer growth in our service territories for both the electric and natural gas businesses, but that growth has been offset by lower use per customer, primarily driven by improvements in energy efficiency.","2016 was a very productive year in terms of regulatory proceedings, and let me touch on a few of the highlights. We reached a four-year settlement in our Minnesota rate case, which is pending Commission approval. We reached constructive outcomes in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas rate cases. The Minnesota Commission approved our Resource Plan, which will result in significant carbon reductions due to the early retirement of two coal units and the addition of wind and solar generation. We filed requests with the Colorado Commission for approval of partial decoupling mechanism and for a Certificate of Need for the Advanced Grid initiative. We expect decisions on both initiatives later in the second quarter.","Let me provide some detail on our Texas rate case, which was approved by the Commission last week. We settled the case earlier in the year, and the key terms include a base rate increase of $35.2 million, power factor revenue of $12.6 million, and recovery of $4 million of rate case expenses in a separate proceeding. We believe the outcomes in both Texas and New Mexico rate cases reflect an improving regulatory environment in SPS.","Next, I want to spend just a moment on tax reform. It certainly has been topical for the industry and is a key component of the pro-growth agenda of the new Congress and administration. We believe we are in early innings of this process. And given the complicated nature of comprehensive tax reform, we believe we have several quarters until we get additional clarity on likely outcomes. And while we believe things will continue to evolve, we have analyzed two potential tax reform scenarios and their potential impact on Xcel Energy.","The first scenario is essentially the executive branch plan, which reflects a 20% corporate tax rate, maintains interest deductibility and does not include 100% bonus depreciation. Under this scenario, the impact will be mildly accretive to our earnings in 2021 due to a reduction in the deferred tax liability over time.","The second scenario is essentially the House blueprint, which reflects a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% bonus depreciation. Under this scenario, the impact would be modestly dilutive to our earnings in 2021 due to the loss of interest deductibility and lower rate base.","Longer term, we believe that the industry is permanently negatively impacted by the loss of interest deductibility. Accordingly, Xcel Energy will continue to work vigorously with EEI to advance the interests of our customers and our industry. Finally, we remain confident we can manage the potential impact of tax reform and deliver on our EPS and dividend growth objectives.","With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2016 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 13th straight year. We held O&M flat for the third consecutive year. We reached a settlement in the Minnesota Multiyear Rate Plan and resolved regulatory proceedings in Texas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.","The Minnesota Commission approved our Resource Plan, which set the framework for the addition of renewable projects and the retirement of two coal facilities. This should result in 63% of the NSP System energy being carbon-free by 2030. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy and we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. First question, can you remind us embedded in your 2017 guidance what is the assumed earned ROE at the utility level compared to what you actually earned in 2016?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, Ali, as you know, we've been \u2013 our ROEs in 2016, we didn't make a lot of progress over where we were in 2015, and that's primarily due to lower authorized ROEs. So, when I look at 2017 and when I look at 2018, we will continue to, I think, close that gap, albeit on a lower authorized ROE. We'll primarily do that through entering into multiyear plans. We expect approval in Minnesota of our multiyear plan and we expect we'll have another multiyear plan in Colorado. We'll combine that with our cost initiatives, and I think where that'll put us in 2018 is probably in the low 9s as far as blended utility ROEs. And so, we'll make steady progress towards that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And Ben, to your point, when we factor in the lower authorized ROE, assuming the Minnesota settlement is approved, when you factor that in, what is now the sort of regulatory lag when you run the math based on that new ROE at Minnesota?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, the lag is \u2013 you've cut into the lag significantly under the multiyear plans. It's just that it's at a lower base rate of 9.2%. So, I don't have the exact number. But I think we've probably got, what, about...","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I mean, Ali, another way to look at it, we're \u2013 if you look at 2016, we earned a little over 9.2% in Minnesota, so we're earning our authorized. The blended authorized ROE for the NSP \u2013 for the Xcel system is about 9.6% and currently we're earning about 9%. So, previously, the gap was about 90 basis points. Now, it's about 60 basis points.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And bulk of (17:39) that 9.6%, that factors in the 9.2% at \u2013 the new ROE at Minnesota?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And my last question, coming back to the normalized electric sales trends, anything to read into the Q4 numbers turning negative? And does that influence at all? I think you've assumed flat to like 0.5% as kind of your growth numbers for 2017. You're still looking \u2013 that still looks good, or any changes given what you're seeing ending last year?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think the quarter is indicative of where we think trends will go. We are seeing good customer growth, Ali, in Colorado and Minnesota and other jurisdictions. That growth we are typically going to keep under the decoupling mechanisms either in place or proposed. You put it all together, though, and we think the long-term trend's that zero to 0.5% growth.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Well done.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Julien. Thanks.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, I wanted to just ask a quick follow-up on this legislative angle real quickly. You kind of describe a timeline issue and a reason to be expeditious to pursue this via legislation instead of a traditional route, you talk about. What is that difference in timing as you perceive it right now, net-net? And also, just to be clear, you talk about it as being beyond the current Resource Plan, what's the timing if you get the legislation done versus not as well, just in terms of in-service and where that \u2013 just how far out that is?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. I don't know if I heard the first part of your question, Julien. So, could you repeat that again?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry. I apologize for the signal (19:41). I was really asking about what is the timeline difference between pursuing the legislative approach versus the traditional Certificate of Need approach in Minnesota?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, if we get the legislation that could happen fairly quickly. It is, we do \u2013 our latest update says it's progressing very fast and it could be to the Governor by the end of this month. A Certificate of Need we would be filing later in the year. And we've got Chris Clark, who's the President of NSP, when would that get done most likely, Chris?","Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Typically, the Certificate of Needs take about 18 months. They can take as long as two years to proceed through that. So, the legislation would eliminate the need for some of that proceeding, Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And so, Julien, that's why the legislation is being proposed because the constituents at Becker, where the Sherco site is located, are worried about tax base loss, and they want to preserve as many jobs as possible. And as an aside, we've been working very closely with those stakeholders and driving other forms of economic development to the region as well. So, our plan has always been about pragmatic decarbonization. But we're also very respectful and understanding of the communities that are impacted and trying to minimize that impact. And our proposal to the Commission did just that. And again, I think our legislators like to just move it along a little quicker. As your last part of your question...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","The expenditures, and I think that would be roughly $800 million. That would occur post-2021 and would be consistent with the shutdown of the units, which I think take place in 2023?","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","2026.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes. Okay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. So, it would be in service around 2026 either way?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes. That's today's plan.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then a bigger picture question. Just if you can remind us, perhaps tailing off of Ali's question as well, where do you stand within your growth rate, as far as your execution on the earned ROE improvement? And how do you improve it from here? Should we be looking for more capital, more fuel-for-steel element to drive you to the upper end, or are we talking about the earned ROE improvement to be the principal driver at this point as well?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think it's a combination. Our rate base growth is in the upper 5%. So, I mean, we're clearly focused on executing on what we have embedded in our capital plans. That would be the proposal here in Minnesota. It would be developing specific projects, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to cover that $1.5 billion of renewables in our CapEx program. So, if you execute on that, you execute on the \u2013 getting the settlement on the multiyear plan in Minnesota, you get another multiyear plan in Colorado. Then our cost initiatives should improve the ROE, as I mentioned. And you put all that together, and I think it would bode pretty well for our EPS growth rate over the next five years.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. So, upper end, clearly?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, there's a lot of execution that goes with that. But that would certainly be what we'd be shooting for.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Great, guys. Thank you very much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just focusing on the 2017 guidance factors that you provide, it seemed like a number of them have gone in the wrong direction versus the EEI update, and probably add up to best part of a nickel negative. Are there some other things you don't call out that are going to go \u2013 are going to offset some of that pressure, pension maybe, or are those \u2013 is that direction correct within the range for this year?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I'll let Bob give you some details, Jonathan. But I mean, I think most of those are just truing up for where we landed in 2016. That said, we did have a holdco debt issuance at the end of the year. So we will pick up a little interest expense associated with that. But we believe it's very manageable. And I can just tell you that our outlook on our ability to land guidance really remains unchanged. So, Bob, I don't know if you want to add any color to that?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No. I mean, Ben \u2013 Jon, I think that Ben said it all. We true up, as we do with every guidance assumption, and we have ranges. We think that with respect to some of the capital accounts, the depreciation and the rider revenues ,that we can manage within those ranges. And then, as Ben said, the interest expense was both a mark-to-market on what we see in the market since EEI, as well as the holdco bond that we did back in December. So we think it's all manageable. It's a couple of pennies. And I think we can manage through that this year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just on the Minnesota wind, Ben, I think you used the word, you're confident that your self-build proposal would complement the RFP.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I just want to make sure I remember the numbers correctly. You're looking for 1,000 megawatts overall, is that correct? Of which you've submitted a 750 megawatts self-build?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No. I think, based upon the robustness of the bidding, I think we're looking at 1,500 megawatts. We have a 750-megawatt self-build proposal, as you know. Our pricing is very competitive with that, and we've also seen competitive PPAs and competitive Build-Own-Transfer. So, it leads me to believe that, at the end of the day, we'll have ownership opportunities for 750 megawatts, potentially some upside there, but at this point, that's what our assumption is.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, you're feeling good that your 750 megawatts will be part of the overall package, basically?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I got a cold, but I'm feeling good about the RFP process.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Well, thank you for that, and I hope you feel better.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wondering, given that we're now probably not going to see any kind of carbon legislation or cuts, et cetera, at the federal level, how do you think that impacts what Minnesota regulators, even politicians, might be thinking is necessary at the state level as you go through another round of Resource Plan?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for that question, Travis, because I think it's a really important thing to talk about. I actually think that it strengthens our Resource Plans and what we're trying to accomplish, because we've always been about approaching carbon reduction from a pragmatic standpoint. I mean, steel-for-fuel is a great example of that; never losing sight of customer affordability, never losing sight of reliability, not being really interested in running massive science experiments. And so, there have been times, despite our environmental leadership, where we've been critical of some public policies and other things, which we didn't think it was the most pragmatic, efficient way to get things done.","So, I now think there's more opportunity to rally around our plans, which have always been pragmatic. And that's in Minnesota, that's in Colorado. And I think you continue to advance the ball there, because it just makes economic sense. And by the way, the economic sense is what we'd be reporting to you later in the year about what's taking place in SPS where that would be driven by economics. So, it's a little counterintuitive, but I actually think it makes what we've been proposing that much more appealing.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. And then just remind me what the timing cycle is for the IRP process going forward.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","In what state?","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Resource Plan.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","In Minnesota?","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Minnesota, yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You want to take that, Chris?","Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Ben. We'll file for the approval of the wind projects that are selected in the first quarter. And then, to the extent that we have additional filings for the next Resource Plan, the Commission has asked for that in 2019. So the immediate focus is going to be in advancing those wind proposals this year.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And then you would make a full Resource Plan filing in 2018-2019 timeframe?","Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Correct.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Is that right? Okay. So kind of every two to three years.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Correct.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to just go through tax reform. I think you gave a good high level overview. In the scenario in which CapEx is immediately expensed, could you talk about sort of what you might want to do in terms of increasing your rate base growth, if anything, or if that's really in your mind, not necessarily in the grand scheme, to keep along the earnings trajectory that you'd like to hit?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, that's a good question, Stephen. I do think we have to be careful that we don't try to give model specific, quantifiable, this is what we'll do and blah, blah, blah, because post 2021, I mean, I think you're going to have so many variables that \u2013 first of all, I think, as Bob said, we're in the early innings. And disruption with border tax adjustments, I mean, it just leads me to believe that if tax reform happens, we'll be talking \u2013 and we're talking about it this time next year, it will be a lot different than what we're talking about now.","That said, yeah, I mean, it does create headroom, and that's a good thing. And we certainly have a lot of investment potential to invest in a grid. We have some grid investment initiatives. But you know that our approach has always been to make sure that we don't invest so much that it starts to make our prices rise more than an acceptable level. So, we've always throttled that back. And that's one of the reasons why we concentrate on steel-for-fuel, because it doesn't raise prices. If you create the headroom, then you can push the throttle down on CapEx, specifically as it relates to the grid.","I will say, though, and Bob mentioned it in his remarks, that I am working with EEI and my colleague CEOs to convince federal legislators that our industry \u2013 while everybody thinks it's unique, we truly are unique, and I don't think the long-term trade of receiving bonus depreciation in exchange for non-deductibility of interest, which is a permanent difference when you get to the regulatory rate-making arena, is a good trade for customers or shareholders. Obviously, industry and Xcel would adapt. And I'm optimistic that we'd get the right kind of tax reform and the economy will grow and we'll all benefit from that. But I do think we need to be careful to try to give exact quantifications long term. I'd rather just talk about the trends that we see and what we like to see differently.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes perfect sense. I think it's just good to hear you talk about the ability to be able to throttle as needed. So, that makes sense. And my follow-up just is on the wind at SPS. You mentioned in your remarks the ability to potentially pursue 500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts. Could you just talk a little bit more about the regulatory process for getting that approved? I wasn't completely clear on how that would unfold.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, we would make the proposal, I think, in the spring. Is that right, Marvin? In the spring of this year. The Commission would then take up to 12 months to actually approve it. And we've calculated that all into our construction schedules, et cetera. So, it all would be put together in time to enjoy the 100% value of the Production Tax Credits.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. So, this would be self-build. This wouldn't be a mirror image of the Minnesota approach. This would be a bit of a different approach here?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No, there isn't a formalized RFP process at SPS. So, we are working with site developers and, as I mentioned, we're in late-stage discussions on how that would all work. But this would be our ownership.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Bob, I was hoping you can give us more detail on your tax comments, particularly on the administration's proposal. You said that it would be mildly accretive and that that would be primarily due to deferred tax liability, I guess, cash benefits over time for you. Could you give us kind of more detail there? Explain if that's all on the kind of corporate level of the company, and if that is basically just offsetting the increased drag from the lower tax rate itself.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, I think when you take the deferred tax liability position that the company sits in today, and if you assume, just call it, an effective 40% tax rate and you cut it in half, you change that deferred tax liability. And over time, that changes your rate base as you flow those benefits back to \u2013 the cash back to the customers. And secondarily, and probably more importantly, as we continue to spend capital in that program, the deferred tax liability associated with regular maker schedules would set up on your balance sheet at a slightly different level. And so, your rate base would be slightly higher than it otherwise would be at a 40% tax rate.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, it's all on the regulated side that you're kind of making that detailed assumption. Got it.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's correct.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, there's been kind of pretty material changes at the Colorado Commission over the past month or so. Does that, I don't know, change your filing strategy at all for this year? How can we think about kind of timing and expectations there for both the electric and the gas side?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","This is Ben. It doesn't change that strategy. We know Jeff Ackermann very well, and I think he's going to be a great Chair. Wendy Moser, she definitely knows the business. So, I think we're quite optimistic about what the new Commission looks like. We also had some changes in Minnesota, and I think those changes are going to be productive and constructive. And we look forward to working with the Minnesota Commission as well. So, I think they're positives.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what can we expect in terms of the timing of the filings in Colorado? And then kind of the duration of the ask (37:19) there, is that going to be a multiyear for electric and then another single year for gas?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, the timing is, we'll file in the spring of this year, and we will be asking for a multiyear on the electric side. Marvin, what are we going to be asking on the gas side?","Marvin E. McDaniel Jr. - Xcel Energy, Inc.","We're still looking through on the gas side. It will come later on this year, probably around summer. Spring to summer of 2017.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I mean I think \u2013 I don't know if we'll get multiyear or not. I think that depends on the negotiations. We do think that these cases are set up to settle. And so, that will be the primary driver. We would also like to see the gas rates in effect before the winter heating season.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. A quick question. When do you expect to make your next Texas Transmission Cost Recovery Factor filing?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Okay. You got me stumped on that one. Anybody around the room? Marvin, you got it?","Marvin E. McDaniel Jr. - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Pardon me. I'll double check the number. I think it's in this \u2013 it's right now, frankly.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Anthony, this is Bob. I think that, after concluding our Texas rate case that was approved by the Commission, we had negotiated the ability to file the TCRF filing immediately. And you should expect to see that from us sometime this month.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just quickly, I know your strategy is unique with the steel-for-fuel and you created headroom, but have you been seeing any pushback on rate increases in any of your jurisdictions? We're seeing possibly some pushback in California, and just want to know, in your jurisdiction, have you seen anything?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I would say, we're not seeing it now, but we certainly have saw in past years. And that's why we kind of had some of the issues we had a few years ago, as we pushed through a significant amount of capital, particularly associated with the relicensing of our nuclear plants. The bottom line is, I think it's very difficult to justify more than a 2% to 3% increase in rates. That's why we've been very cautious as we \u2013 you heard in my remarks before, we have a lot of money we can spend in the grid, and we'll go as fast as our customers and our regulators want us to go. And typically, that means a kind of an inflationary-type pace of rate increases. This is why we're so excited about steel-for-fuel, because it pays for itself. But I absolutely \u2013 but we're very mindful of that, and our capital plans respect that.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hey. Good morning. How are you?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Just a couple questions. First, just on the SPS on the wind. Is that part of the $1.5 billion that you had in the handout?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes. It would start to give details around that $1.5 billion. Correct.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Got it. Okay. And then just in general, the upside CapEx that you had outlined, I guess it was on the third quarter call, when you gave guidance and all that, where are we at there, as far as like the percent that has gotten down (41:03)...?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Are you talking about the \u2013 the upside I think that you're referring to would the $1.5 billion of renewables that we didn't have specifically identified projects for, Andy. Is that what you're talking about?","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","No, I think it's a total, like through 2020, I think it is, that you have like \u2013 you have your base case and then you have your upside CapEx, as you fill in over time (41:29)...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","The only thing that we weren't \u2013 that we had to \u2013 we were confident in, that's why it was in the forecast, but that we had to actually solutionize, if you will, was the $1.5 billion. Everything else is pretty much identified.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Andy, it's Bob. The construct you're talking about was something we were talking about through most of 2016. When we gave new capital guidance at EE,I or on the third quarter earnings call, we rolled all the sort of upside capital from that into, what I call our base capital plan, and that's reflective of the $18.2 billion capital plan that we now talk about. So, it's all in there.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Which gets you to the high end of your growth rate, basically...?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's correct. I think our rate base growth rate has us 5.5% rate base growth rate over the next five years.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And then, kind of a question that I have always been asking, and if you kind of look at where the numbers are all falling out, as you said, you've filled in most of the CapEx, as far as to get to the high end of your rate base growth. I think on the cost-control side, you're probably in the early innings of being able to continue to do a good job there, whether it's reduce costs or keep costs flat; get the Minnesota rate case, which is already settled, approved, hopefully, by the end of the second quarter; and then the 750-megawatts for the Upper Midwest, probably the same timeframe. Once you get all that done and you feel more comfortable about getting those big pieces in line, is that a good time to address the growth rate of 4% to 6% and refresh it going forward?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, Andy, every time we have significant changes, either to the upside or the downside, we're always going to take a look at what that means for our long-term growth rate and update accordingly. And so, as you get more time and more certainty, and certainly what you're talking about, it would be execution, as I mentioned, and we'll take a look at it. And we'll take a look at if there's any tailwinds that \u2013 or headwinds, rather, that might have surfaced as well. So, look for us to \u2013 we continue to review that long-term growth rate. And if it needs to change, we'll change it.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And I guess the right time would kind of be after you kind of get these final pieces in place. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean I'm not going to get specific on the timeframe. We just continue to look at what's happened and what we think will happen in the future.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. I appreciate that. I mean it's just interesting as we go through earnings the last couple of days, it seems, in your case, your growth rate is at least trending towards the high end, if not going higher than the high end, and you'd kind of work out the numbers that's probably higher than the high end. But we'll give you time to...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I appreciate that, Andy, because you're right, it is. And again, I think, as I've said before, our rate base growth is going to increase. But when you have things like steel-for-fuel and the pace of rate increases is modest. And that's really important we think to long-term success. And that's...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","And I think that your cost control is helping that as well...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","...similar to CMS. And then if you kind of look at what we've been dealing with the last couple of days, most companies are taking down their growth rates while you have the potential of raising it. So, hopefully, over time, that will get reflected in your...","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You're trailing away, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that over the last couple of days, there have been a number of companies that have been taking down their growth rate, or trending towards the bottom of their growth rate, while yours seem to be trending towards the top of your growth rate and, potentially, the ability to raise that growth rate. So, hopefully, over time, that will be reflected in your stock as far as a relative PE to the...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","It sounds like you like our story, Andy. We appreciate that. We'll keep working on it for you, promise.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","We do, but thank you very much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you doing?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just you made some comments just now about the efforts by you and other utilities to get some form of different treatment vis-\u00e0-vis others regarding tax reform. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more of a flavor as to how far along that process is. Have you been with the administration or anything, or what kind of feedback you got?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, this is Ben. Yeah, we've been working closely with, like I mentioned, other CEOs in the industry with EEI, the trade group, as you know. And so, yeah, we've had some preliminary discussions, but I would emphasize the word preliminary. I mean, this is \u2013 I think there's a long way to go with tax reform. I really do. And again, I think when we're talking about tax reform a year from now, we'll be talking about something that looks, I believe, a lot different than what's on the table now. I mean, it's just \u2013 our industry is impacted. We think there is a way to address that. We think normalization might be that pathway. But when I think of other industries, the retail industry, et cetera, there is major potential disruption. So, I'm not \u2013 I really think we'll have \u2013 I'm optimistic about tax reform, but I think it will probably look a lot different than what we're talking about today. And I do think the Senate is going to weigh in, and we've heard that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","In what way? What do you mean the Senate's going to weigh in?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I don't think \u2013 if you read the commentary from the key members of the Senate, I think they're saying that they appreciate what the House has done, but they're going to have their own version of what tax reform should look like.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I'm sorry. And do you have any sense as to when we're going to get \u2013 I mean, I appreciate what you're saying in terms of the disruption and just the wide variation as to what could happen. Do you have any idea when we'd get like a little bit more of a sense as to when we'll get a better idea as to sort of a narrowing of what actually is going to be put on the table? I know it's early. I'm just wondering.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I mean, it's early. I think you'll see it \u2013 you'll see the House version get passed. Then the Senate will take up what I believe will be their own version, which, my personal opinion, and based upon conversations we've had, will look a lot different than the House version. We haven't even talked about transition rules. And I think there'll definitely be transition rules because of the potential disruptive nature.","So, I think Bob said in his remarks, give us a couple more quarters and let's see how things go. Things are moving fast in this administration. But I really do think this to get done, unless you try to jam it through in a budget reconciliation process, and even then I think you'd be hard-pressed to get a majority of senators voting on that. I do think this is going to take some bipartisan work. And I certainly hope it is a bipartisan product, because I think that's better for the country, in my personal opinion.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.

With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer.","This morning we\u2019ll provide you with an update on recent business development, discuss first quarter results, review our 2012 earnings guidance, highlight our strong corporate governance and take your questions.","As a reminder, there are slides that accompany today\u2019s call which are available on our web page. In addition some of the comments we make will contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Thank you, and good morning. Today we\u2019ve reported first quarter earnings of $0.38 per share compared with $0.42 per share in 2011. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that weather was significantly warmer this quarter, and that had an adverse impact on our results.","However, we\u2019ve initiated actions to help offset the impact of warmer weather and lower than forecasted at electric sale. As a result of our efforts, quarterly O&M expenses came in roughly flat with last year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect 2012 earnings to be in the lower half of our earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share.","Now Teresa will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance in greater detail in a few moments. I\u2019ll now provide you with few updates, beginning with the review of our regulatory development.","In Minnesota, we are pleased that the Commission approved our rate case settlement at the end of March. The annual rate increases of $58 million in 2011; $15 million in 2012 are based on 10.37 ROE. This settlement also includes a $30 million reduction through depreciation expense. As part of the settlement in the Minnesota Electric case, the settling parties recognized that NSP Minnesota would follow up the decision sticking deferred accounting for 2012 property tax expense above the level approved in a rate case.","In December, we filed the petition requesting a deferral of incremental 2012 property taxes, which are currently estimated at $24 million. In April, the Department of Commerce recommended that the commission denied the request. However, a coalition of large industrial customers and the Chamber Of Commerce were supportive of our deferred accounting request.","Our earnings guidance reflects the assumption that we are able to defer incremental property taxes in Minnesota. We believe we\u2019ve met their criteria for deferred accounting treatment. Last week, we filed our response to the department\u2019s concern, which provide strong support for our request. We expect the Minnesota PUC to rule on this request during the second quarter.","In Colorado, we arrived at a comprehensive multi-year rate settlement agreement with the PUC staff, the office of consumer counsel and several other intervenors. The agreement reflects a 73 million electric rate increase in 2012; an incremental $16 million increase in 2013; and a $25 million increase in 2014, based on a 10% ROE and a 56% equity ratio.","In addition, the settlement enables us to defer incremental property taxes. We believe this is a constructive settlement that provides revenue and regulatory certainty for both our customers and our shareholders, while establishing a regulatory framework for a multi-year plan. Hearings were held on Tuesday, and the commission is deliberating on the settlement this morning, and may rule later today.","Turning our focus to 2013; in June we plan to file an electric and natural gas case in Wisconsin. During the second half of the year, we plan to file several cases, including electric cases in Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota. Finally, we plan to file an electric case in Minnesota, where we are anticipating pursuing a multi-year plan.","Together these cases will drive earnings in 2013. One final regulatory item. In March, we asked the Minnesota Commission to reaffirm that increasing generating capacity at our Prairie Island nuclear plant within our customer\u2019s best interest. We are seeking a reaffirmation as much as change since the Commission issued a certificate of need for the Prairie Island operate in 2009. Key changes since 2009 include a more lengthy approval process at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, less expected incremental output from the plant to operate, higher project costs, lower natural gas prices, as well as lower demand growth.","When circumstances change significantly after an initial regulatory approval as with this project, our approach is to step back and take another look before continuing. It\u2019s prudent to have this review now rather than after completing the project. This is consistent with our focus on stake holder alignment. We anticipate the Minnesota PUC will rule on this request later this year or early next.","We also continue to make good progress implementing our transmission strategy. Notably, the Minnesota Commission granted the last siting and routing permit needed for the CapX2020 lines in Minnesota. The right of first refusal bill was signed into law in Minnesota. We began phase II of the Fargo-St. Cloud line and the construction of the Brookings Hampton line and in Texas we reached a settlement for the route of the Tuco-Woodward line. Clearly, our transmission projects remain on track.","Next, I\u2019d like to provide you a brief environmental update. During the last year, EPA continue to pursue its regulatory agenda, which significantly raises the bar for environmental compliance. In most cases, our proactive environmental strategy has dramatically reduced our cost of compliance with EPA\u2019s new mandate.","For example, in late 2011, EPA finalized its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule. But we\u2019ll have to make some emission control investments under this rule; our cost of compliant is lower than the rest of the industry, primarily because of the actions we implemented over the last decade.","EPA also proposed to approve, our regional haze plan for Colorado this year. That plan incorporates our Clean Air Clean Jobs emission reduction program, a plan which mitigates the cost of EPA regulations for our customers. As a result of our proactive environmental action, Xcel Energy is well positioned to meet various environmental challenges over the next decade. We believe our customers and shareholders had benefited from these actions.","The biggest environmental challenge we\u2019re currently facing is EPA\u2019s CSAPR rule. Because of its short compliance window, CSAPR was unusual and that it had a significant impact on Xcel Energy and our customer. As a result, we joined other utilities in several states in challenging the rule and seeking its stay.","Late last year, the Court of Appeal stayed the rule, while it continue to consider the merits of our challenge. Last month the court listened to arguments over the legality of the rule. We expect the ruling sometime this summer and remain optimistic that this litigation will result in better environmental regulation. Clearly, public policy will continue to impact our capital spend.","Our five-year capital forecast includes approximately $470 million for CSAPR compliance; and $300 million for the Prairie Island upgrade. The changes in timing or compliance with CSAPR as well as the Minnesota Commission\u2019s decision on the upgrade to Prairie Island could potentially reduce our capital forecast. If these projects are modified or canceled, we still project strong rate-based growth over the next five years. In addition, a reduction in our capital forecast would reduce our financing requirement, and provide us with increased flexibility.","One final comment before I turn the call over to Teresa. The continued low price of natural gas is a hot topic for our industry. With deal closes or recovery mechanisms in all of our states, low natural gas prices are very beneficial for our customer and for Xcel Energy. This is especially true as we investments to modernize our systems. Our customers see lower bills, and a lower share of their income is spent on energy consumption.","While we make investments in our system to provide our customers with long term value, our mission is to provide our customer with clean, safe, reliable energy at a competitive price. Lower fuel prices certainly help us achieve that mission.","Tune it over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today I will discuss first quarter results, 2012 earnings guidance and a shareholder proposal included in this year\u2019s proxy. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing our first quarter results at each of our four operating companies.","As Ben indicated, warm weather throughout our service territory negatively impacted our first quarter results, mostly notably in Minnesota, which experienced the warmest March in over 100 year.","For the quarter, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.01 per share due to lower sales as result of the warmer weather, decreased wholesale revenue due to the expiration of the Black Hills contract, higher depreciation and interest expense partially offset by higher gas revenues, resulting from new rates that were effective in September 2011.","At NSP Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.03 per share due to weather, final rates which were lower than interim rates last year, higher property taxes and higher O&M expenses. These negative drivers were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, which I\u2019ll discuss in a few moments.","Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin and SPS were both flat for the quarter. Quarterly results at both companies were positively impacted by new rates effective in January 2012, offset primarily by the negative impact of weather.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the drivers that affected various line items in the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Our first quarter electric margin decreased by $25 million, primary drivers of the reduced margins were $22 million from the estimated impact of weather and $11 million from lower firm wholesale revenue largely driven by the expiration of the Black Hills contract. These negative items were partially offset by higher transmission revenue, retail rate increases in several states and other smaller items.","Weather normalized retail electric sales grew 0.3%, and had a negligible impact on electric margin. However, this modest increase included the benefit of an extra day of sales due to leap year, without the extra day the first quarter electric sales declined eight tenths of 1%. We might recall that our fourth quarter sales were also slightly negative. This is a disappointing trend, and as a result, we now expect our weather adjusted annual sales growth to be flat for 2010.","Natural gas margins decreased by $19 million in the first quarter, primarily due to warm winter weather which reduced margins by $21 million.","Turning to expenses, first quarter O&M expenses were essentially flat for the quarter. In January, we began a comprehensive review of our O&M expenses with a goal of not compromising reliability or customer service. We were able to implement several initiatives such as deferring merit increases for non-bargaining employees, reducing incentive company accrual, corresponding new hires, cutting training and other items to offset the impact of lower than forecasted sales and warm weather.","As a result of these actions, we now expect O&M expenses to increase between 0% and 1% for the year. Previously, our guidance reflected an annual O&M increase of 3% to 4%. Other taxes increased approximately $9.1 million or 9.4% largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. As Ben discussed, we\u2019ve requested deferral of incremental property taxes in Minnesota for 2012. However, we\u2019ll continue to expense the incremental property taxes until the Minnesota Commission rules on this issue. If our request is approved, we would retroactively defer these incremental property taxes for the beginning of the year.","You may have noticed, we have an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. We expect this tax rate was primarily due to the recent completion of a tax planning analysis regarding the eligibility of certain expenses that qualify for an extended carry back. As a result of the differential between a higher tax rate in prior years and the current tax rate, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the first quarter. As a result of this tax benefit, we\u2019ve adjusted our projected effective tax rate for 2012 to a range of 34% to 35%. This has been a challenging year for us, very warm winter weather and declining normalized sale.","However, we\u2019ve taken steps to at least partially offset these impacts by managing O&M expenses and implementing a tax planning strategy. Clearly, we still have a lot of work to do. With our management action, normal weather the rest of the year and assumed constructed outcomes in our regulatory proceedings, including commission approval of our settlement agreement in Colorado, and our deferred property tax request in Minnesota, we continue to expect to deliver earnings in the lower half our guidance range, of $1.75 to $1.85 per share.","Before we open up the call for your questions, I\u2019d like to draw your attention briefly to this year\u2019s proxy statement, which includes the shareholder proposal for Xcel Energy to adopt the policy or the Chairman of the company would be an Independent Director. Our Board of Directors recommend a vote against this proposal. Xcel Energy has demonstrated sound corporate governance trends for many years, including annual election of Directors, and independent non-employee Directors among its 11 members, an annual election of a lead Independent Director. Board committee is composed entirely of Independent Directors and Committee Chairs review and approve agendas for Committee meeting.","These practices have served our shareholders well. Xcel Energy has consistently delivered on its operational and financial objectives. A strong track record is reflected and [achievement] of total return to shareholders that exceeded our peer group of the EEI investor owned electric and the S&P 500 Index for the 5 year period ending December 2011.","The board believes that it is in the best position to evaluate the current and future needs of the company and to judge how the capabilities of the company\u2019s Directors and Executives can collectively be most effective in meeting those needs.","The Board believes that maintaining flexibility to decide the appropriate leadership structure of the Board is consistent with effective governance by serving the shareholders\u2019 interest and that this proposal would deprive the Board and its ability to govern the company in the manner it seems most effective.","We request that you consider these factors as you vote your proxy in the coming weeks. For more details, I urge you to review the Board\u2019s response to this shareholder proposal in our proxy statement. If you have any questions or comments regarding the content of this year\u2019s proxy, please contact our IR team. That concludes my prepared remarks, operator we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Thanks, good morning.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Hey, Travis.","Teresa S. Madden","","Good morning.","","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","I wanted to go to Minnesota here for a little bit. If you get that property tax deferral there, do you think you can earn the allowed return of 10.37 in 2012, and corollary there, is that embedded in your guidance weather normalized?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","The deferral of the property tax is embedded in our guidance, and the reality is, Travis, even with that deferral, the accounting order for the deferral of property taxes, we want to earn the allowed return of 10.37, I think we anticipate NSP Minnesota would probably be in the low 9.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","What\u2019s the biggest thing driving that, is the capital side or the operating cost side?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Well, I mean it\u2019s this erosion of sales that we\u2019ve seen in Minnesota which is probably the most pronounced in all of our jurisdiction. This is really the \u2013 essentially the second year of staying out or a rate case, and so there is a number of factors like that, that will push that down.","Teresa S. Madden","Ben, I\u2019d just add to that, greatest impact of our weather is in the Minnesota company. So\u2026","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","And then third on that, what risks you see if you file in November. Do you expect based on the negotiations from the previous year, though the risk I\u2019m thinking of in ROE come potentially from even 10.37, disallowance of some kind of operating costs, disallowance of potential capital costs, what are the key risks based on settlement negotiations et cetera from previous case that could go into the November \u201912 base?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","I mean, I think the issues that you raised were always the issues when you ever could follow rate case. I mean, so I would probably say that the ROE would always have to \u2013 and it\u2019s one of the key things we defend. Our capital, Travis, tends to be a much easier sell, particularly because it\u2019s pretty easy to see the value of that return.","I mean this is a year, again, I want to talk about on the call, but we\u2019re starting the year off very strongly with reliability and all the operating indicators that are so important to our customers. And it\u2019s really a reflection of the money we can put in into our system. So at the end of the day, I mean, it\u2019s litigated, it\u2019s as interveners, let\u2019s see it another way, but I think at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got a track record that demonstrates that, we get constructive outcomes. And I think one of the advantage of going to a multi-year plan, like we did in Colorado, is we get that regulatory certainty, and we get a little pause. I mean, I think we have recognized that when you modernize an infrastructure, you follow a lot of rate cases. So, I think it'd be nice to get a multiyear plan or something close to it and kind of get our marching orders and move on with it.","","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, how are you?","Teresa S. Madden","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning, Teresa. Ben, if you look at Colorado, and assuming you do get the settlement approved, at least in Colorado should we assume that that gives you the tools to earn your authorized returns or are there still going to be lag there as well?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Well, Ali, there will still will be some lag. I mean, but I think we will close it a bit and I think we have a little more control of our destiny. And, I mean, Ali we didn't get everything we wanted and then, that's kind of the way it goes when you do a settled agreement, but I think we made a lot of progress, we set the precedent going forward for multi-year plans. And I think if we manage expenses and capital in our business well that we can help eliminate some of that lag that plagued us in Colorado, but we won't cut it out completely by any stretch.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And, I mean, along those lines if you look at your two biggest jurisdictions Minnesota and Colorado, you are looking at multi-year plans, you get into run rate increases you got that in Minnesota as well.","From a logistic point of view, is that a particular functional change that is still required in both of those jurisdictions to be able to earn an authorized ROE, what needs to \u2013 in broad terms, what big item needs to change for you to eliminate the lags in Minnesota and Colorado?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Well, I mean, it will help us to bounce back. I mean, that would be one thing that helps in between rate cases. Ali, it\u2019s some of the expenses that we've had, the pension amortization which hopefully starts to level-off, I think in 2013 and beyond that will help and I mean as we start to \u2013 as our capital forecast starts to flatten-out, albeit at a relatively higher amount than we have seen historically, I think that will be helpful too. I don't know, Teresa, if you want to add anything?","Teresa S. Madden","I think you have covered the major items.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And last question, looking more near-term\u2026","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Ali, can I just\u2026","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yes never mind.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Never obviously add something, but I will take it back. Go ahead.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, I just want to say, near-term, when you look at the trends that you reported in the first quarter, including the tax benefit, was that sort of plugged in to your budget for the year? In other words, was Q1 pretty much on track, because if you took the tax benefit out, that\u2019s about $0.03 swing right there? So just wondering, was that a positive offset to some other slowdown or how should we be thinking about that in the context of your own budget?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","I guess, let me start it out and I\u2019ll have Teresa add. I mean the plan here \u2013 we knew we are planning around this tax benefit. The question was going to be what quarter we would take it in and which is why we don\u2019t do quarterly guidance. So, it was always in our guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 and we knew we had that when we talked about it. So, as far as the timing of it, I think that\u2019s a function of when the planning was completed and some things like that. Teresa, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything.","Teresa S. Madden","I mean, you\u2019re exactly right, Ben. I mean we had assumed a certain level in terms of the tax planning strategy. We actually completed the work at the end of the first quarter. Obviously, we consulted with our auditors about different methodology, the approach, and the amount, and including the timing, and in fact, we determined it was most appropriate to recognize it in the first quarter.","So, again, short answer is, yes, we had assumed a level in our guidance, and in the quarterly estimates, there was some variability in that.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","But earlier today you called out that you\u2019re budgeting a 34% to 35% effective tax rate for the year. Remind me was that not the original plan or is it down from what your original plan was for the tax rate for the year?","Teresa S. Madden","","It's down, it was 34% to 36% originally and which is now at 34% to 35%.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Keep in mind, Ali we expected that this would possibly come in, but weren't necessarily sure on the timing and the ultimate magnitude of it.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it, got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crudel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crudel \u2013 Jefferies","","Hey, good morning. Some questions mainly related to Minnesota and I guess the regulatory environment. You guys plan to file, I guess latter this year, rate case and when you see how sales and also weather had impacted you guys. Is there a potential for I don't know even if it's allowed for like revenue decoupling or something like that in Minnesota? And the second question is, what type of premium does the regulators in Minnesota historically have given for a multiyear rate plan?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","","I don't think there's ever been a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota. So, this would be groundbreaking. And, what was the first part of your question, I'm sorry?","Anthony Crudel \u2013 Jefferies","First question was, is there any ability to get some revenue decoupling or somehow you guys you\u2019re so impacted by either weather or just flat sales if there is some way that you could be made hold for a stuff like that?","","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","I mean that\u2019s always something \u2013 that\u2019s a conversation that potentially we could have, but there's a lot of trade-offs with that and then there's a lot of devil in the details with those sorts of things. So I think we need to continue to evaluate that. There\u2019s others ways that I think accomplish something close to that \u2013 that maybe aren\u2019t as dramatic. But we\u2019ll keep looking at all the adoption.","George E. Tyson II","And Anthony just a point to well we haven't implemented a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota. We have done step increases which is eventually a two-year rate increase. We've done that both in Minnesota, North Dakota and Texas in the last year so that progress towards that multiyear plan.","Anthony Crudel \u2013 Jefferies","It just seems that with flat sales or declining sales, and I know you're getting your step-up increases, but it's tough to have a stay-out of longer than a year, maybe two, just because there's really no incentive where I think you have to say a premium return or some type of premium, like a 50 basis point premium, maybe this as an incentive to book something longer than a year, but to put these sales, it just seems that you're going to always going to earn. Is that a right rate of this situation or no?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","","It depends how big the step increases are and what sales forecast is embedded on that and what kind of exit you have. We do have for example in Colorado, some exit ramps, albeit they are not without their pain, but that's the benefit I think, that's the trade-off and along with that goes with the benefits for multiyear plan. So hopefully, you get your three year plan right, and you've got some true-up mechanisms and other things that such things are maybe outside of your control.","Teresa S. Madden","Maybe just to add to that in terms of the Minnesota sales, the compression we\u2019ve seen has really to spend in the last two quarters and its two quarter the trend potentially, but we\u2019re continuing to watch that. So it\u2019s maybe a little bit early for that larger bit. As Ben said, that's why we're looking at alternatives.","Anthony Crudel \u2013 Jefferies","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi, good morning.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Hi, Dan.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","","I have some questions related around the regulatory issues and rate cases as well. First on Minnesota, you mentioned part of the impact in the first quarter was due to the approved rates being lower than the interim rates a year ago. And I was wondering, how do you, I guess flow through that over recovery will that be over 12 months or how is that done just mechanically. How should we expect that to impact the year-over-year in comparison?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, when we were collecting early on the interim rate, we set up the revenue subject to refund and in essence those are \u2013 we've had all the true-up relative to the income statement, so they are not being given back to the customers. So we will not see any more income statement impact from that revenue subject to refund.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","","It's really, Dan, just the timing of the quarter, first quarter this year to first quarter last year because in first quarter 2011 we were recording at the higher interim rate level, subsequent to that that Teresa mentioned we made adjustments to recognize that.","Teresa S. Madden","And really why we were recording, we were recording at the ROE of 10.88 and the big driver down was 10.37. So\u2026","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. I noticed that you also had similar outcome in North Dakota will that have any impact?","Teresa S. Madden","No.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I just want to verify. I think you said that you expect later this year you are going file electric cases to just say Texas, New Mexico, and Minnesota were those the ones you said?","Teresa S. Madden","Correct.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Yeah.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","","What about the gas case in Minnesota, what was your ROE there, especially given the weak weather related sales and what's your plan for gas rates in Minnesota?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Dan, are you talking about our regulated 2011 return for our gas utility?","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","","Right.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","We don't file that until next week with the regulators.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. You didn't mention anything about gas do you have plans at all that you might be filing?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","We'll evaluate our gas business. I mean keep in mind, Dan, if you have warm, mild winter weather, it doesn't impact your revenue requirements when you file a rate case, because it's normalized. So, you're absolutely right that our gas operations will be under-earning more than we anticipated because of the weather, but there's a number of other factors we have to consider before we file a rate case.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I was a little curious in your write-up about the rate case in South Dakota. You mentioned the staff actually lowered the cost of debt, which is usually an embedded cost. What there a new issue or something that wasn't incorporated that they included that would cause them to lower the cost of debt?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","Dan, I think you stumped the team. I suspect it has to do with capitalization of short-term and long-term and some other capital ratios, but we\u2019ll probably have to take that offline and get back to you.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then I was curious, once you take out the effect of the leap day, the commercial and industrial sales were down almost a percent, weather normalized, I was just wondering if you can give a little more color on what you are seeing since those sales typically aren\u2019t as impacted by weather and what\u2019s going on with your business customers?","Teresa S. Madden","In terms of \u2013 I would say for our large industrial customers in Minnesota and one of our large industrial customers is a paper mill and they\u2019ve discounted a line of paper, they closed the board facility. So you are right, they are no impacted by weather, then we\u2019re just seeing some in their business, business plans changed. In Colorado our big customers are pretty much dismoderating, as they have been. We are not seeing big increases, but we are not seeing decreases either.","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","","The biggest decreases are in this small C&I and the residential and that's really across almost all of our jurisdictions, it's most grounds here in Minnesota. It is a bit perplexing Dan because I mean if you look at the unemployment rates, job growth, et cetera we typically in all of our jurisdictions but we typically do a bit better than the national average.","So, I mean, it could be a number of factors that we're trying to analyze that are causing this trend. One of which might be more shadow effect of our own demand and conservation programs which we know probably take-off about 0.008% of sales and we're compensated for that, but maybe there's more of an impact than we realized.","I think the economy continues to impact customer behavior and then we're also looking at things like we're starting to see appliances get refreshed and maybe seeing some efficiencies there that perhaps we don't have our full handle on. So there\u2019s a lot of things that we're looking at right now.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","","Okay. Then the last one I had was just related to, you mentioned that PS Colorado, the impact from loosing the, or expiration of that wholesale contract Black Hills. Is that going to be continuing year-over-year negative for the rest of this year, when did that contract expire?","Teresa S. Madden","","That contract expired at the end of the year, but we needed to shift from a cost recovery from wholesale to retail customers and that is incorporating in our Colorado settlement.

Fowke III","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Timothy Yee with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Timothy Yee \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning, just to be clear on that, just to be clear on the Minnesota property tax proposal; relative to your guidance, do you think you would still have additional room to find offsets if the deferred property tax in Minnesota is not granted?","Benjamin G.S. Fowke III","We said in the call, I think in the absence of the Commission not giving the $24 million, it\u2019s a pretty big hit to overcome. So I don\u2019t think we could get it without sacrificing things that we won\u2019t sacrifice as far as maintenance of the system. So it would be tough. Now that said, there\u2019s always backup plans and we could ask for reconsideration or we can consider filing our planned rate case in Minnesota early. Those aren\u2019t the preferred routes, obviously.","Timothy Yee \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Okay, fair enough. And just one other question regarding the updated earning guidance assumptions, were there any changes to your CapEx this year kind of driving the lower depreciation expense and the lower AFUDC equity or is that kind of more a function of the expected regulatory outcome?","Teresa S. Madden","We haven\u2019t had any changes yet in terms of our CapEx this year, and while it\u2019s a very small increase, remember in the Minnesota case, we agreed to a $30 million annual reduction in our depreciation expense. So, we\u2019re seeing that reflected in this period, the first quarter\u2019s expense.","Benjamin G.S.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2017 second quarter results, and also update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid earnings for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Bob will provide more detail in a regulatory update. That said, we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance and remain committed to our long-term outlook. We've made significant progress on our Steel for Fuel initiative this quarter, and are executing on our plan to add almost 3,400 megawatts of new wind to our systems by the end of 2020. Earlier this month, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind proposal to add 1,550 megawatts of new wind generation, which includes 400 megawatts of power purchase agreements, and 1,150 megawatts of new rate-based wind, more than doubling our wind ownership. All projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2020, and will qualify for 100% of the PTC tax benefit.","Our Texas, New Mexico proposal to add 1,000 megawatts of self-build wind, and 230 megawatts of Power Purchase Agreements is currently in regulatory review. The proposal has received strong community support, reflecting a significant customer savings and environmental benefits. We expect final decision by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Finally, our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind project in Colorado is under construction, progressing as planned, and is expected to go into service on time in late 2018. Earlier this month, Colorado Governor, Hickenlooper issued an executive order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and join other states that have signed onto the U.S. Climate Alliance.","We are working with stakeholders to develop and advance the plan that will help Colorado achieve the Governor's goals. We will keep you posted on potential developments. Our Steel for Fuel strategy is about making investments that produce significant savings to our customers, which more than offset the capital costs. Another example of this strategy is our recent proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota to terminate four Power Purchase Agreements. This includes the termination of Fibrominn, Laurentian and Pine Bend PPAs. If approved, these actions would result in capital investment of about $100 million, and provide about $650 million in net cost savings to our customers over the next 10 years.","We expect that Minnesota and North Dakota Commissions will review and decide on this valuable customer program before the end of 2017. Providing our customers with reliable energy supply continues to be a company priority and our efforts were once again recognized by the Edison Electric Institute. Last month, EEI presented us with the Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding restoration efforts after Texas winter storm Jupiter in January. This was the third consecutive year Xcel Energy has received this award. I'm proud of the men and women that deliver for our customers every day on behalf of Xcel Energy.","Our employees continually rise to the occasion to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy, frequently under tough conditions with adverse weather and during the holidays when they would prefer to be home with our families. Finally, at Xcel Energy, we're constantly working to integrate new technologies into our operations to enhance public and worker safety, improve efficiency and generate additional savings. A really good example is our recent utilization of drones. We're pioneering the use of drones to inspect project sites, transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, power plant boilers, wind farms and storm damage assessment. We're breaking new ground and have received preliminary approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond the line of sight, and this is just another example of striving to deliver on operational excellence.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We realized another solid quarter of earnings of $0.45 per share in 2017, compared with $0.39 per share in 2016. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share, largely due to the impact of rate increases in non-fuel riders to cover our capital investments, lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share, the lower effective tax rate was mainly due to wind production tax credits which flow back to our customers through a rider or a fuel clause, and lower O&M expenses which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers was increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per share.","Turning to sales, on a weather and leap year adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales improved 0.8%, reflecting approximately 1% growth in the number of customers across most customer classes and jurisdictions, offset by lower use per customer. Natural gas sales increased 1.7% year-to-date on a weather and leap year adjusted basis with a similar story, continued growth in the number of customers, partially offset by a decline in use per customer. While it's too early to call this a trend, it's nice to see that both year-to-date electric and natural gas sales are growing a bit better than expected. We continue to make progress on managing our costs. Quarter-over-quarter, O&M expenses were $19 million lower, largely driven by timing of planned maintenance at our power plants. On a year-to-date basis, our O&M expense is $10 million lower. We're focused on keeping our cost low, and are on track to deliver flat O&M expenses for the full year.","Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update as we've made significant progress during the quarter and continued to execute on our plan. In the second quarter, the Minnesota Commission approved our multi-year electric rate case settlement agreement without modification. This multi-year plan covers 2016 through 2019, and provides the company and customers with revenue and price certainty. It also includes an annual sales true up, and continued use of all existing riders. In Colorado, the commission approved our advanced grid proposal and a decoupling mechanism with some modifications. First, the commission approved our advanced grid settlement. The project includes installing advanced metering infrastructure and communication networks, which will enhance grid reliability, improve the customer experience and enable new programs and rate structures. The settlement spreads the capital investment over a longer timeframe than originally proposed, deferring about $120 million of capital investment beyond our forecast.","Second, the commission approved total class revenue decoupling for residential and small commercial customers. The decoupling adjustment will be based on actual sales, which eliminates the impact of weather. The commission modified our decoupling proposal and plan to file for reconsideration of the decision to calculate the decoupling based on class revenue rather than revenue per customer. We also filed rate cases in Wisconsin and Colorado. In Wisconsin, we filed to increase electric rates by $25 million and natural gas rates by $12 million. The filing is based on a 2018 forward test year, a 10% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in the fourth quarter and final rates to be effective January of 2018.","In Colorado, we filed a multi-year natural gas case seeking new revenues of $139 million over three years. The filing is based on a series of forward test years, an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55%. We expect a commission decision and implementation of final rates in February of 2018. We're also planning to file electric cases in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico over the next several months.","With that, I'll wrap up. Overall, it was an excellent quarter. We received regulatory approvals for a multi-year electric case in our wind proposals in Minnesota. In Colorado, the commission approved a decoupling mechanism in our advanced grid settlement. We filed proposals with the Minnesota and North Dakota commissions for termination or modification of higher cost PPAs, which will provide significant reductions to customer bills.","Finally, we posted strong financial results for the quarter, and are well-positioned to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning Ali.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Ben our Bob, when we go back, your original base CapEx plans 2017 through 2021 was $18.4 billion. So when you look at some of the projects on the wind side that have been approved, you had mentioned some delay or a push out, I should say, on the AMI in Colorado. Net-net, what is that $18.4 billion looking like right now?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, Ali, we haven't updated our capital guidance based on the updated wind and the effects of AEGIS and other capital impacts. And we expect to do that in normal course as we usually do in the third quarter. (11:28) a few moving parts. I mean, so as said last quarter, you can't expect it to go up the full amount of what's been approved, and we've obviously added the biomass opportunity in there, but there's some moving parts, and as Bob said, we'll have a full updated CapEx forecast third quarter.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And if I just recall from previous disclosures, the incremental new wind projects, if all of them get approved, if I remember correctly, was roughly about $700 million, does that sound right?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And of that, Bob, just to be clear, the ones that you have gotten approved for Minnesota, how much of that $700 million is now officially blessed by the regulators?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Ali, I think that the approval of our 400 megawatts of build-own-transfer wind projects in Minnesota would realize all that $700 million.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. So that's all done. And if I heard you right, Bob, you also said, in Colorado, there's about $120 million that has been pushed in outer years on the AMI spend.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","That's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So those are two distinct data points that are incremental. Among the other numbers you were mentioning, at least among those, is there anything else incremental to keep an eye on from our perspective?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No, nothing discreet at this point, Ali. We're just working through the normal process of updating all of our capital plans for all of our operating companies.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Ali, we're also waiting for approval of the SPS 1,000 megawatts, which is approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of CapEx.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right, so that's not in there yet. Got it. Second question, the 12-month earned operating ROE, I believe was 8.98%. If my math is right, that reflects roughly about a 60-basis point lag versus authorized. Does that sound about right?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, how many points did you say?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","60?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, that's right.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And Bob, is the goal, I mean, given frictional timing issues, et cetera, what's the sort of the theoretical maximum you can push that? Are we pretty close to that right now?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Ali, we've been committed to trying to close the lag in our earn to actual ROEs. We first started talking about this, I think our consolidated allowed was closer to 9.8% and we were earning closer to 8.9%. So we've obviously brought the bottom end of that number up. The top end has come down slightly, our weighted average authorized is closer to 9.6% now. I think in our first quarter call, we provided guidance that we were looking to be in or around where we were last year, and we hope to close that gap sometime in 2018.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And last question, as you look at these CapEx spending opportunities, and I know you'll scrub it all out and give it to us in Q3, but clearly, the bias is towards more spending in renewable. There seems to be support for that, the wind project, et cetera, you talked about in SPS. So when you put it all together, are you still looking at a 4% to 6% EPS CAGR? Is there some shared issuance dilution that keeps you there, or should we assume that as CapEx is going up mathematically, if shares are not going up, that should cause EPS CAGR to go up as well?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, Ali, this is Ben. We are certainly pleased that we got the approval in Minnesota. We continue to look for opportunities to add new wind. I think the Minnesota Commission is comfortable, if we can bring them good projects to even do more. Still going to get the approval down at SPS. It's a big part of that CapEx upside. So all those things happen, I think we're pushing towards the upper end of our range, and we don't have to issue equity. I think that's important to note. I mean, there's some debt that goes with that, but we don't have to issue equity. So I think we're well-positioned to be at the top of that 4% to 6% guidance range, particularly for this forecast period, but we haven't changed the long-term growth rate at this point.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the SPS wind project approvals. I think in the past, you'd stated that you were hoping to get approval by year-end in both New Mexico \u2013 in Texas. And at the very least, you could get recovery of those projects through a general rate case filing, but you would also consider asking for some kind of rider mechanism to get them. Could you just kind of walk us through the specifics of upfront, what you need to hear from both commissions before you greenlight the projects, and when you expect that?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, sure, we can do that. Let me just say, I think, it's going to be more like the first quarter of 2018 for the final approval. We're on the ground, getting a lot of community support, legislative support. I think these projects are very popular for their obvious economic benefits. So this is about a $1.6 billion spend. I believe that increases our rate base and SPS by about 40%. As we know, we've suffered from some pretty significant lag at SPS. So our proposal is that we need concurrent recovery. The benefits are going to flow immediately to our customers. They're going to be significant. We need to get immediate recovery. And I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll get that, and we're going to need to get that. I mean, this is too big of an investment to put into place and suffer the historic lag we typically have. So that's what it's all about and that's what we're working on right now.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then your conversation so far with the various stakeholders, commissioners, and other interveners, are leading you to positive conclusion so far?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, we haven't heard anything that would suggest that we can't work through a settlement, and that would be the ideal outcome. But these things take time.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then I was pleased to see the announcement of the PPA buyouts today. Relatively small numbers overall in the scheme of things, but certainly attractive opportunity going forward. Are there more of these, what's the magnitude and could you maybe give us a little bit of color on the counter parties there, and maybe why in your opinion they were willing to take upfront cash in exchange for a stream of cash flows over time that they would have otherwise gotten through the PPA?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, let me just first step back and say, I'm really excited about this. It's not a big capital investment for us, but $650 million of net cost savings, that's pretty significant to our customers. And I think if these all are proved, even after the cost to buy out the projects and all the other things you have to do to get the deals done, I think you're looking at about a 3% rate decrease for our customers, and that's great, and that's consistent with what we're trying to do, is continue to reduce carbon emissions while keeping rates flat and improving the customer experience. I think that's the right mix, and that's the right approach and this is more evidence we can get it done.","How many more opportunities are out there? I think that remains to be seen. I don't think there's a ton, to be honest with you, but we're going to continue to look for anything we can do that helps save customers' money and provides us an investment opportunity at the same time. I would say that, what's the rationale for the counterparties to do this, I would look at the Fibrominn plant, which is the largest of the three projects, I mentioned. This was a project that had emerged from bankruptcy. It's always been a project where it's very expensive to the customer, but I think razor thin margins if not worse for the counterparties. So I mean, it's an economic proposition from their end when they do their NPVs and discounted cash flows, and it's obviously positive for our customer. So it's a real win-win for everybody.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Chris, it's Bob. As Ben said, the reason and the rationale for the counterparties is really that the benefit to the customers is the fuel cost. The owners of the assets aren't making significant margins on the assets. The benefit to the customer is to get rid of a significantly high fuel cost that is relatively a pass-through to the other side's owners.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And do you recall the original motivation of the PPA signing from your perspective, or was it part of PRPA or was it something else, RPS, et cetera?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Chris, do you want to take that one? This one dates back quite a ways.","Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Sure. This is Chris Clark, President of NSP-Minnesota. This dates back to the 1994 legislative proposals in Minnesota that allowed us to store spent fuel at our nuclear facility, and required us to enter into 125 megawatts of biomass power purchase agreements. That was later revised to 110 megawatts. So this has quite a history.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very interesting. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Paul. Good morning.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","The SPS turbines, are they qualified for 100% PTC?","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, 100%.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And that's a big chunk of intermittent capacity to drop in the market. Does the existing fleet have the ramping ability to follow that, or is there a follow on opportunity around rapid ramping gas plants?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","We believe we can integrate that into our existing system with the existing portfolio of resources. I mean, this is \u2013 and obviously when you pencil it out versus firing up gas and coal facilities, it makes economic sense. So we have looked at that very closely, Paul, and believe it works.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And the $1.6 billion, how is that apportioned between the different jurisdictions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","The plants, the wind farms, there's two wind farms, one is 478 megawatts, one is 522 megawatts. You should consider the total capital dollars being split roughly on that ratio.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I think what you're talking about what jurisdictions, Paul. Is that what you mean, percentage?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Let me \u2013 give me some help here. I think Texas is about what, 60%?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Texas is about 50%, SPS or New Mexico is about 20%, wholesale is about 30%.","Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So that's how it will be allocated.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, New Mexico can be troublesome, my words, not yours. How are the discussions there going?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, again, I think the stakeholder outreach has been incredibly supportive. And that's I think going to be helpful, Paul, as we try to get the concurrent recovery that we need to do this great economic benefit for our customers. We all have to \u2013 shareholders have to participate in it too. So again, as I said previously, I'm cautiously optimistic we'll get this over the finish line with the kind of recovery we need to make it successful for all stakeholders.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And if you get to that point, do we need to reshuffle the capital deck and push more projects out, or I mean, I think you have tremendous support for equity, if you need equities projects, given the economics?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","I appreciate that support, but at this point, we don't need equity.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I was wondering, as you add all these wind farms on and all the capacity here, kind of a follow up to Paul's question, what additional investment do you need that might not already be anticipated? And kind of, if you go back to previous projects you've got, what have you found either in terms of operating costs or capital costs that were needed in addition to the price tag for the actual turbines installation?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, listen, let me take this two ways, I'll answer your question directly. When we price out the economics of these wind farms, we assume any kind of incremental ancillary costs that might be occurred, and I think we do a very good job of realistically looking at that, the additional transmission build-out, et cetera, Travis. Wind is fuel, and hence Steel for Fuel. And I do think that opens up the opportunity to have dialogues with our key stakeholders around the retirement of some of our fossil plants, principally, coal plants. And if you look forward, I think what that does for us is the opportunity to do more Steel for Fuel, and more steel, frankly, as we get beyond this forecast period. I mentioned in my remarks that Governor Hickenlooper issued an executive order in Colorado. I think that's going to create another wave of opportunities for us to add more renewables to the system as we start to look at the potential retirements of some coal plants. But again, this tranche of renewables wind, we can integrate into our system with some ancillary costs, which are baked into the LCOEs that we're quoting to our commissions.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And at what level do you think you'll start running into some of those integration issues (26:36) percentage of wind or other renewables on the system intermittent?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So we're going to continue to advance carbon reduction. and we're going to do that with affordability in mind. I think we're uniquely positioned to do that. I'm really pleased to see some of my colleagues are doing the same thing, I think it's the right thing to do. And when we start to get to those next incremental tranches, we start looking I think more at solar and wind, then you have to start looking at potential coal retirements, replacing that with a portion of backup gas, most likely CT, to make sure we have a reliability and other things we need on our system in the ramping capacity. So Travis, that's probably in the 2020s that when we start to really aggressively do that. I am really excited about it. I think the energy future for our jurisdictions is going to be a bright one. I think we can achieve remarkable de-carbonization goals and I think we can do that would affordability in mind, and that's what we're striving to do every single day.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. So what does it mean, concurrent recovery? Is it a rider? Is it a forward text year? How do you envision that for SPS?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, Angie, I think we can be pretty flexible, actually, how we get that concurrent recovery. And there's a number of different \u2013 I think we made a suggestion in the filing and we're open to the ideas. But the important thing is that we don't suffer the lag as we traditionally have done. So those settlement discussions are taking place, and there's different pathways we can take to achieve those outcomes. We're not really wedded to anything as long as we get what we need from real-time recovery.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And would you need legislative actions in order to get it done?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","No.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And now, so I know that nothing is happening in Washington, but what if there were to be a change in the corporate tax rate, how would it play into your plan for adding renewables? Would you ever consider maybe using tax equity investors to help you monetize the tax benefits of the wind farms?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, that's a really great question, Angie. While nothing seems to be happening in Washington, we're spending, I know I am, with some of my colleagues, making sure we advocate for the right kind of tax reform if it were to happen, and that basically, we don't believe the trade for 100% capital expense in exchange for non-deductibility of the interest expense is a good trade at all for shareholders or customers. And frankly, we've told them that bonus depreciation isn't a good trade, if that means a higher effective tax rate. And I think, by the way, we've gotten a good traction on that. So I think our industry is being recognized by legislators as unique. Where tax reform goes? I don't know. I mean, I've said that all along when this was all talked about. We'll see where it goes. I think we'll always be opportunistic if things like tax equity makes sense we would look at it, but that's not our plans right now.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I'm asking simply because when you calculate the benefits right to the customer, the present value of that benefit is highly dependent on your ability to monetize the tax credits, no? The timeframe over which you can monetize it.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, these projects have a lot of tax benefits associated with them, so the effective tax rate does matter. But even if you stress test this to the max, these projects are still going to be good projects, and I think that's the key. And ultimately, I think as the technology improves, it will continue to be good values in the next when we talk fast forward 10 years from now, I think these technologies, even without tax benefits will compete very nicely with fossil fuel alternatives. So that's always something we have to be aware of and we are. We track it. But right now, I mean, they're deeply in the money for our customers.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Zou (31:30) with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hey, Ben, it's Andy Levi. How are you doing?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Andy, how are you doing?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Good. Very good quarter for you guys, as always. Just very quick, similar question that was asked earlier, and that I've asked in the past. So as it's obvious, you're trending very easily towards, I think you said, and obviously some other callers, I think it was Ali, towards the high end of your 4% to 6% growth rate, I guess it's somewhat, I don't want to say, in the bag. But at what point \u2013 and I've asked this on every call over the last couple of quarters, do you really take a look at changing that growth rate, and at the very least, eliminating the low end?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, we'll continue to look at it, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made. We've got some more things to do, Andy. We don't have the SPS wind deals approved. We got to watch and see how some of the rate cases, that Bob mentioned, proceed. So I mean, there are still some moving pieces. I'm comfortable letting you know that we're trending towards the top of that range, and that's what our goal is going to be. And as I said before, so I can't really add anything new to it, we'll continue to look and evaluate what we think our long-term growth rate is. I do agree with you that the actions we've taken and the success we've had so far would probably indicate that there's certainly much more opportunity to hit the 6% than there is risk that will only be at 4%. I hope people can be comfortable with that.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","And if everything kind of on the regulatory front, kind of goes your way, do you see yourself exceeding the 6%, or is the 6% kind of the max?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, that's the kind of the analysis we have to continue to do. And at this point, we're saying 4% to 6%, Andy. So I think I just got to leave it there.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And then just more of an industry question because kind of looking at what you guys are doing, and then obviously the big AEP announcement as well, and again, just thoughts on a very high level. But clearly, the utilities are being much more aggressive, extremely aggressive in kind of building out their own renewable footprints versus let's say several years ago, PPAs. So what do you think that means for kind of renewable developers, whether, I mean, obviously NextEra has an outstanding renewable business, and is growing in leaps and bounds. So maybe, they're not as effective. But then you have kind of marginal players like AGR and other smaller developers as well. So just kind of your thoughts on, is the market big enough to support them all or do we continue to see this trend whether it's large utilities like yours or Alliant, is another example, kind of just doing it on their own because economics are good and you're able to?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Well, Andy, I guess, I would look at it this way. I mean, I think the overall pie is getting bigger. As renewables compete directly and win on economics versus the more traditional fossil alternative, that's means we're going to have a lot more renewables on the system. And we certainly are, and when I look forward to 2030, we're going to continue to advance smart renewables, large-scale renewables that save customers money. Now, how that happens? I think that depends.","I do think NextEra is well-positioned. I mean, they do a good job. There's others that do a good job. But if you notice, even in the megawatts that we're going to own in this \u2013 what we talked about with wind, they're some significant component of build-own-transfer. And so I think you're going to see more and more of that from all developers where this is a prime time type of asset to own, and I think utilities are going to want to own these assets, and they're going to be looking to either self build as we've done or contract with developers to own those once they are getting ready to go into service under a build-own-transfer concept. So I think you will see less PPAs. But if the overall pie increases, I'm not sure everybody doesn't have a chance to participate in the market, at least the good ones.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Got it. Thank you so much.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Thanks Andy.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for the follow up. Ben, you've obviously been on the forefront of renewable. Where are you with regards to storage and willing to put capital to work there?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","You talking like specifically batteries?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we're continuing to look at how batteries can be deployed on our system, and I think the prices have to come down more on our system. We're relatively low cost compared to other regions of the country. But I think they will come down, Paul, and I think battery technology will play an increasingly bigger role on our system. And you see stuff where renewables compared with batteries have come in at a pretty good price point. You can have some of that. I don't believe that renewables combined with batteries replace CT gas turbines completely. I mean, you still need that 24x7 backup capacity. You still need spinning mass on the system. There's a number of things like that. But I believe that you'll see us when the economics are right, be it ready to deploy batteries. In the meantime, we're doing it on a pilot basis to really understand all the value streams, how they stack up and how this can be a resource going forward. To me, it's not unlike solar where solar was 10 years ago. And as it gets ready for prime time, on our system, we'll look to invest in it.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Maybe prime time on your system a little bit later because you're already in such a good place from a price standpoint?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.","Yes, I mean, it will be driven by economics, but that said, I see that day coming, so we will be positioned to be there when it's ready.","Paul T.

Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call and are available on our web page. ","Before we begin, let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.","Ben Fowke","Thanks Paul and good morning. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Xcel Energy enjoyed another successful year. I\u2019ll review some of the highlights from 2011 and also comment on some of the challenges we face in 2012. Teresa will then discuss our 2011 results in greater detail.","As you probably read in this morning\u2019s press release, we reported 2011 earnings of $1.72 per share, compared with $1.62 per share in 2010, representing a 6% increase. We feel good about delivering earnings results in the upper half of our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. This marks the seventh consecutive year that we have met or exceeded our annual earnings objective.","We were also successful in meeting our other financial objectives. We raised an annual dividend of $0.03 per share or 3% to $1.04 per share and we maintained our strong credit ratings. Continuing to meet our financial objectives is certainly important; however, I\u2019m equally proud that we delivered a high level of system reliability in a year that clearly presented us with some weather related challenges. ","In addition to our hot summer throughout our service territory, we experienced some rather noteworthy storms in 2011, including a tornado in a densely populated Minneapolis neighborhood and early season snowstorms in the Denver area. All of these storms resulted in significant damage and widespread power outages.","I commend our employees for how rapidly and thoroughly they responded to these challenging events, restoring service in all situations in record time. Delivering value to our customers has led to a record customer satisfaction rating of 93% in 2011, slightly above the 92% rating we received in 2009 and 2010. ","We had some significant operational successes in 2011 that should position us to continue to provide a high level of service to our customers for many years to come. To name a few, the NRC renewed the operating license for our Prairie Island plants, authorizing the units to generate emission free base load generation for another 20 years. ","In Texas we put the Jones 3 combustion turbine into service one year early and substantially under budget. At NSP, the MISO Board approved multi value project status for the Brookings Hampton line with the projected investment by Xcel Energy of $480 million and we had the first segments of SB100, Power for the Plains and the CapX2020 transmission projects, which totaled over 180 miles going to service. ","In addition, Xcel Energy was named to the 2011-2012 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. This is the fifth year we earned a place in the Index, which includes companies considered to be best in class in terms of economic, environmental and social performance. Xcel Energy also ranked second at a 2,500 publicly traded companies on Trust Across America\u2019s 2011 list of Most Trustworthy Companies in the United States. ","Another positive event occurred in late 2011 when the D.C. Circuit Court suspended the order on CSAPR. This is great news for our customers, particularly in Texas. The unexpected inclusion of Texas under CSAPR created significant issues for SPS. With limited options to comply by 2012, our plan was to alter the dispatching of our plants in Texas by simultaneously reducing the energy output of our coal plants, while increasing the operation of our natural gas plants. ","This stay allows us to defer the rules significant cost increases and potential reliability problems, which would have affected our customers SPS. We are hopeful that the court\u2019s decision on the merits of the rule expected later this year, will enable us to comply in a more reasonable, cost effective manner. ","Our five-year capital forecast includes about $470 million for CSAPR. While it\u2019s possible the timing and the total investment may change, we don\u2019t plan to revise our forecast until there\u2019s more clarity surrounding the court\u2019s final determination on the rule. ","So 2011 was a good year. Unfortunately 2012 is not beginning as we had anticipated. As we noted in mid-January, the Colorado\u2019s Commissions decision to deny our request for interim rate increase of $100 million poses a challenge for us as we start the year. In addition, our fourth quarter weather normalized electric sales declined slightly, something we haven\u2019t experienced since 2009. As a result, our annual weather adjusted sales growth was only six-tenth of a percent in 2011. This leads us to believe that sales growth in 2012 could potentially be weaker than we originally forecasted. ","Compounding the negative sales trend, the winter has been relatively mild thus far. We estimate that the mild weather in January will reduce first quarter earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. ","Finally, we received our property tax statements in December and they were higher than we anticipated for both 2011 and 2012. The combination of these factors creates some headwinds for us. Fortunately it\u2019s early in the year, so we have time to take action and we are. ","While we are facing some challenges as we begin 2012, I believe our long-term prospects remain very favorable. Specifically, I believe the recent setback in Colorado is not indicative of an erosion in the regulatory compact. While the Colorado Commission did not authorize interim rates, they did approve an accounting order that will allow us to establish a regulatory asset to offset the impact of the expiration of the Black Hills contract. This decision represents about $0.02 per share to our projected 2012 earnings. ","Additionally, we are implementing actions to reduce O&M expenses, which are expected to partially offset the impact of the headwinds I mentioned. We\u2019ve established a solid track record of delivering on our financial objectives and we intend to do so in 2012. ","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Teresa Madden.","Teresa Madden","Thanks Ben and good morning. Today I will discuss our year-end results, pending rate cases and 2012 earnings guidance. Let\u2019s begin with a review of 2011 results at each of our operating companies. ","PSCo earnings decreased $0.04 per share for the year. The decrease is due to the implementation of seasonal rates in June 2010, higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather last summer. ","At NSP-Minnesota, earnings increased $0.13 per share, largely due to interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota and conservation incentives, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation and property taxes. ","Earnings at SPS increased $0.01 per share, largely due to an electric rate increase in Texas and higher sales driven again by record-breaking hot summer weather. These positive items were also partially offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense. ","Finally, 2011 NSP Wisconsin earnings increased $0.01 per share. The positive impact of new electric rates was partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. ","I will now discuss some of the primary drivers on the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. In 2011, retail electric margin increased by $334 million. Significant drivers include a $102 million increase from interim and finance rates in multiple states, $124 million increase in revenue requirements reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado in late 2010. ","This margin impact is partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes and financing costs associated with these facilities. Finally, we met or exceeded our conservation in DSM targets, which resulted in a $45 million increase from higher conservation and DSM revenue and incentives. ","For the year, natural gas margin increased by a modest $28 million, driven primarily by conservation and DSM revenue, as well as weather. ","Partially offsetting the improvement in our electric and natural gas margins were increases in a few expense categories. O&M expenses increased $83 million or 4%, largely driven by increased plant generation, labor and employee benefit cost. Our O&M expenses came largely in line with our expectations for the year. ","Depreciation expense also offset some of the improvement in margins, increasing $32 million or 3.7%. The increase was driven by incremental capital investments representing an additional 1,800 megawatts of generation, including several larger projects that went into service such as a portion of the Monticello nuclear power upgrade come into Q3, the Minnesota Nobles wind project, two natural gas plants in Colorado that we acquired from Calpine and our SPS Jones 3 Unit addition. ","However, the annual increase in depreciation expense was reduced by $30 million due to deprecation life changes agreed to in the settlement with various parties and the pending Minnesota Electric rate case. ","As Ben mentioned, we experienced higher property taxes, primarily in Colorado and Minnesota, which led to a $43 million or 12.9% increase in taxes other than income. ","Last year was another busy and largely constructive year for us on the regulatory front. In addition to completing several rate cases that I will detail in a few moments, it\u2019s also important to recognize some new mechanisms were approved that are designed to reduce regulatory lag. ","For example; in Colorado, we received approval for a new rider towards the cover cost associated with the Natural Gas Pipeline Integrity Management Program. In Texas, we received legislative approval to implement a distribution rider and in Minnesota we gained legislative approval for a multiyear rate plan. ","I will now touch on some of our recently completed rate cases. In December, the New Mexico Commission approved our settlement agreement to increase electric rates by $13.5 million effective in January 2012. In Wisconsin, the Commission approved a $12.2 million electric rate increase and a $2.9 million natural gas increase, both effective last month. ","We reached settlement agreements in our Minnesota and North Dakota electric rate cases last year and expect decisions by the respective commissions during the first quarter of 2012. As you might remember, interim rates for both states were effective in January 2011 and settlement agreements include step increases in 2012. ","In South Dakota, we implemented an interim rate increase of $12.7 million last month. We continue to anticipate that the commission will decide this case in the first half of the year. ","We\u2019ll continue to pursue constructive regulatory outcomes in 2012. Of course, our pending Colorado electric case will be of great significance during the first half of the year. We\u2019ve requested a $142 million increase and anticipate that final rates will be effective in the July-August timeframe. We are optimistic that the Commission will support the use of the forecast test year, which our request is based upon. In addition, we continue to explore the potential of multi-year rate plans with key stakeholders to determine whether this approach can be achieved through a settlement. ","Other expected rate cases to be filed in 2012 include a 2013 Wisconsin rate case, and in Minnesota we continue to proceed with plans to file a 2013 electric case in November. This request may include a multi-year plan. Finally, we will consider filing rate cases in some of our other jurisdictions. ","Turning to our outlook for 2012, Ben already highlighted some of the challenges. I\u2019ll reiterate; it\u2019s early in the year and we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the decision by the Colorado Commission to deny our interim rate request. As a result we now forecast 2012 earnings per share to be in the lower half of the $1.75 to $1.85 range. ","Achieving 2012 earnings in the lower half of the range would be consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective. Using 2009 as the base year, the lower half of the 2012 guidance range represents 5% to 6% compound and earnings growth. ","Certain events entering 2012 were unique. Looking ahead, you shouldn\u2019t anticipate that we will provide future quarterly updates or color regarding where we expect to end up in the guidance range. ","As noted in today\u2019s release, we\u2019ve updated some of the guidance assumptions. We lowered our expected increase in O&M expenses to reflect the management actions we have implemented. We also added an assumption related to the increase in property taxes. It\u2019s important to recognize that we requested a deferral of the 2012 increase in property taxes in Minnesota, consistent with our settlement in the rate case. The guidance range assumes a favorable outcome with respect to that request. ","In summary, 2011 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered on our financial objectives; we exceeded our energy efficiency and conservation program targets; we anticipated and responded to adverse weather events in a timely and responsible manner and as a result, we improved our historically high levels of customer service. ","Our efforts were also reflected in our stock price, which rose more than 17% in 2011 and hit a nine-year high during the last day of December. We delivered a total return in excess of 22%. ","Looking ahead, we\u2019ve outlined some challenges we face in 2012, but as our track record demonstrates, we are committed to delivering on our financial objectives, while providing excellent service and value to our customers. I am confident we\u2019ll deliver on those commitments again this year. ","That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Thanks. Good morning.","Ben Fowke","Hey Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","On all the regulatory activity that you guys have in process and you expect over the next year, year and a half, how concerned are you about ROE cuts that could come under 10% rather, given where interest rates are and some other rate case decisions we\u2019ve seen across the U.S.?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think it\u2019s a concern Travis and we\u2019ve talked about it before, that the trend is to see lower authorized ROEs. I\u2019d certainly hope we don\u2019t go below 10%, but as you also have heard as I talked about before, I think we have upside even in a falling authorized ROE environment if we can close that regulatory lag that we talk about through things like multi year and the riders that Teresa talked about, so that we actually can make up more ground than we might lose on the authorized basis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay. What did you earn in 2011 rather across your service territories?","Ben Fowke","Correct me if I\u2019m wrong Teresa, but on a consolidated basis, I think we earned about 10%. But remember, that reflects a little bit of debt at the holding company, so I would say our average ROE earned at the OPCo\u2019s was probably in low 9%.","Teresa Madden","They ranged 9% to 10% or just that, except for SPS was slightly lower.","Ben Fowke","Yes, so our aggregates probably about low 9% I would think.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Thank you and good morning.","Ben Fowke","Hi Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Ben, to be clear on the Colorado situation, as I recall, after they denied your interim request, you went back with another interim request at a lower amount. Where do we stand on that and is that still possible that they could grant that?","Ben Fowke","They denied that too at the same time that they suggested that we look at the accounting order approach, which as you know we took them up on that suggestion and they did approve that just recently here. That has, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks about a $0.02 positive impact and helps to mitigate the denial of the interim rates.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay, okay. And as you mentioned low 9% ROEs at the OPCo level in \u201811, what\u2019s embedded in the \u201812 guidance assuming as you mentioned you end up in that lower end of the range. What should be the corresponding OPCo ROE roughly there?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think some of the things we\u2019ve talked about, like multi year plans, etcetera certainly are going to help. I think that impact would be more evident in 2013 than 2012. I mean we had the setback on the interim rates as we entered this year. So I suspect that we will probably have about the same kind of ROE at the consolidated level in \u201812 that we have in \u201811.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Consolidated, and also at the OPCo as well, the same thing?","Ben Fowke","Yes, I mean it will be variance. Go ahead Teresa.","Teresa Madden","Yes, it will range in the 9% up to 10% amongst the OPCos. Generally the range, whoever has a rate case in that period, like we will earn a little higher, so if we look at \u201811, Minnesota is slightly higher than Colorado and then it will flip around. So this is somewhat driven, but they are all within that range. It has new rates.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And Teresa if I heard you correctly earlier, is it fair to say that when you look at lag across the system, is SPS, does that have the largest lag between authorized and earned right now or how would you categorize your biggest lag utilities at this point?","Teresa Madden","Yes, I would say it\u2019s the largest. Their rates are set on a historical test year. So we do see the largest lag and we have less riders in Texas as well.","Ben Fowke","Ali, keep in mind though that SPS has made some pretty significant improvements as we all know from where we were just a few years ago. So, we continue to, I think improve the regulatory compact there and look to do that in future years as well.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Yes, and also one other clarification. Teresa, I think you mentioned the property tax deferral in Minnesota, you asked for that and you\u2019ve assumed you\u2019ll get it. Can you remind us how big of an amount that is?","Teresa Madden","Yes, it\u2019s $28 million and it\u2019s both electric and gas. So even though it came out of the electric case, it\u2019s for both businesses.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay, last question, given your assumptions and guidance, fair to assume you\u2019re not looking at any scenario that would cause you to issue equity in \u201812 or could that change depending on stock price, performance, etcetera?","Ben Fowke","Well, I think as we\u2019ve indicated before, we are not planning to issue any equity in \u201812, but we\u2019ll be opportunistic and if we see conditions that would warrant that, we would consider entering into a forward transaction. So we are still in the same position and consistent with we\u2019ve previously indicated.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Thank you very much.","Teresa Madden","Your welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Thank you. I have two questions. The first one is about the retail sales and the weather analyzed load growth. You mentioned that it was disappointing in the fourth quarter and I\u2019m just wondering, is this just purely the economic slowdown or is this sustainable conservation?","Ben Fowke","We were disappointed I think in the last quarter of 2011, which drove the overall year to just a little over a half or six-tenths of a percent. It\u2019s a little bit perplexing, because while haven\u2019t been immune to the recession, generally our states have done very well. Lower unemployment; we\u2019re seeing jobs growth and we didn\u2019t lose as many jobs and where we are seeing a lot of the fall off is in the residential and small C&I. ","I wish I had a better explanation for you, but outside of our DSM programs, which probably account for about seven-tenths of a percent of the fall-off and as you know Angie, we are compensated for that; it\u2019s a little harder to explain.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","There\u2019s clearly a trend that we are seeing across the country and pretty much every single utility now says that it has nothing to do with conservation, it\u2019s nor the economy, but yet at DSM macroeconomic indicators seems to be at least mix and maybe slightly even positive and so it\u2019s just hard to believe that pretty much every single region has seen the flattish weather normalized power sales.","Ben Fowke","Well, I mean typically you can add 70 basis points back to whatever our sales are because of our DSM programs. So I would definitely say our DSM programs are having the intended effect, but then once you get past that, whether it\u2019s efficiencies we don\u2019t know about or change in consumer behaviors or there\u2019s a lot of different theories, household consolidation, etcetera, we are not quite sure, but we are certainly seeing it and we are going to have to continue to monitor it.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Okay. My second question is about CSAPR. I recall that you guys mentioned that if CSAPR was in fact implemented on January 1, you would have ran your gas plants more, which in turn would increase your O&M expenses. Now that CSAPR has stayed, that you don\u2019t have to tick up in expenses, shouldn\u2019t that be helping your 2012 guidance?","Ben Fowke","Well Angie, the biggest impact of having to basically turn our dispatch order upside down was the increase in fuel expense, so not the O&M expense, so not too much of a delta on the O&M there.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Okay, okay, that\u2019s fine. Thank you very much.","Ben Fowke","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Thanks. I guess when the interim rate relief was originally denied and you guys talked about earning at the low end of the guidance range, the impact of that seems to be on the order of magnitude about a nickel and it looks like you\u2019ve got $0.025 back obviously, based on your ability to defer the Black Hills contract. ","So I\u2019m just wondering, since you\u2019re still sort of projecting the low end of your guidance range, did something happen between then and now that\u2019s making you more concerned about other parts of your operation, be it slower load growth or more difficulty potentially in cutting O&M?","Ben Fowke","No. I mean I think the original request would have had about \u2013 I think we had it more, I guess $0.06 if we had everything we asked for, which we typically don\u2019t and then we have the account in order to your point which knocks off $0.02 of that, so it\u2019s a setback. ","It\u2019s certainly helpful. I think we have a much better opportunity to work our way up towards the middle of the range now as a result, but we continue to have some of the other headwinds that I talked about. We just talked about sales. This has been, I think the fourth warmest winter on record in Minnesota and I don\u2019t have the results for Colorado, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are not similar and that\u2019s impacting us $0.02, and frankly February is starting out pretty warm too. So those are the things along with property taxes that we\u2019ll have to concentrate on. ","We do have plans to mitigate that to some O&M reductions and that will help too. So the order I think was a definite improvement and again, if we get a few breaks we\u2019ll push it back towards the middle.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Based on what you just said, the weather impact so far, you would calculate at about $0.02 negative for the first quarter?","Ben Fowke","Through January, it was $0.02 negative, roughly.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Thank you.","Ben Fowke","Your welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Just go ahead.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi, good morning. ","Ben Fowke","Hey Dan.","Teresa Madden","Morning.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","First think I was wanting to ask about was, you laid out your CapEx on Page 11 of the release and you put a note in there related to the CSAPR. I just wondered if you could give us a little more color on if the stay were removed, with CapEx should have laid out there for CSAPR stay the same or would that have to be moved in some way?","Ben Fowke","Well, you\u2019re kind of hitting on it Dan. There\u2019s three outcomes, right. They could be reinstated. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very high likelihood, but it\u2019s certainly possible. It could be repealed completely, which I do think is a possibility or the courts could remand it back to the EPA and ask if they\u2019d modify it in some way. ","So we currently have 474 I think or 470 in there for CapEx. If it was reinstated now, we\u2019ll spend about that amount. If it\u2019s repealed, we might not have to spend anything at least in the near term. I think some other rules eventually might catch us, but it certainly will be very favorable, and then somewhere in between if it\u2019s remanded. So I mean obviously that\u2019s about $0.5 billion swing, but that\u2019s where we are right now.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and if the current rules were enforced, would that impact any of your plants as far as being retired?","Ben Fowke","No, you\u2019re saying if the core came back and just basically restated everything?","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Right.","Ben Fowke","We would be back to the plan that we entered the year with and we would, we\u2019d be looking at different dispatches, hopefully find some allowances in the market. We haven\u2019t had a lot of success as you know and we talked about that and we would plan to put the CapEx in. So hopefully that doesn\u2019t happen, at least not with an extension of the compliance base.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. The another thing I had was on your pending rate cases, your ongoing rate cases, where you don\u2019t have the settlements and basically in Colorado Electric and South Dakota Electric. I was wondering what the last authorized ROE is versus what you requested? I think you would lay out what the requested ROE is, but I was curious how those compare with what the last authorized ROEs were.","Ben Fowke","The last authorized ROE in Colorado was 10.5%.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","How about in South Dakota?","Ben Fowke","10% for South Dakota.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo","Good morning everyone. Just a quick question on the interim rates and the setback there, and this maybe speculative in nature, but do you think that that has any implications for the appetite of multi year plans in the state? I mean is there any read through there at all?","Ben Fowke","No. I mean, there is two ways to get a multi year, through settlement or through the Commission deciding and I don\u2019t think it really probably impacted very much Neil. ","As I said in my remarks, I mean we were obviously disappointed by not getting the interim rates and our interpretation of the Clean Air-Clean Jobs legislation certainly would indicate that we were very much eligible for it, but the Commission looked more to a historical precedent, which is a much tougher bar to meet. ","So, it\u2019s disappointing, but I think it\u2019s more of an anomaly given the accounting order. I mean, I still think we have a Commission there that wants to be constructive and understands that what we are trying to accomplish in Colorado is good for the state and good for our customers.","Scott Wilensky","Neil, just as a point of reference to you. During the hearings, the Commission at the end of it also indicated that they\u2019d like to see us work towards the multi year settlement if the parties were interested. So I mean, they clearly gave us the signal that they were open and thought it was a positive thing.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo","Okay thanks. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Teresa Madden.","Teresa Madden","Thank you for participating in our year-end earnings conference call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today.

Please note, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul A. Johnson","Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller.","This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss our strategic plans, update you on recent business developments and regulatory developments, discuss our 2014 and 2015 guidance, and our updated capital plan. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our web page. In addition, we will post a brief video on our website of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results.","As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'm going start by highlighting some of the key takeaways from the quarter, and then Teresa will provide more details on some of these items.","Overall, we had a solid quarter with ongoing earnings of $0.73 per share, compared with $0.77 per share last year. Weather was the biggest driver for the quarter, with an adverse impact of $0.07 per share. Based on our year-to-date performance, we're on track to achieve our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance, and we're tightening our range to $1.95 to $2.05 per share. In addition, we are positioned to meet our objective of limiting O&M increases to 2% to 3% for 2014.","We are also introducing our 2015 EPS guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, solidly within our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, as described in our earnings release including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings.","We're also providing you with our new 5-year capital plan, which totals $14.5 billion. Our updated capital forecast drives rate-based growth by about 4.7% using 2014 as the new base. So with 9 months of 2014 completed, we are on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. Beyond 2014, we are confident that our strategic plan will continue to grow EPS and our dividend at 4% to 6% annually. And that plan begins with a robust capital investment program coupled with an improving regulatory environment. Today, as you know, we're not currently earning our authorized ROEs. This is especially true in NSP-Minnesota and SPS. We believe we can close that gap over the next several years. To this end, we are formally introducing a goal of reducing overall regulatory lag by 50 basis points by 2018. In addition, we're establishing a goal of deriving 75% of our revenue from multi-year plans by 2017.","So in Minnesota, along with working to resolve the current rate case, we are collaborating with stakeholders on ideas for a longer term, more performance-based rate compact, and we're discussing alternatives to filing a 2016 rate case. And we're looking ahead to the legislative session when some of these ideas may surface. At SPS, we're working with stakeholders and planning to introduce legislation that would reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to make investments that will support the tremendous growth we're experiencing in the region.","We continue to make significant investments at SPS, and we are planning to file a Texas retail rate case in December of this year.","While constructive regulatory frameworks are important keys to our success, we also recognize that we need to diligently manage our cost. Our O&M objective is to keep our cost increases in line with expected sales growth. Now, this will be achieved by continued standardization and streamlining of our work processes. We made significant improvements in the last few years, and we're beginning to reap those results. We're also implementing new systems that will leverage and expand those results while also meeting both the challenge and the opportunity associated with transitioning a retiring workforce. Those efforts, combined with stabilization of nuclear and pension costs will position us well to limit O&M increases to 0% to 2% annually. I also believe we have some upside opportunity to expand our capital investments beyond the $14.5 billion we just announced. We have fantastic opportunities right in our backyard and I've challenged my team to pursue them.","Look for us to expand our regional presence in the disciplined and thoughtful manner you've come to expect from us. Our plans focus on transmission and natural gas. We have extensive experience in these areas and both offer the opportunity for placing assets under federal regulation. With respect to transmission, we've recently achieved milestones in the development of our transcos with the filing of our federal applications. At the same time, we are pursuing new projects through our operating companies in states that offer a right of first refusal or other favorable frameworks.","This 2-pronged strategy gives us the flexibility to pursue projects in a way that makes the most sense for the situation offering advantages as we compete for the right to construct under FERC Order 1000. While we're in the early days of pursuing growth in natural gas, we see great opportunities for new infrastructure and increased use of our existing assets. We have a solid track record in our natural gas business that we plan to leverage and expand. Look for us to build natural gas infrastructure in our regions and consider new upstream investments.","In addition, we are preparing to explore with our regulators the possibility of rate-basing natural gas reserves to take advantage of the current low prices for our customers, while also creating a new investment opportunity. So in addition to being on track for the year, we have plans in place to deliver solid earnings growth for the years ahead. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.","Teresa S. Madden","Thanks, Ben, and good morning. We're pleased to report another solid quarter with ongoing earnings of $0.73 per share, compared with 2013 third quarter earnings of $0.77 per share. The biggest driver of the difference was weather. 2013 third quarter results included a positive weather impact of about $0.05 per share, compared with cooler-than-normal weather in 2014 that resulted in a negative impact of $0.02 per share. Other drivers include improved electric and gas margins resulting from rate filings in several jurisdictions, as well as higher rider revenues. Partial offsets were higher property taxes and depreciation expense. These cost increases were expected and are consistent with our financial plans. Let me start by providing an update on sales in the economies in our local service territories. We continue to experience positive year-to-date sales trends with weather-normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.4% and firm natural gas sales up 4.8% through September. While the third quarter had some variations, year-to-date sales continued to exceed our original expectations for the year. Let me provide a little more detail on the sales growth by company.","Beginning with SPS, year-to-date weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 2.3%, driven by growth in the C&I class. Oil and Gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory. Sales at NSP-Wisconsin increased 3.3%, due to strength in the C&I sales that resulted from a large pipeline customer that has been operating at full capacity this year and continued growth in the sand mining industry. PSCo sales increased 1.3%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class resulting from a new food manufacturing company and growth in the energy sector. Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased 0.7%, driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and increased usage by the small C&I class. Economic conditions are generally stronger across the Xcel Energy region, compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our service territory of 3.7% remains well below the national average of 5.7%. In addition, the number of jobs in our region grew 2.3% year-to-date, compared with 1.9% for the nation. We are pleased with the better-than-expected sales growth but continue to maintain a relatively conservative forecast and are assuming electric weather-adjusted sales growth of about 1% for both 2014 and 2015.","Focusing more specifically on third quarter earnings. Ongoing electric margin increased $8 million for the quarter. Key drivers included: implementation of final and interim rates, which increased margin by $39 million; nonfuel riders increased margin by $13 million; and improved wholesale results increased margin by $7 million. These positive factors were partially offset by an unfavorable quarterly weather variance of $56 million as well as other items.","The electric margin results reflect an estimated reserve for the Minnesota rate case and an estimated customer refund liability, to capture the impact of sharing earnings above the authorized ROE at PSCo.","Turning to the natural gas side of the business. Margin increased by $8 million. This was largely due to revenue from our pipeline integrity rider, which is designed to recover our ongoing gas infrastructure investment. O&M expenses decreased $7 million or 1.2%, primarily driven by lower employee benefit costs and moderating nuclear costs. For the year, O&M is up 2.8% within our original guidance assumption of an increase of 2% to 3%. It is worth noting that O&M was highest in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to incremental spending on our system after a hot summer. As a result, we expect that our 2014 fourth quarter O&M will come in lower than last year.","More importantly, we're introducing 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2%, consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, other taxes increased about $13 million or 12%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. Next, I'll comment on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release.","Minnesota, we completed hearings for our electric rate case in August and successfully narrowed the differences on several key issues between the company and the Department of Commerce, the primary intervener. The important takeaway is that we continue to make progress and have limited the material remaining issues to ROE, certain labor and benefit expenses, as well as depreciation expense in 2015. As a result, we have revised our 2-year request to $248 million. The remaining key dates are the ALJ report due in late December, with deliberations and a commission decision scheduled for March of 2015.","We also completed hearings in the Monticello Prudence Review and believe that we presented a strong case focused on key things, including the investment was prudent, it was essential that the work be done right, and we made reasonable decisions during the course of the project. Importantly, the surrounding communities and our customers have a largely rebuilt, safe, and efficient source of carbon-free, low-cost power for many years to come. We look forward to the ALJ's order in late December with deliberations and a commission decision scheduled for March of next year. We remain confident that we will reach a constructive outcome in both the Minnesota rate case and the Monticello Prudence Review. In our Colorado electric rate case, we're seeking an increase in annual revenue of approximately $136 million or 4.8%. In addition, we have introduced a Clean Air-Clean Jobs investment rider that would cover 2016 and 2017. Our objective is to establish a multi-year regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. Key dates are staff and intervener testimony on November 7, rebuttal testimony on December 17, hearings in late January, and interim rates will be effective in mid-February with a final commission decision in the second quarter of 2015. In Texas, we reached a settlement, which will increase annual revenue by $37 million or 3.5%. The Texas commission is expected to rule on the settlement later this year. In Wisconsin, we reached an agreement with the commission staff that resolved all contested issues and provides for a revenue increase of $16 million. ROE, capital structure and rate base are not issues that were being considered in this case. We expect a final commission order by year end. It is still early in the South Dakota rate case process, and there is no news to report. However, we continue to anticipate resolution early next year. Finally, as we continue to invest in reliability and new infrastructure in our Colorado gas business, it is important that we recover these investments in a timely manner. As a result, we are planning to file a natural gas case early next year.","This morning, we are narrowing our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance to $1.95 to $2.05 per share and are introducing our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. It is worth noting that our 2015 guidance assumptions include sales growth of about 1% and O&M growth of 0% to 2%. In addition, we are introducing our refreshed 5-year capital base plan of $14.5 billion, an increase of $400 million from our last plan. Our capital forecast includes $4.5 billion for transmission investment, which has a high level of certainty. This base plan drives an overall rate base compound average growth rate of about 4.7% from 2014 to 2019. Our projected transmission investment drives rate-based growth of about 10% during this 5-year period. It is important to note, as Ben indicated, that our forecast doesn't include any potential incremental growth investments in natural gas assets and does not assume success in any competitive transmission RFPs that are expected to be issued over the next 5 years. On the financing front, we recently amended our credit facilities. While the basic terms and conditions didn't materially change, we extended the maturity until 2019 and increased the overall borrowing limits by $300 million to $2.75 billion. Looking forward, we are planning to issue $1.85 billion of debt in 2015. We have debt issuances planned for each operating company and at the holding company. The details are included in our earnings release. As a reminder, we don't plan to issue any equity beyond our DRIP and benefit plan through 2019.","Finally, we are pleased with the recently approved 10-year franchise agreement and the Clean Energy partnership with the city of Minneapolis. These agreements enhance our long-standing partnership with the city and demonstrate our commitment to environmental leadership by providing our customers with more options. With that, I'll wrap up my comments.","With 2014 coming to a close, we're pleased to narrow our guidance range and are on track to deliver earnings within our range for the 10th consecutive year. Our 2015 guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share is solidly within our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth objective and is supported by our $14.5 billion capital plan. We continue to experience better-than-expected sales growth with year-to-date weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.4% and weather-adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.8%. We are making progress on the regulatory front and expect to reach constructive outcomes in our major jurisdictions in the coming months. We continue to expect 2014 O&M expense to grow 2% to 3% and 2015 O&M to be flat to up to 2%, consistent with our original guidance assumptions. And finally, we are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend, 4% to 6% annually. So operator, with that, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ben, I just wanted to follow-up here, firstly on the oil and gas side, if you could expand a little bit. What service territories would this potentially include and how big of a program are we talking about? Just, if you can give us little bit of a sense here with the timeline and magnitude?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, it's really, we're -- this is Ben, Julien. We are focused in our footprint. As you know, we're on the periphery of the Dakotas in the Bakken, and we're well on the oil patch in New Mexico and Texas and, of course, there's the DJ in Colorado. So all of those have infrastructure needs. We're focused on the gas side, we're focused on the ability to work our existing assets, harder than we work them today and being more of a regional player. And as I said on the call, it's early days. So really what I've asked my team to do is just explore those possibilities, be more proactive, try to leverage our buying power. We buy about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of natural gas every year. So I think there's opportunities there, and we're going to look for them. None of that's in our forecast, as Teresa mentioned.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, absolutely. And then secondly, going back to Minnesota, if you don't mind, on the rate recovery potential, I mean, could you elaborate a little bit more on the timeline and ultimately what kinds of mechanisms you'd specifically be looking forward to improve the construct?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","You mean with the alternatives that we're talking about?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, exactly, just kind of lay out the timeline for each one, to what extent one might impact the other, just from an implementation time perspective?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I think they're wrapped around, moving to a longer multi-year compact, recognizing that the peak for our investment cycle is in 2015 and then it starts to -- the need for a rate release starts to levelize off. So the longer the rate pact -- compact, the more we can implement rate mitigation tools that would smooth that impact. So -- I mean that would be the focus along with discussing longer term with the commission, the overall policy goals that the state has, particularly on environmental side along with some opportunities that we have we believe that you could be more creative and drive value both for customers and reduce rates and also value for the shareholders. So -- and as you might know, Julien, there is work groups, the E21 work team for example, in Minnesota that are looking at the same thing. We've got these goals in the future, and our utility, Xcel Energy, needs to play a big part of that, and, of course, alternative regulation then is a natural byproduct of that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Absolutely. And then lastly, could you elaborate a little bit on logo [ph] trends and what we could see out of the IRP in, I suppose, early next year? I'm kind of thinking here about the decision with Black Dog to kind of kick that down the road a little bit? What's the thought process?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean, I think -- I mean the last thing you want to do is throw a party and nobody comes, right? So we're seeing an increase in sales, but, I mean, the fact of the matter is, if you look at plans for solar and other aspects of our business, you want to be careful about adding anymore generation to your system and we're just saying that needs to be pushed out, and we need to be thoughtful about it. And we're in good shape today. And so -- so Black Dog is still on the table as are the other programs, but increasingly it looks like it's further out in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. No real surprises out of the IRP in many regards?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","No. No real surprises. And of course, everybody, including us, is waiting for the final EPA rules to come out too, so there is a lot of things that are swirling around, and I think time is on our side to get clarity on those things.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ben or Teresa, I mean, putting the context, the 50-basis-point improvement challenge that you've given the team. Give us some context in terms of, as we stand here today, how big is the regulatory lag in your system and also remind us that 50-basis-point improvement would have equate to how much in terms of incremental earnings on an annual basis?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, sure. Ali, we generally are running at a 75 to 100 basis points in terms of the GAAP, and as you know that it varies by company. If we would achieve or assuming when we ultimately, because it is our target to achieve the 50 basis points, it could improve our earnings growth by about 75 to 80 basis points.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Because, as you point out, the target on the rate base is 4.7%. So to get higher or even to the higher end of your range, obviously, regulatory lag reduction has to be a key component mathematically to get there?","Teresa S. Madden","And that's exactly why we're focusing on that. So..","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Second question on load growth. If I look at the trend that you've reported to us for Xcel as a whole, weather-normalized, there's been actually a slowing down in the growth rate in each of the last 3 quarters, 2% in the first quarter, 1.4% and now 0.9%. Can you talk a little bit more about that in terms of what's happening to cause that load growth to slow down, as we've gone through the year?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, Ali, why don't I start and then Ben can jump in. I mean, early, if we focus first on '14, and we talked about this before early in the year, we had extreme cold weather, and we're concerned that early on in our weather-normalized growth that we potentially have still a little weather trapped in there. We all know that, that process of estimating is not perfect. If we look at this quarter in terms of the electric residential, it looks like we have declines in 3 of our 4 systems. If we go to last year, we had very hot weather when we picked up the $0.05, and we think potentially in that period we had some weather potentially trapped in our weather-normalized growth. So when we look at them period-over-period, we think that's partly driving those declines in the quarter. So long and the short of it, we're seeing some weather variations that we think could be causing this, but if we turn to our electric and commercial and industrial growth, we see that still as very solid across our system. And it's different reasons for each system.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Ali, I would just -- I think Teresa captured it, I mean I think you have to focus on year-to-date and year-to-date is ahead of our expectations. We're also seeing what we believe is household formation in both Minnesota and Colorado, and we saw customer growth of just under 1%. So I mean that's a really good trend in our minds. So again, I think, we're in good shape with sales. I mean, sales -- it's a different world, obviously, than where we would have been a decade ago, but good customer growth, good economies, diversified economies that all bodes well for the future, I believe.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then, Ben, your comment about focusing more on the gas side of the business and looking for growth there. Would that also include potential acquisitions of other LDCs out there that may be complementary to your system? Is that one of the strategies as well?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, we don't really comment on M&A and what I would tell you is that things are pretty pricy out there. So I think it's -- the team is going to focus on what I would call taking our organic presence, what we have, our growth, our customer needs and trying to make sure that we work those opportunities harder. And so, you're looking at pipelines, you're looking at storage, you're looking at what's happening in our region as coal plants retire and get closed and gas plants get built. Those are the kinds of opportunities that, I think, will drive value for us, Ali. And again, we're going to be very disciplined about it. I mean, we've got $14.5 billion of identified opportunities, so we can be pretty picky.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My last question, Ben, on the Minnesota rate case. When you look at where the differences currently lie between where you are and where the UC [ph] is right now, can you just quantify for us how much dollar terms are those differences and if you took ROE out of the equation, how much of a gap that would equate to?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think, we've narrowed the gap and, as Teresa mentioned, it's just in a few areas now that we've got differences in labor and pension and sales.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes, I mean, they're not significant. Right.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean I think it's important to recognize that while we have a sales difference that we've got a true-up mechanism, so it's pretty neutral.","Paul A. Johnson","And Ali, there is a schedule in the earnings release that details our position and the DOC position by line, so you can look through that.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I actually have just one question. So given the formulaic nature of your ROE in Minnesota and the fact that the rate case is still pending and that the 10-year treasury yield is again below 2.3%, are we risking yet another downward adjustment to the ROE?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, I think the testimony has all been filed. So I think the opportunities to reopen that are pretty limited, and I'm looking at my regulatory team, they're nodding their heads, yes. That is true.","Teresa S. Madden","So they're downward, really the 9.64.","Unknown Executive","And it's also been briefed. So we're pretty well down that schedule.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could discuss a little bit about how any kind of political changes next week might affect pending regulations, pending programs that you're looking at in several states. Just anything along those lines that might be material depending on outcomes in your 2 states?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","There's an election? There's an election happening next week? [indiscernible] In all seriousness, we've got some pretty tight elections, the race for governor in Colorado is pretty tight. If the Republican candidate wins, probably we could anticipate some changes to the commission. Nothing near term. The other thing that we will look for in Colorado is, it's possible that the Senate, which is now Democratic might go Republican. And if that happens, of course, you just -- any legislation that comes out would be more bi partisan. In Minnesota, I don't think it's too much of an election as far the governor's races goes, but it is possible that the House could go Republican, and again that would impact any kind of legislation that comes out again it will be more bi partisan in nature. Clearly, there's some big Senate races, particularly in Colorado. But by and large, I don't think you would see any immediate impacts. As you know, we -- I think we have got a great track record of working with both sides of the isle.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sure. Can you remind me what's the Colorado regulatory commission turnover or that relationship there with the governor that you mentioned?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Okay. Well, you mean -- there's 3 commissions. The governor gets to report those. Are you talking about Colorado, Travis?","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Colorado, yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. And so you have a Republican in Vod [ph] and then you have 2 Democrats. And I don't -- Dave or Scott, I don't think either of them are up for election and Vod, potentially has some confirmation issues but that would be about it.","Unknown Executive","Commissioner Powell would be the next commissioner up in '15.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","In '15?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess my first question is, if you take the 4.7% and the opportunities that are not included in that, what do you think the 4.7% could move to? Could it move up 100 basis points? Or just -- what type of incremental do you see as potential opportunity?","Teresa S. Madden","Paul, at this point, I think it's just early on. We are just starting to investigate and pursue these. So I think it would be premature for us to give a number at this point, but we clearly do think there is opportunity.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, there was a recent piece out by Moody's on rates. And, I guess, also in the AEP earnings call, they indicated that they had looked pretty hard at our REIT structure, and I think they elaborated a number of obstacles or problems that they found with the structure. Have you guys taken a look at REITs and come to any conclusions?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think, we're a little bit more early days on those sorts of things. We are interested in any structure that could be a win for customers and shareholders, but our focus right now is primarily on getting those transcos formed and making sure that we obtain rights to build the transmission that, that's in our region, either through the opco structure or transco structure. Where it goes from there is way early for us.","Teresa S. Madden","That's right. I mean, we would agree that REIT structure is complex and the first step is getting the transcos up, off the ground.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then my last question. You've talked about dividend growth of 4% to 6%, EPS growth of 4% to 6%. I think previously you talked about sort of a targeted shareholder return level of 10%. Is that 10% still part of your broad target?","Teresa S. Madden","That's been a while since we talked about the 10%, we just -- we, overall, think, we provide an attractive return to our shareholders. But it's been a while since we've been, probably about 18 months or even past on that about...","Unknown Executive","It's been a couple of years, Paul. I mean, obviously, if the stock prices moved up the dividend yield has declined, which makes it a little bit more difficult to get to a 10% total return based on 4% to 6% growth. So it's really more of a math situation.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little about the nature of deciding to pull forward some CapEx or at least increase CapEx in the near term in '15 and '16, in particular, and what was behind that? And then also, could you give us a little bit more granularity, if you could, on catching up on lag? You mentioned that the 50 basis points is your goal by 2018. But kind of how do we get from here to there? Is it lumpy? Is it consistent? What are we looking for?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Let me take the -- that second question. I will let Teresa address the first. I mean, the -- it's going to be more. It's not going to be next year. It takes time for these things to get traction. But you get the traction by having multi-year plans in place and we want to have all of our major jurisdictions with multi-year compacts in place and then disciplined cost control. And if you put those 2 together, and I think, we've got both of those in motion, then you're going to reduce regulatory lags significantly, and that's really what the plan is.","Teresa S. Madden","In terms of just variations in the near term, we have increased our estimates in terms of electric and distribution, investment spend, and some of that is really been driven by higher levels of new customer growth. So those are the primary variations.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up is on the Minnesota cases for next year. You have a $0.15 range in your EPS guidance. I understand that some of that range is going to be due to Minnesota, obviously. It's not just a point estimate that you have internally. Could you give us any kind of indication that would allow us to figure out the EPS change that's attributable to that alone?","Teresa S. Madden","[indiscernible] I think it'd be better to say, it's not just the Minnesota because Colorado we also have a pending case that's relatively large there. So between the 2 of them, that's creating the range. So I think we would just prefer to leave it at that for right now.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But the range is -- or the bulk of the range can be attributed to regulatory situations?","Teresa S. Madden","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question is who's worse, the Vikings or the Jets?","Unknown Executive","Oh, it has to be the Jets, for sure.","Unknown Executive","You will see that on December 7, by the way.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, we'll actually find out the answer to that question, won't we? The...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Greg, I wanted to tell you, I really enjoyed you morning joke, by the way.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The -- my question is on the dividend. I know that you raise the dividend above the long term 4% to 6% aspiration earlier this year. Your payout ratio is still below, what I would consider, the peer group average, although, obviously, you could slot different companies in and out of that. And your cash flow profile looks pretty good relative to the way you've portrayed it in your -- even in your updated release today. Is there still a possibility over the next several years that we might get one or more sort of out of trend line dividend increases as you try to move back to an industry average payout?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, I -- the objective is a long-term objective. So you can always have some lumpiness. And we recognize we have financial flexibility, Greg. But I really think when you do your modeling, you ought to just stick with what we're telling you and it's 4% to 6%.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes. I agree.","Operator","And next we'll go onto Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Your $14.5 billion does not include net gas reserves or FERC 1000 opportunity, correct?","Teresa S. Madden","That's correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what do you have in there as far as place holder for EPA regs yet to be determined?","Teresa S. Madden","We don't have -- I mean, in the left -- in the end of the period, we do have some dollars, but not for investment spend depending on how those rules come out.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. I mean, I think, that said, we've been working an environmental plan with our states. Clean Air, Clean Jobs is a great example of that. So we'd have been kind of planning for these regulations in our CapEx. Fundamental CapEx reflects the fact that we're moving to a more carbon-light world. In fact, as you know, we have reduced carbon from an '05 baseline by 30%, by 2020.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What's your annual net gas procurement? And what percent might you want to have locked in through reserves?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think, we -- between the LDC and the electric operations, it's somewhere around 400 BCF.","Teresa S. Madden","That's correct.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","So you can do the math on that. As far as what we would want to see, I mean, that's too early to tell. I mean, I think if you can smooth volatility, if you can lock in good pricing, if the commission get comfortable with the approach, we'll do as much as they would like to see us do, and we'll do as little as they want to see us to do as well. But I think, it's -- I think the pricing and timing is pretty opportunistic right now. So we want to definitely have those conversations.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Where are you in that conversation? Has it started yet or just very preliminary?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, we're beginning -- I would say preliminary would be -- is how I would categorize it.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One on Colorado. I'm struggling a little bit to understand the electric rate case process, really. In your electric rate case increase request, and meshing that with what's happening in the annual earnings test. Meaning you've given the $46 million refund obligation from the 2013 test and now you're recognizing an estimate or an accrual for $52 million. It almost seems that -- and maybe I'm misunderstanding it or maybe it's just due to something like what, abnormal weather, but it almost seems like you're earning a pretty good return there and even above authorized, according to these earnings tests. And yet, you're coming in and asking for a decent-sized rate increase to go along with that. Help me kind of true those up, if you don't mind.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I would. Teresa, help me out here. But there's 2 key drivers to why we are filing the rate case. It's the capital recovery of the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act and there's property taxes. So those are -- and part of that is, I think, a reversal of some things we've been deferring under the multi-year plan that we're under. So those are the 2 drivers, Michael. And if we can get those -- that recovery, then I think we can be positioned to do a settlement.","Teresa S. Madden","Right. I mean, Michael, when you think about the timing of the infrastructure build in Colorado, I mean, it's in the process of being completed, and it has to be done by 2017, so it's going in service. So therefore, we need the rate increase up to this point. We've have had AFUDC offsets, so that's causing the driver, and just as Ben indicated, along with property taxes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And speaking of property taxes, you talked about a very -- in your 2015 guidance, about a sizable increase, almost $80 million at the mid-point and property taxes. Where is the bulk of that happening? I mean, that's like a 15% year-over-year increase.","Teresa S. Madden","Well it's exactly what Ben was talking about in the -- 2012 through '14 settlements in Colorado. We had a mechanism where we deferred and then we were starting to amortize. But it's every year -- we start an amortization just 3 years, so the numbers have grown, and we're seeing a peak in that. So that, again, is driving that -- one of the drivers of that rate increase.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Along with just increased rate base and the associated taxes that go with that. So you get a -- it's a twofold-type thing.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it's not just -- I mean, Colorado has got the reversal of the amortization, but the other jurisdictions just kind of have a normal taxes of an income tax and property tax growth rate?","Teresa S. Madden","Right. Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And finally, in the Minnesota rate case, I mean, we're in late October right now, last to -- second to last day. How much -- if I remember correctly, so you asked for roughly $142 million for 2014. How much of that is already in rates? So if they give you the $140 million -- $142 million for 2014, what's the real step up versus what's actually in rates today?","Teresa S. Madden","What's in rates right now is we are collecting at the interim rate level, it's actually $127 million. So, I mean, we've gone through and assessed where we think we are at on the various issues and basically -- and set up some reserves related to that. But it's still early because we are not done with the case.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But if you get the $142 million, what it effectively means is it's a $15 million step up from what's currently, and effectively, the run rate you've had in revenues in Minnesota year-to-date?","Teresa S. Madden","I'm not sure I am quite following your question, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I can -- I'll follow-up with Paul offline.","Unknown Executive","I think -- Is he talking about the '15 step in? Well, anyway we'll follow-up.","Teresa S. Madden","Yes.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Okay. So...","Operator","And next we will move on to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","So I have a couple of questions. First on the 50 basis point ROE improvement that you're targeting. Is that something that we should consider as part of your 4% to 6% growth plan? And to achieve that? Or is that something that could allow you to do better?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I mean, as Teresa said it's 75 to 80 basis points. And -- so that's certainly is going to -- all things equal, would move us up, if you combine that with the rate base.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Right. And then the other target in terms of kind of the multi-year plan. Can you repeat, Ben, specifically what your objective there is? And when we think about Minnesota, just -- is this something that could be resolved within the context of the current case? Or is it -- you had mentioned something about legislation. So I'm trying to kind of understand like the timeline for -- I know we have a 2-year plan, potentially, in Minnesota, but it seemed like you were talking even more than that?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. I mean, I -- well, first of all, the goal would be to continue the multi-year approach in Colorado. Then in Minnesota, to work with the commission to go into a longer-term plan. We do believe we have some flexibility to go longer. And the legislative side of that, that I mentioned would be to provide the commission some additional support and guidance, and also take that broader approach to where the state wants to head as far as its own energy policy, so that -- does that give you some...","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","No, that's helpful. I guess, my question then would be, is that something that can be done in time by the legislature in context of this current pending case or something kind of later on?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, I think you could introduce it as part of the -- when the commission hears this current case. So it's not directly related, but it can be correlated, if you will.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, okay. And then just in the -- one thing that has been an improvement from when you laid out this plan last year is the -- I think you have a reduced amount of equity issuance?","Teresa S. Madden","Correct.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Than you had. So in the context of your 4% to 6% and the like, is that -- I mean, that -- maybe that just changed you within the range, but is there offsets to that, that are negatives that you still in the 4% to 6%? Or -- it didn't really seem to kind of change you within that range, I guess, is my question, so.","Teresa S. Madden","I mean, I would say, it keeps us within the range. I don't think there's necessarily offsets that you're suggesting.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I mean, as we -- look, we do everything we can to. We, obviously, want to be at the top of that range. And everything goes right. Of course, you can always be outside of it. But, as we all know, you always get thrown curve balls, too. So -- and we still have a little bit of dilution to our direct plans. That's pretty minor these days, but it's still there. So solid execution of all of these things we talked about, including the incremental caps spend and that would be icing on the cake. It would be certainly positive for our growth rate.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to -- I'm sorry, if I'm a little slow on this. But I'm not completely clear as to what -- I mean, you guys have been trying to reduce regulatory lag for some time. And what is it that makes you guys feel more confident about it? Is it because of the legislative efforts you might be making? Is it because you're getting better response in terms of people seeing things your way on the regulatory side? What is it, just if you could break it down? Or just, simply, what do you think it is that's going to be making this more successful in terms of the efforts you've already made?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Sure. Well, let's look at why we've had regulatory lag. I think that's probably a good place to start, and we've had a lot of capital spend as you know. And most of that spend has not been recovered through a multi-year compact. So that puts natural pressure on you. There has been a recession, sales have been flat, that's put pressure on you. We've had higher pension expenses as we worked off those market losses. And from an accounting perspective, that puts pressure on you. And so all of that has created lag. And then you look forward and you realize we have a multi-year compact in Colorado, we're hoping to renew that, we want to enter into a similar type of arrangement in Minnesota. You combine that with the fact that post '15, while we still have a good pipeline of opportunities, the acceleration smooths out, so the capital spend and associated recovery smooths out a bit. Our own internal efforts to manage cost and still achieve the reliability and safety goals we have through standardization, they are starting to take hold. So you combine what's happened in the past and then you look towards the future, when it looks like sales are rebounding as well. So you put all those factors together, and I think that puts us in pretty good shape. Perhaps not right away but within fairly short order to start closing that gap.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. That's very helpful. And then just to clarify a few things. The upstream rate based opportunities, when you think you might be able to tell us more about it? I know you guys are in preliminary discussions. When do you think we might learn more about how those discussions are going?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I really -- I'd love to give you a timeframe, but I would -- I don't have that because it's -- again, we are in early days. So as the opportunities arise and as the math pans out then we'll talk about it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And just to clarify, are you guys -- you guys are not interested in upstream non-rate based opportunities, is that right? Or, I mean -- or are you, perhaps have a...","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, it could be -- I'm sorry to cut you. It could be a FERC rate base. But we're not interested in merchant type.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","You're not interested in being an EP company?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Right.","Teresa S. Madden","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I just want to make sure. And then the RFPs in the FERC Order 1000. Again, when might be we hear more about what you guys might be involved in there? Any sense as to -- like just sort of a rough timeframe as to when we might hear more about that?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, the RFPs and STP are, I mean, they are going to issue them early next year. So we are anticipating a 90-day bid process. And then those who choose to participate they will be evaluated by the STP at that time. So mid to later next year.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. As you know the Integrated Transmission Plan 10 came out. It was about -- I think it was 40-odd projects about, roughly estimated $450 million. The next step will be the near-term plans that come out. And then what we anticipate, as Teresa mentioned, probably later in '15 is another Integrated Transmission plan 10-year look, which would incorporate some of the considerations under the 111(d) rules. I think that's what the timeframe is.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","I just wanted to get a little bit sense -- when at mid-point, if I'm right -- when we started off this year it was, like, 197, 198 and the mid-point, if I am right, is around 2.7, 2.8, which is, like, $0.10 increase, if I'm doing my math correct, around 5% increase in EPS. But then when I look up your last slide where you gave us the rate base, which was at the Wolfe conference, the rate base for '15 was estimated at 22.4. For '14, was at 20.7. So that was like nearly an 8%, 8.2% increase in rate base. It was the strongest rate base growth in the horizon of the 5-year forecast. So what I'm trying to equate is, what is happening that we're losing -- if rate base numbers are still correct and they haven't changed, why is the 8.2% increase in rate base, '15 versus '14, getting diluted to 5% increase in EPS during the 2 years?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, Ashar, I would say our rate base growth-- I mean, it is moderating because we're coming through some major spend. I mean, our nuclear spend is essentially completed. So we're expecting it to moderate back, so you're seeing some of that -- of the past rate base growth. But as we look forward, we talked about what we would anticipate going forward, which would align with our earnings growth that we're talking about.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","I would say we'd probably -- it would have to go through a lot of the timing expectations and everything else, but...","Teresa S. Madden","Exactly.","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Probably be better to do that offline.","Unknown Executive","Well, and, plus, Ashar, it does reflect the timing of rate cases and what we request in rate cases. Clearly, in Minnesota, we've got a step increase for 2015, but doesn't cover all the capital that's being spent. So things like that are what drive that, we think we've issued 2015 guidance that is realistic for us and that's what we've put out there.","Ashar Khan","Okay. I'll try come offline and try discuss it. Because I just thought it was -- when you have a higher rate base growth and you have equity needs, you have kind of toned down since the last time I just don't understand why the growth rate is not higher in '15 versus '14, in commensurate to the rate base?","Unknown Executive","We will talk about it offline.","Operator","We will take our question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors","Andrew Levi","I guess, most questions have been asked. I guess, I mean, if you get to the top end of the your range, though, then just back on an assurance question, and then you're kind of close to that kind of that growth rate 2015. But anyway -- just on the 4% to 6%. It just seems, I guess, with all the things that have occurred, whether it's lack of issuing shares and all the other things that you've outlined over the last several months, including today, would it be fair to say that you're a lot more confident about being able to achieve the top end of your range over the next few years?","Teresa S. Madden","I mean, Andy, we have a range and we are within the range, and we're confident we'll achieve within the range.","Andrew Levi","But no difference of being able to be more confident on the top end?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Well, we are going to do everything to be on the top end, but, I mean, I think, Teresa said it, and I mean, we're keeping with the 4% to 6% growth from both the dividend and EPS.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just had -- want to make sure I understand your -- the impact of the lag reduction. If you start with the ballpark 10% ROE and you reduce lag by 50 basis points, that's 5% improvement. So is that 75 to base -- 75 to 80 basis points just that compounding over 5 years to get to 5%. Is that the right way to look at it?","Teresa S. Madden","Well, maybe. I mean, if we start, I wouldn't start with that 10%. I would start with -- the regulated utilities are earning more around 9% at that level. So I think that would change your math, just your starting point, which would follow -- would fall out from that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So the 75 to 80 is potentially incremental to the 4% to 6%? Or gets you firmly within the 4% to 6% and then, by year 5, you've probably maxed out the opportunity?","Teresa S. Madden","We would be close, assuming whatever our authorized are -- we are holding our authorized at the same level right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to inquire what your major states are doing or what you're doing with the regulators and legislators there on the response to 111(d)? Are you working closely with them to propose responses? Can you give us any sense of -- obviously, it's early in the process but any sense of where things might be headed and, in particular, the possible impact on your operations?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes, I mean, we're definitely working close with our -- all of our stakeholders in all of our key states and our goal -- and our senators and our governors are very much on board with this is that-- as was mentioned in the preamble 111(d) Xcel Energy's model utility on how things get done, achieving environmental objectives and keeping costs affordable for consumers, but we are disappointed that we're not getting the credit we believe we deserve for the early action that we have taken. So [indiscernible] But we are disciplined that we're not getting the credit we believe we deserve for the early action that we've taken. So there is lobbying on their end, we are lobbying through the industry groups, we are doing out reach ourselves with the EPA, and we are going to work as hard as we can to get the final rules shaped in a way that I think is more equitable to those companies and those states that have been out front and moving towards where the EPA wants to take us. So very much engaged all the way down the line.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And do you have any clarity at this point on the potential for shutting down some of the coal plants, et cetera, in addition to the ones that are, obviously, previous EPA rules have impacted?","Benjamin G. S. Fowke","Yes. I mean, I think you really got to wait for the final rules. As you know, the EPA came out with, what is it, a notice of data availability yesterday or the day before. That suggest -- that maybe there's some of the interim targets the 2020 targets maybe there's a glide path there, maybe there's some flexibility on the base [indiscernible]. But not much more clarity than that.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just one clarification, Ben or Teresa. The 4% to 6% EPS growth, let's say, over the next 5 years, does that continue to assume a 1% growth in weather normalized electric sales? Or do you have a different growth number going forward?","Teresa S. Madden","No. That's basically what we're assuming.
