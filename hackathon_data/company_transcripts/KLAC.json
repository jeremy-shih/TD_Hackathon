My name is Candice, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter fiscal year 2013 conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please begin your call.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2012. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy.","A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results.","More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. We're pleased with the company's performance in the December quarter, with bookings, revenue and EPS results for Q2 coming in at the upper end or above the range of guidance and marking 2012 as another year of market leadership, differentiated financial performance and high stockholder returns for KLA-Tencor.","New orders in the December quarter were $760 million, an increase of 50% compared with the September quarter, with strong foundry and logic demand. Second quarter revenue was $673 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 per share. For calendar year 2012, KLA-Tencor delivered revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.23. In calendar 2012, we also returned $521 million to stockholders in the form of stock repurchases or dividends. Our dividend payments of $250 million in calendar year 2012 reflect the July 2012 increase in the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share.","Turning now to our view of the current business environment. Consumer demand for mobility continues to be the primary force behind semiconductor industry demand, with strong unit growth in the mobility markets, competition and increased cost and complexity fueling our markets today. For KLA-Tencor, the Q2 bookings profile featured another period of strong foundry demand, with foundry customers accounting for 2\/3 of the new orders in the period.","The foundry markets are being driven by mobility. And though current industry projections are for foundry spendings to be flat to slightly down in 2013, the market leader in foundry is forecasting an increase in CapEx for the year, and overall foundry investment remains at a high level. The sustained high level of foundry investment we have experienced in this cycle is favorable to KLA-Tencor and a key contributor to our strong relative performance, as foundries tend to be the highest adopters of process control.","Logic was 16% of bookings in December. The logic markets are in a period of transition as growth in mobility markets crowds out the traditional PC markets. We believe the demand for logic customers should strengthen in the first half of the year, reflecting the important role process control plays in improving yields and driving device innovation at the leading edge.","Finally, orders from memory customers grew to 17% of total orders in December. We anticipate higher memory bookings in March, but we do not expect memory demand to improve meaningfully until the second half of calendar year 2013. The driving force behind KLA-Tencor's market leadership continues to be our focus on the customer. As our customers execute their investment strategies at the leading edge, each successive generation of new technology is characterized by increased process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirements. Process control is on the critical path to successful management of these complex, technical challenges. And as the market leader, KLA-Tencor is positioned to continue to benefit from strong relative adoption of inspection and measurement technologies as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology road maps.","Now for some perspective on our broader outlook for industry CapEx for calendar 2013. As we look ahead to 2013, even though global economic and political uncertainties and cyclical factors present a headwind for growth, we believe the industry demand environment has stabilized, and we see 2013 setting up to be another period of high capital intensity and featuring relatively high foundry and logic investments as a percentage of the total. Our current yield is for the overall industry CapEx to be down in the range of 5% to 10% in calendar 2013, with industry order levels stabilizing in the first half of the year and demand momentum building in the second half of the year. Against that backdrop, we believe KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to continue to benefit from demand trends that have been favorable to the adoption in our core process control markets and help to strengthen our market leadership.","Turning now to guidance for the March quarter. Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $700 million to $850 million. March quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $690 million to $750 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.76 to $0.96, assuming an effective tax rate of 18% in the March quarter to account for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers. Mark?","Mark P. Dentinger","Good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges in credits and any cost of credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There is no difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS because excluded pretax expenses, which increased EPS by $0.02 after taxes, were offset by a $0.02 per share discrete tax item. Balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I mention GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available on our website.","Q2 new orders were $750 million, up sharply from $506 million in Q1, and Q2 net orders were $740 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 33% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 43% in September quarter; Europe was 1% of new systems orders, down from 13% in Q1; Japan was 7%, down from 13% last quarter; Korea was 13%, down from 20% last quarter; Taiwan was 39%, up from 7% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 7%, up from 4% in Q1.","The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 48% compared with 51% last quarter; reticle inspection was 10%, up from 1% last quarter; metrology was 19%, up from 15% in the prior quarter; our non-semi businesses were 3%, down from 4% last quarter; and service was 20% in new orders in Q2, down from 29% last quarter.","Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 67% of new systems orders in Q2 were from foundry customers compared with 54% in Q1; logic customers were 16% of new orders in Q2, down from 30% in Q1; and memory orders were 17% in Q2 versus 16% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect new orders for fiscal Q3 will be within a range of $700 million to $850 million.","In Q2, we shipped $673 million versus $686 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $690 million and $750 million in Q3. Total backlog at the end of Q2 increased by $65 million from September 30, and we ended the quarter with almost $1.1 billion systems backlog. The backlog at December 31, 2012 included $252 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $837 million of systems orders that have not yet shipped.","Total revenue for Q2 was $673 million, down 7% from $721 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q2 was $523 million, and services revenue was $150 million, which is a record for KT. Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $690 million and $750 million.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.1% this quarter, down from 56.6% last quarter. The largest contributors to the quarter-over-quarter decline in gross margin percentage were an increase in inventory reserves associated with several product transitions and the continuing modification of our product -- production and service inventory management processes to keep pace with our customers' rapidly changing requirements. For Q3, we are expecting gross margins between 55.5% and 56.5%.","Operating expenses were $214 million in Q2, slightly higher than the $211 million in Q1. Most of the increase in operating expenses was due to higher research and development expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were roughly flat with Q1. We expect operating expenses in Q3 to be up between $2 million and $6 million from Q2.","OIE was a net $8.4 million expense in Q2, down about $1.6 million from Q1. Most of the quarter-over-quarter decline in net OIE expense was due to a gain on the sale of a nonoperating investment. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense between $9 million and $10 million in Q3.","In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $43 million or 29% of pretax income versus a 24% rate in Q1. The Q2 rate increase was largely a function of a change in the estimated distribution of earnings between our U.S. and international locations. We anticipate our rate will decline significantly in Q3, following the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in January. And our best estimate for the non-GAAP tax rate for the fiscal year is about 24%.","Non-GAAP net income was $106 million or $0.63 per share in Q2. Using our standard 24% tax rate, our Q2 EPS would have been $0.67. At the revenue range I previously mentioned in defining our planning tax rate of 24%, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.70 and $0.90 per share. At the lower tax rate we are expecting for Q3, our EPS range will be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.96.","Weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q2 was 169.1 million versus 169.8 million in Q1. During Q2, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.5 million shares. In November, our board approved an additional 8 million shares for our repurchase program. And as of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 8.4 million shares available under our current authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about 168 million for Q3. We also paid $67 million in dividends in Q2. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in Q3.","On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, about even with September 30, 2012. Cash generated from operations was $77 million in Q2 compared with $245 million in Q1. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $606 million, up from $537 million at the end of September. DSOs were 82 days at December 31 versus 68 days at September 30. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factorings. Net inventories were down $27 million from Q1 and ended the quarter at $663 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 1.8 turns in Q2 versus 1.9 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $17 million in Q2, down from $20 million in Q1. Total headcount at December 31, 2012 was 5,816, essentially flat with September 30. We expect our headcount to remain about flat in Q3.","In summary, our guidance for Q3 is new orders between $700 million and $850 million, total revenue between $690 million and $750 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.70 and $0.90 per share applying a 24% tax rate and between $0.76 and $0.96 per share using our anticipated Q3 tax rate.","This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open the call up to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So Candice, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of them. First off, I think previously, Rick, you were saying that you thought CapEx will be down, closer to 10%, and now you're thinking around 5% to 10%. What segments of the 3, between logic, foundry and memory, has improved the most? And in this environment of down 5% to 10%, what do you think about the outlook for KLA in 2013?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, we did see some strengthening recently. Primarily, it looks like foundry is a little bit better than we felt when we had talked about the down 10% to 15% based on some recent news that we've seen. What that means for KLA-Tencor is positive because we do all in foundry and the needs for process control are only increasing as the transition happens to 20-nanometer, which is what's going on in 2013. So we anticipate that we will outperform the industry this year, as we have in the last couple, based on the increasing intensity of process control, plus the mix of customers.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. On gross margins, it was a little light for December related to your guidance and given your -- what came in at the higher end for revenues. I understand the quarter-to-quarter variation, but could you help us go through the effect of the product mix, customer distribution and competition related to your gross margins?","Mark P. Dentinger","Yes, Satya, this is Mark. It has less to do with the customer distribution than it simply had to do -- we are going through a pretty active period of product transitions right now, and we built up the inventories somewhat purposely to accommodate that. And when we do, do that, you do get some excess and -- excess demand outcome as a result of that, and we had to take some reserves. Now historically, we tended to get some of those back, but that does take a little bit of time to come back through the system. And we do expect it will digest these and then return to a more normal level in the next quarter or 2.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citibank.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question is related to general foundry activity. In terms of the strengthening that you've seen, has that been in the form of pull-ins by customers? Or has it been just an inflation and overall forecast?","Richard P. Wallace","Terence, yes, it's Rick. I think that it's associated with 2 things. One is, I think there is more broad demand, so it's not simply with one customer. We're seeing some strength in others as well. And we do see 20-nanometer. I think the understanding of the challenges associated with 20-nanometer are playing it out. So we believe it's likely that they'll be a differential investment in process control as a result. So I think it's both factors at work.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the follow-up is to take that a little bit further. When you look at the 20-nanometer node, including 16 or 14 variations, more looking at it planar versus FinFET, is there any way to help us understand what perhaps the requirement increase would be moving to FinFET from planar?","Richard P. Wallace","It's a great question. Unfortunately, it's a rather complicated answer. I think it depends upon a couple of factors. One is, if the companies that are moving forward, in general, have an experience in 3D, then their process control perhaps is better understood and they might be a little less intensive than others that haven't. But we see, in general, increased demand in metrology as one area certainly where 3D drives demand, especially in product lines such as our optical CD and our films measurement tools. We also see a different kind of defectivity concern, which drives adoption, in our case, at the very high-end brightfield inspectors, which is necessary as people are trying to deal with the aspect ratios and the defectivity. We haven't really quantified exactly how much is the increase between 28 and 20. We already see some of the demand. We'd say that probably 1\/3 of our orders today are associated for 20 or below. So we're already seeing that start to play out, but we think it will accelerate through the rest of the calendar year as people look at adding more capacity for the 20-nanometer node. Beyond 20, the question of 16 or 14, depending on how you define it, we think there's still investigation as to what's going to be needed, and we're working very closely with customers on that.","Operator","And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, first question, Rick, you talked about stabilization of orders in the first half and a pickup in the second half. And I'm just curious, you identified memory as a place that would pick up. But also, I would love to hear your thoughts on how you see foundry trending into the second half, as well as given that large budget we heard from a company down the road from you, how we should see that playing through the model as we exit the year.","Richard P. Wallace","Sure, C.J. I think that when we looked forward, we actually saw some increase -- slight increase. And memory, actually, as a percent of our whole, went up a little bit in the December quarter, and we're anticipating that to continue to grow as a percentage of our total. So we'll see some memory pick up even in March but more pronounced in the second half, and we think that's driven more by technology investment and some capacity in NAND as we get to the second half. Logic, pretty steady in the last couple of quarters. I shouldn't say steady, I should say lumpy but kind of a steady average run rate. We see it at about 25%, 26% for the March quarter and then continue investment through the year. Foundry, actually, we anticipate coming off as a percent, and more in the 50% to 52% range is what we're snapping right now when we look ahead, which is down from the 67% we did. As we go through the year, foundry, I think, is somewhat dependent on overall what happens with 20-nanometer and how many players are really in -- and expanding that. We know there are some activity and some customers, but how that broadens out and the timing of that will influence, I think, whether it's flat or slightly down for the year. We do see some memory strength in logic, I think, pretty steady, maybe some increase in logic, but again, we'll have to see how the year progresses.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, on the foundry side, Morris [ph] spoke to you, 20-nanometer being a bigger node than 28. And I think there's some confusion as to whether he was talking revenues or clearly wafer prices are much higher or wafer starts. We'd love to get your thoughts on what that kind of node could be like relative to 28 and whether you would include within that the 16- or 20-nanometer FinFET.","Richard P. Wallace","Right. I think it's a big question right now. I think from many of the established guys, they're trying to figure out if they are going to lean in to 20 heavily or if they're going to wait for 16 or 14, depending on what they see as end-demand. I think the other challenge that people have is what the manufacturability is of 20 and how the prices come down. There's certainly a lot of interest. I think that the initial skepticism about the number of customers has reduced. Frankly, I think there's more interest than there was. As far as whether it ends up being bigger than 28, I'm really not in a great position to answer that. I do know that from a process complexity standpoint, there's certainly a lot of concern about the number of processes that are changing, and that's what's driving a lot of our business. But I don't think we're in the best position to answer the actual magnitude of the capacity. I think it depends on a lot of factors. But we certainly see a lot of challenges associated with getting the process under control both from a defectivity standpoint and a process -- overall process control from metrology. So with all the changes with APL, 3D structures and the general scaling challenges, it should be a robust environment for process control and for KLA-Tencor.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First of all, a cycle question. You guys have been very clear on the cyclical outlook, but the one thing I'm just trying to figure out for modeling purposes. [indiscernible], obviously, you have a very robust CapEx budget. They said of their stated budget, 2\/3 of it was first half-loaded and then 1\/3 second half. But they certainly held out the possibility that things would pick up in the back half of the year if they did some more for Apple. Incorporated in your guidance for the year in terms of that pickup in the back half, does that assume TSM is coming down on the back half or foundry TSM in particular? Does that assume kind of the more robust budget that they have or maybe the more conservative budget? In other words, is there upside to your forecast if they do wind up spending a little more relative to their commentary around what they would do for Apple?","Richard P. Wallace","We're not anticipating anything beyond what they've said publicly, which is a slight increase. I think they've stated 6% up for their CapEx. So the target mostly, the anticipated, what I've heard them talk publicly about is that, that will be first half, more loaded toward the first half. But I think as we all know, the foundries actually review their CapEx investment strategy more frequently than annually for sure in this environment. So I think it's very hard for us to speculate because our customers don't actually know what they're going to end up doing. We do know that the change, the volatility, the upside of all these great foundry business has been that there's good business for KLA-Tencor and we continue to perform very well in this market. The challenge is that as a result of the volatility and the lack of ability to really forecast, we end up, as a result, having to be more responsive, which impacts some of the things like we've talked already around inventory and our flexibility in operations to support it. But I can't really tell what they're going to do because I think, frankly, our customers are nimble and respond to the market as it plays out. Our overall thesis though is we'll continue to outperform the market, and the general consensus we're getting is a better outlook than we had a few weeks ago even and probably in the range of flat to down 5 right now.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. Very helpful. If I could for my follow-up ask, AMAT is once again kind of refocusing on process diagnostics, and this is something that's been around for several decades in terms of them trying to come in and compete with you in this segment. Obviously, they have some new actors that are doing it this time, but they've tried to do this before and it hasn't worked. Do you have any incremental concerns about their ability to penetrate even a little bit of share in this market when you so successfully defended that position so many times over the years?","Richard P. Wallace","I don't underestimate any competitor, and I think it's true that AMAT's got a renewed focus in general. It has caused us, I think -- we take note of all competitors. And certainly, we're in a very attractive space, and people are going to try to penetrate. So we're increasing our level of investment, and I'd say that we are very focused on satisfying our customers. And our strategy is to play our own game and play it -- take it to the next level and respond to customers and continue to invest in our road map. But I absolutely take seriously all competitors and have a lot of respect for the guys over there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rick, I had a question in terms of metrology. When you look at moving down the technology curve from 28 to 20, is that a trend of the metrology going more in line, especially for the critical steps like lithography where chipmakers are beginning to put it in foundry tools rather than ex situ or you don't see any trends like that?","Richard P. Wallace","Oh, I think there are certain cases where it makes sense to have metrology integrated. I think it ends up actually being a question of process control. And when there's a high-enough variation, then you want to reduce the lag time from the measurement to the correctables. And for a long time, for example, some basic measurements have been made in situ, in places like film thickness and CMP for many years. The question is, can you make the measurements that you need to make and get the feedback quick enough? And is it cost-effective? And do you need to make that frequent of a measurement, depending on how the variation is going? But I certainly think people are always looking for ways to improve their process control, and integrated has always been an idea that people have had. It's interesting because I don't think it's truly in situ. In situ would imply that it's actually in the environment. So the real -- there's only a couple of in-situ measurements that happened, and those tend to happen in chambers or in environments. These are tools that are actually linked to the process equipment themselves, whether it's to the -- often in the case of litho, it'd be linked to the tracks. And so I do think that there are opportunities there, and it's always a question of cost effectiveness against the perceived need, against the impact of reliability and uptime. But it's certainly an area where people have been exploring for a number of years. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's more interest, especially as the design rules create more need for more and more control.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, your memory orders moved up in December, and you're saying it's going to move up further in March. Is it all -- the driver coming from NAND? And if so, what is the breakdown of NAND and DRAM?","Richard P. Wallace","A lot of drivers, NAND, but actually, in the December quarter, it was about 50-50. So we did see some investment associated and primarily in technology-related. And I think for a long time, the memory guys, especially DRAM, have been somewhat on hold regarding investments, and now we're seeing some catch-up. There is an outlook that has NAND increasing and maybe even adding capacity later in the year. Our forecast, for what it's worth, for the March quarter is that it bumps up a little bit higher to 60% of the total memory forecasts. So still not back to levels in the past but certainly off of what was a very low number just a few quarters ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Rick, I had a question about equipment reuse since this has been a theme as of late, and how you're seeing that play out in terms of how it affects process control maybe versus other equipment types?","Richard P. Wallace","By reuse, you mean extending technology nodes with equipment?","Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. It varies. I think it depends on product capability, process change and the availability of tools. I would say that by and large, we do not see a lot of reuse happening, and we actually have set up and offer to sell, even refurbish some of our older equipment. But in the leading edge, the reuse tends to happen in process areas that are not as sensitive, in fact, often not even key inspection or measurement points. So therefore, it doesn't really lend itself because our tools tend to be utilized pretty -- people are very careful about where they implement them, and they tend to implement them on the processes that have the least amount of margin, which is not where reuse happens. So even though years ago we set up a business to support it, it's actually not been extremely active us -- either for us or anyone else because on the leading edge, the things people are pushing are things that need metrology and inspection. So it hasn't impacted KLA-Tencor, and I think it may be another reason why process control will continue to increase as a percent of the overall spend, as people try to leverage the assets that they have.","Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then my follow-up question was tied to your gross margin. It's come down a bit. You mentioned that some new products coming out, some inventory buildup affecting it. But has there been a meaningful shift in your equipment shipments lately that have affected that? And what would you need to kind of get those back to the high-50s range?","Mark P. Dentinger","No, there's been no meaningful shift in the equipment mix. This is Mark. Basically, what we're experiencing right now is that we're getting clipped a little bit on excess demand issues, largely in conjunction with building up the inventories to be more responsive to the customer circumstances and to manage the supply lines. And we do believe that, that is, at least -- let's call it a 1-, 2-quarter phenomenon and then it should resettle back into more normal levels. We also are responding the same issue a little bit on our service side as the distribution in the multiyear migration towards the foundries has reallocating balances into the service inventory levels as well. So those 2 phenomena, I think, are underway. It's just a question of how long that -- if you will, that transition is going to be with us. But in terms of just the raw margin, in terms of the -- on the product sales, that does not appear to be a factor.","Operator","And your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up question, Rick, on the 2013 industry CapEx you use. So have you accounted for the higher CapEx spend by this leading logic customer in your new view? Or is there still possible upside as you kind of sort things out with that customer? Then I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace","So, again, we're not -- I don't think we're the best people to forecast this because we're going largely on what's being said publicly. But in order for us to get to a flat or down 5 kind of range, we are accounting for what's been publicly stated. Now we also think that, that's going to change based on history. So yes, it accounts for increases on the 2 major players and the decrease in the other player.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on that same topic. Can you share maybe some of your updated thoughts on the timing of KLA's 450-millimeter R&D investment since that same logic customer says it is setting aside a significant amount of CapEx this year or next year for facilities?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. Yes, we've already shipped 450 tools, and we continue to do that. We're shipping primarily to equipment manufacturers. And so some of the first tools that went out for that were -- are bare wafer particle inspection tools. We're actually seeing some demand for other equipment or services that we offer for 450. We have wafers that we make smart wafers that are used in that, in our sensory division that we're seeing some demand for as well. So we are already supporting the equipment world for their preparation for 450. And we will have a rollout over time of the additional equipment as we phase in the next-generation. We're not retrofitting any existing tools. What we're doing is, when we introduce new models in the road map going forward, they have 450 capability in them, by and large, is how we're going to satisfy it. So we believe we're well-aligned to the latest industry thinking on timing. I'll also point out that in the past, the initial entry of 450 or any wafer size change was well in advance of any production. So the challenge, I think, the industry has is satisfying pilot needs, followed often several years later by the time you get to full production.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, just wanted to understand how I should think about the 20-nanometer capital intensity for process control. Is it a 40% increase that some of the foundry customers have been talking about? Or is it more or less for you guys?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think it depends on how you quantify the overall investment. I wouldn't want to say that our business is going to go 40% up as a result of the same silicon capability, maybe the same die out but if you take into account shrinks. We are seeing additional points. I think what's important to understand is, the way our customers figure this out is they'll go through pilot, which they're doing, and they'll try to map out where they need, what kind of capability. And that's kind of an ongoing characterization process. And then they will -- as they're ramping, tune that, depending on what they discover in terms of how much process control they actually have over the process, both inspection and metrology, so we anticipate that the transition to 20 has similar characteristics to the transition from 45 or 40 down to 28 in terms of the challenges, the number of process steps, the number of critical layers and, therefore, we think in similar increase in intensity as we go forward. All that being said, I think in the end, that's how we derive the increased performance of process control in KLA-Tencor versus the rest of the capital budgets that people are -- the different sectors inside of WFE.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Appreciate that. And just one other question on the OpEx front. I mean, your OpEx is going to go up a little bit. How should we think about the trajectory for OpEx for the rest of the year?","Mark P. Dentinger","This is Mark. I think you're going to see OpEx basically in the range of 215 to 220 for the rest of the year. We won't be aggressively adding headcount at this point, but you do get some lumpiness as a result of material bias and whatnot in the R&D lab. So I think that's not a bad range to think about, but again, we'll update you quarterly if things change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I had a -- just a clarification. When you said flat to down 5%, was that for the industry or was that for KLA in 2013?","Richard P. Wallace","That was for KLA as a measure against a 5% to 10% down for the industry.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I was wondering if you have any updated view on e-Beam inspection and review on your competitor. And Taiwan has been very vocal about how optical inspection will reach limits or barriers at sort of the 10-nanometer node. So I was just wondering if you have any updated view on the e-Beam market.","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think e-Beam is essential, I think that -- particularly for a review. I think that the ability to be able to see the defects that you're catching, you can catch defects without resolving them, but it's very hard to take corrective action without better insight into what the defects are, which is why the primary application for e-Beam is in review. Inspection offers some advanced capability but has their limitations. So we offer inspection as well and have for quite a number of years, trying to meet the needs in some niche places. The challenge for e-Beam inspection, much like the challenge, frankly, for e-Beam and lithography, is throughput and the ability to target the e-Beams to get them effectively, to get enough down onto a wafer and return so that you can image them and determine the defectivity leaves you at least 100x gap versus optical. And we don't see anything that's going to limit capability of optical inspection at 10-nanometer below. It will continue to get more challenging and expensive as it has. But inspection -- optical inspection tends to lag lithography by -- I think of it as 1 to 2 generations. So you can envision, if you're doing EUV-like lithography, you can optically inspect that with what is essentially 200-nanometer, sub 200-nanometer optical inspection, so you don't have to be at the wavelength. e-Beam has, as I said, some attributes that are highly valuable, but it has many challenges, not just throughput but also associated with the kind of nuisance effects that the e-Beams create and the charging. So we do have active programs. We believe there is a role for it. We've been investing in for a long time. I just don't see it replacing optical as the core technology for inspection.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, you're sounding a little bit more positive on memory, definitely, compared to the last call. And -- but your CapEx number has not gone up significantly. Could you give us a little bit more color on what your thoughts are on NAND and DRAM? Are they -- year-over-year, are they up? And what's the driving -- what's driving the spending?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. I don't see them being year-over-year up. Actually, when we're modeling it, we have them flat to slightly down but second half-loaded, primarily associated with DRAM capacity that comes on, depending on what you anticipate for results. We actually have seen some positive momentum in our space. But overall, for CapEx, we're not modeling memory up, in fact, slightly down or flattish, if you will. And I think that the benefit from some of the recent integration of some of the M&A out there was we have customers that are out now making investments in advanced inspection capabilities in order to enable them to do technology migration. So that's where we're seeing a benefit.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And the follow-up is on reticle inspection. So we saw the bottom in the order in the last quarter and we see some pickup. But where are we in that particular cycle? And what will drive the acceleration to the last peak on the reticle inspection?","Richard P. Wallace","I think reticle is going to be lumpy going forward. I don't think there's -- that there is not a huge demand being created at the leading edge based upon the work that's going on in double patterning. And there is a lot of high-end capability that's been served already. So we have basically done a great job of penetrating the leading edge with our leading technology. So most of the activity tends to be more in the fab lines for recall, which is not a big -- as big a market and is something that, of course, we're focused on. But I don't think I'll provide the same size that we saw when we were launching and introducing the 6xx. Compensating for that is the increased opportunity in process control around multi-patterning. So the corresponding decline overall in the reticle is made up by increases and opportunities in overlay. So I think that on balance, it ends up actually looking pretty comparable but a shift of products based on the technology. When it will come back is when we see or if we see advanced EUV really take off, then there'll be a lot of opportunity in reticle again. But right now, that seems to be further in the future than it was just a few months ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Rick, two questions. First, how should we think about your products -- product mix as spending pattern changes given the foundry and logic spend much more compared to last year?","Richard P. Wallace","Not really very different from last year in terms of overall products mix for us. I mean, we are seeing that, basically, if you look at overall CapEx, you could have different models. But let's say you say down 5%, foundry is flattish to down 10%, logic is probably flattish. So the impact to us is that not a lot changes in the customer mix or the kind of process controls being utilized, except for the more advanced process control because we're a further along in the technology road map a year later.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just on a follow-up. How would you characterize at least on a qualitative basis the 20-nanometer ramp versus the prior 2 nodes in terms of achieving acceptable yields? I'm just trying to understand the duration of the yield ramp versus the prior 2 nodes.","Richard P. Wallace","I think our customers are focused on accelerating faster. They certainly get a lot of competitive pressure in the market. They recognized -- certainly, the fabless companies have recognized that first to market wins. So when I talk to our customers about it, they're expecting and planning to ramp faster than they did on 28. And I think most of the customers recognize the challenges that they faced in 28. So that's why I think we're seeing increased interest in process control on KLA-Tencor equipment to facilitate that. But every technology node, our customers say that they want to ramp faster, but this one is coming on the heels of what was pretty challenging for many ramp. So I think that there's increased heightened sensitivity to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, given the limited capacity buys on the memory side today, where's the focus been, I guess, on the technology buys in terms of memory? Are you seeing more orders in terms of 3D NAND flash? What's driving it, I guess, in the near term?","Richard P. Wallace","There's certainly development going on around 3D, as you know, and I think there's -- that creates opportunity for us. There's definitely interest, in general, in pushing patterning further, but I think the NAND guys are struggling a bit with that. So we're seeing overall increased focus on supporting technology migration, and that is certainly driven, I'd say, right now in NAND by the 3D work, although we don't expect to see production for that until probably late in this year.","[Audio Gap]","Unknown Analyst","So, Rick, I have a question regarding your logic versus your foundry customer regarding what kind of option you get from these guys. So the foundry customer typically have a lot more different type of chips going for the lines. Do you see that as a result of that? Do you think that the foundry customer have a greater opportunity? And anyway you can kind of quantify it, for example, on a node-to-node basis or maybe the logic guy is the only one who know ahead. Is the opportunity similar? Is it 10% more or 20% more? Any way you can help us with that?","Richard P. Wallace","Pretty similar. I mean, I think that it depends. There are different logic manufacturers. Obviously, they are market leaders in that. But by and large, the question of high mix versus low mix is -- does have an impact, but often, it's offset by the people who have lower mix tend to be pushing technology perhaps a little bit harder. So that kind of counterbalances it. And I think in the end, there's probably more variation across different companies than there is across -- for example, foundry to logic is probably -- if you looked at all the data and didn't know if it was foundry or logic in terms of how people adopt and what their strategy is, you'd see actually more variation in the foundry space per se than you would just by going -- jumping between foundry and logic. Does that make sense?","Unknown Analyst","Okay. All right. I think I get what you were saying. A follow-up question also on the NAND side. I think yesterday, SanDisk talked about it, one, why node started to see increased capital intensity and, therefore, they have to spend more. Do you think you guys benefit from that, 1y versus 1x, or the kind of very leading edge on the NAND side?","Richard P. Wallace","I think that there is definitely challenges that create different opportunities for us. And so we often talk internally. If we can solve our critical customer problems that creates opportunity for us, return for them, so any time there's a shift in technology, it creates opportunities. And often, it obsoletes existing capability, although we'll try to reapply whatever we can. But certainly, as people go in the y-dimension, one of the biggest challenges they have is, especially when there are many, many process steps that are in a closed environment, it pushes things like qualifying the tools very hard, which interestingly plays to our bare wafer capability because you wouldn't necessarily think it. But it's a way to qualify tools so that making sure that they are not contaminating at all as they're going through these multiple steps. It also creates opportunities for people looking for defects with optical tools and then trying to figure out what they are with review tools. So it helps us in that regard. So we do see opportunities, and it does cause us to have to modify some of the technology, which means new tool sets in order to do that often, or pushing, as I said in the bare wafer case, pushing existing capability even harder.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","On the December orders that you came in above your guidance, and you had a pretty wide range of guidance, was that entirely due to foundry? And if so, was that more 28- or 20-nanometer-focused?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, given that foundry was 2\/3 of our orders, then obviously, foundry was a big player in terms of how the bookings came out. We've widened the range of guidance often because there is a customer concentration. So you never quite know if deals are going to happen, when they're going to happen. But the foundry space, as we said, about 1\/3 of our business in foundry is around the 20-nanometer work and the rest is 28. So I'd say that foundry was the larger influence. But there was stuff that came in at the end of the quarter, which we were not expecting, which is how we ended up above the range of guidance for bookings. And that was actually across the board. We saw some memory business come in that we didn't anticipate, we saw some logic come in and we saw some foundry. So it was generally strengthening at the end of the year, which I take to be a very good sign.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I have one follow-up. At SEMICON, you had a graph that showed a die-size impact for mobility products at the different node changes, pretty big increasing die size. Are your customers expecting the same thing between 28- and 20-nanometer for the same number of cores?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, there's certainly -- I mean, part of the reason to go to 20 is to not have the die size go up. So you have your choice of either increasing the functionality on the same size or actually reducing it. But the only point was that what's been fascinating about mobility is the notion that people would be -- have good enough performance and stop innovating, and we've definitely seen that, that's not the case. So as people go to 20, they're definitely going to push very hard on shrinking. The question is, will they then add multiple cores or will they expand to get more performance? And I think certainly, in some cases, that's going to be the case. And then you also have graphic dies, for example, that try to use these larger die as they can to provide the most functionality. So we're seeing both, but I'd say that it's a similar phenomenon to what we saw in microprocessors in the '90s, where die not only got more complex but got larger over time.","Operator","And our last question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick one on ASML and metrology. So they even talked about this on their last call, but they're beginning to use closed-loop metrology to help improve their litho process window, especially as the double patterning becomes more prevalent. And it sounds adjacent or maybe even complementary to stand-alone KLA tools, but I'm wondering if there's anything here we need to watch relative to metrology and how it's used for litho and if there are any emerging opportunities or risks for KLA.","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think that there are definitely reasons for people to try to increase the capability in overlay, and certainly, the idea of having more functionality closer to the process can make sense. What we're seeing right now is that the overlay market has expanded quite a bit. I do think customers are going to try to pursue alternatives to get their process under control, first and foremost, and then to manage their costs. So we always anticipate any change like that to be one that could potentially displace us unless we continue to add more value and create more capability for our customers. And so we take it seriously, we take any alternative approach seriously and it drives us to create more capability in our products and continue to innovate and continue to invest in them. So we're the leaders in overlay. We think we've got a great position to build upon. But we certainly look at the opportunity associated with the challenges of process control to also be a potential disruptor, and we've got to continue to make investments and support our customers to optimize our position.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Would there be an opportunity to actually integrate into a litho tool? Or is that something that's more or less off-limits?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, it wouldn't be a litho tool, it'd be a track. The integration doesn't really happen on litho because you have to have developed -- people have tried to do latent image measurement. It's just very hard to do and has been unsuccessful in the past. So the opportunity actually happens in the track. And yes, there is an opportunity to do that. But they're integrated and we've been looking at integrated for many, many years. And there are some advantages and then there are some challenges. The real question is, is the rate of change fast enough to warrant dedicating one tool per one track, which is what it would take? And there are customers that are experimenting with that, but there are those that have concluded that, that's not the best way to go. But we're certainly in close conversations with the people that are interested in that capability to provide that if that's the path they choose to go down.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.","In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us. I plan to briefly cover three items in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick review of KLA-Tencor's outstanding results in the March quarter, followed by highlights of our very strong market performance in 2017 as reported by Gartner, and concluding with our updated growth outlook for the industry and for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2018.","Let's begin with the March quarter highlights. I'm very happy to report another record quarter for KLA-Tencor, with revenue topping $1 billion for the first time in March and finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.02. These results were driven by our ongoing focus on customer success and technology leadership and reflect the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace across each of our major product groups and in services.","Also, on March 19 we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Orbotech, Limited. This acquisition is the next chapter in the progression of KLA-Tencor strategies for profitable growth and long-term value creation. With this combination, KLA-Tencor will be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions and services, extending our reach to address even more of the electronics value chain from semiconductor device manufacturing to packaging, printed circuit board and flat panel display manufacturing.","We have kicked off the integration planning and regulatory review efforts, and these processes are moving forward as planned. We are very impressed with the Orbotech team and are excited about the opportunities that this combination will create as we execute our strategies to benefit customers, stockholders and employees. Coupled with the momentum we are experiencing in our core inspection and measurement business, and with the prospect of augmenting that growth with the new assets from Orbotech, we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for KLA-Tencor.","Turning now to highlights of the recently published Gartner market report for 2017. The data shows that in a very strong year for wafer fab equipment investment and with memory customers accounting for approximately 65% of overall WFE demand in 2017, KLA-Tencor grew or maintained a strong market position and drove SAM expansion in each of our major product markets, while addressing increasingly more complex inspection and measurement requirements in the marketplace.","With WFE forecasted to remain at a high level in 2018, we expect overall process control intensity to grow in the year, driven by growing value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems and semiconductor industry expansion in China. As a leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to strengthen our position in China, both in terms of customer footprint and adoption.","We are still on the early stages of a multiyear investment cycle in China which represents a tremendous opportunity for KLA-Tencor. The presence of subscale factories under tremendous pressure to yield while still in start-up mode and the overall complexity associated with developing a world-class semiconductor industry will drive significant growth for our business in the region.","In addition, the high level of investment by memory customers has driven an unprecedented investment cycle in unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology to support capacity growth in wafer manufacturers and IC fabs, as well as to meet more stringent wafer cleanliness and wafer flatness specifications in vertical NAND. These products experienced record demand in 2017 with order momentum continuing in 2018 and with shipments and revenue expected to scale in this calendar year and into 2019.","Now for some product highlights that underlie our strong market performance. First, we saw particular strength in mask inspection in 2017. Gartner estimates that the mask inspection market grew 64% in the year to $538 million, fueled in large part by customer investment in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography.","KLA-Tencor's mask inspection technologies are critical to customer success in bringing EUV to market. We are collaborating with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development, yield and requalification. Other process control challenges inherent to EUV include resist qualification and scanner control. These, along with the complex patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV source technology, present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive process control portfolio in the semiconductor industry.","EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor. The overlay metrology market grew 29% in 2017 to $456 million. KLA-Tencor is a pioneer in overlay metrology, deploying unique capability across two different technology platforms. The growth of memory investment in 2017 was a major factor in the strength in overlay metrology and in other metrology markets for KLA-Tencor in the year, driven by the increased complexity in advanced memory design architecture, including multiple layers and film stacks and verticalization of structures.","Finally, in optical pattern wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor's largest served market, the SAM grew 6% in the year to over $1.3 billion. And we experienced our strong market leadership driven by customer preference for our broadband plasma and laser scattering optical inspection portfolio over competing wafer inspection technologies including e-beam.","These are just a few of the product successes that led to our sales growth and SAM expansion in 2017. This growth is a result of the continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address increasing inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive customer success in a period of strong growth for the semiconductor industry.","Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2018. Coming off an exceptionally strong year in 2017, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today is solid, supporting a WFE industry growth outlook that is currently expected to be in the high-single digits to low-double digits in 2018. In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory once again comprising 70% or more of WFE investment in 2018, led by the ongoing ramp in 3D NAND, capacity expansion in DRAM and continued investment from China memory.","In foundry, we are expecting to see orders for the first wave of investment in five nanometers to begin in the second half of the year, with logic investment in 2018 focused on 10 nanometer. And finally, we expect continued expansion of EUV lithography investment in foundry and DRAM in the year. Given our technology leadership, strong customer acceptance of new products, improving process control intensity and leading edge memory and our strength in China, KLA-Tencor is expecting to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2018. This does not include any contribution from the Orbotech acquisition which we expect to close by the end of the year.","I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented an outstanding period of financial performance for the company. Shipment, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue and earnings per share finishing at record levels. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives.","Revenue was $1.021 billion in the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.02. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now turning to highlights of the March demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.019 billion, finishing at the top end of the guided range for the quarter, with upside driven by higher-than-expected customer pull for our overlay metrology products. Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion. Based on our current build plans and expected customer delivery timing, we continue to expect second half shipments to grow in the mid-single digits compared to the first half of the calendar year. For the full year, we expect shipment growth in the high-single digits.","Memory was 78% of shipments and stronger than our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 47% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the June quarter with memory shipments forecasted to be approximately 68% of the total in Q2. Memory mix is expected to remain between 60% and 70% of shipments in the second half of 2018. Foundry was 13% of shipments in March, and foundry is forecasted to be about 24% of shipments in June. Logic was 9% of shipments in the March quarter, and our current outlook is for logic to be 8% of total systems shipments next quarter.","In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 45%; patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 22%; and non-semi was approximately 4%.","I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.021 billion in March, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Service revenue was a contributor to the upside in the quarter as customer utilization at the installed base remains at a high level. We expect revenue to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.08 billion in the June quarter, and for revenue in the second half of calendar 2018 to be in accordance with our outlook for full year revenue growth of 10% or greater.","Gross margin was 64%, in line with our guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance were consistent with recent margin trends in terms of product mix, efficient execution of new product introduction and variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations. Looking forward to June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65% as a richer product mix is expected in the quarter. Our gross margin guidance of 63% to 64% in calendar 2018 remains unchanged, however, current trends support a bias towards the high end of this range.","Total operating expenses were $261 million in March, down about $2 million compared with December, and operating margin was 38.5%. Operating expenses for the March quarter were approximately $5 million higher than guidance due to a number of factors, including higher material cost for next-generation programs.","We continue to see many opportunities for future top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and vertical memory applications. For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $262 million to $264 million. In the second half of 2018, we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $265 million to $270 million per quarter, with variability around this operating expense level driven by the timing of non-head count engineering program development costs.","Our outlook is for operating margin in 2018 to be in excess of 38.5%, consistent with our published business model in the $4.2 billion to $4.5 million annualized revenue range. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter, in line with our guidance and our long-term planning rate Finally, net income for the March quarter was a record $318 million and we had $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","I'll turn now to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.89 billion, an increase of approximately $132 million compared with December. Cash from operations was $353 million in March and free cash flow was $338 million. In Q1, we paid an aggregate of $92 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $85 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.","In February, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.75 per share. That's effective this quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had $1 billion authorized under our new share repurchase program, as well as authorization for an additional $1 billion contingent upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. We plan to resume share repurchases in the June quarter consistent with our previously articulated approach. We expect the amount of share repurchases in the June quarter will be limited given legal restrictions following the distribution of the proxy statement and prospectus in connection with the Orbotech shareholder vote on the merger. Our current plan is to accelerate our share repurchase activity following the completion of the shareholder vote subject to market conditions.","Finally, I'll note that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. We will be adopting ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. We will provide additional information on the impact of the new standard on KLA-Tencor's financial reporting in our next earnings call in July.","In conclusion, the results demonstrated by the company in the March quarter and in the 2017 Gartner report reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' growth strategies, and the value of our industry-leading business model and capital allocation strategies. We are experiencing unprecedented growth in the electronics industry today, driven by new demand drivers such as artificial intelligence, big data, automotive and the Internet of Things layered on top of the traditional computing and mobility markets.","This is a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors. As the market leader in semiconductor process control and with the new opportunities presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and to create long-term enduring value.","Looking forward to 2018 and beyond, we are energized by what lies ahead. Fueled by record total backlog of just under $1.9 billion as of the end of the March quarter, we are positioned for revenue growth of 10% or more in the year against the backdrop of the overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow in the high-single digit to low-double digit range.","With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is shipments in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion, revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $2 to $2.24 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.02 to $2.26 per share.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have today's call. Feel free to re-queue for additional questions as time permits.","All right, Jeff, we're ready for the first.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Hi. Hi, guys. So the first question obviously is on memory. I don't ever remember you guys shipping 65%, 70%, which is basically in line with the market. I don't ever remember you guys having memory concentration that's sort of in line with the market. Typically it's quite a bit lower. So I guess my question is, is it like a one-time deal related to China? Is it a big uptick in memory process control intensity? Can you just talk about that? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Hey, Tim. I'll take it and then give it to Bren. Yes and yes. I mean, I think China definitely helps because of the greenfield fabs, which are always great for process control intensity, but also newer players needing to get the capability to ramp. The second part is that we have new capability which the market is recognizing the need for, and so we're seeing increased process control adoption as a result of that. And that's both in the developments in NAND, but also in DRAM as they continue to push design rules.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Hey, Tim. Welcome back. So I don't have much more to add. I mean, to Rick's point, I mean, China, we did ship pretty significantly into DRAM project in China. We're going to ship into a NAND project this quarter so we see a lot of momentum there.","I think from a metrology perspective and inspection perspective, we're seeing some solid adoption in both segments, NAND a little bit stronger than DRAM from a process control intensity perspective. So we're really, I think, excited about our positioning there, and we've got some products in the pipeline that hopefully will help drive intensity further.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Bren, can you \u2013 I guess, just as a follow-up, can you talk about the timing on those products? I know sort of the industry's been waiting for a product that can really help ramp yields in 3D NAND. You guys have been developing that product suite for now sometime, can you talk about when that's going to really shift and when that's going to become meaningful in terms of revenue, and that could really drive the sort of organic memory process control intensity up for you? Thanks.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. And I mean on the inspection side, the inspection problem is proving \u2013 it's a difficult challenge for customers and proving to be a pretty challenging engineering problem. We've got some tools out in the field, we're working with customers in evaluation phase. We'll see if that translates into a high-volume production product or not. I think the jury is still out, but we're doing a lot of work on that front. And I think that's one area.","I think on the other area is a product in metrology where we've shipped a couple of probe tools into the field for in-stack metrology and so we're hopeful we'll get some traction there. I don't think these products contribute to the financial results we've been discussing or the outlook over the next six to nine months. But certainly as we move into 2019, we'll see \u2013 hopefully we'll get some traction there and we'll see those will be a bigger percent of the total.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our second question comes from the line of Mr. Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarterly execution. We just got off the Intel call and they just pushed out their 10-nanometer ramp to the yield issues. We've also heard of yield challenges by some of your memory customers, especially on the DRAM side. You guys have always characterized your flagship Gen 5 wafer inspection platform as more of an opportunity as EUV starts to get more proliferation. But just given all of the current yield challenges in logic and memory, have you guys seen some pull-ins of the GEN 5 adoption into calendar 2018 by your customer base?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","We have had good success with the GEN 5. I think we are still in the mode of proving out the capability before it ramps into production. We do have a couple of places where we're seeing multiple units ramping. But it is a relatively long cycle. We have seen the pull-in of product nodes. So in the case where we did think it'd be more tied to EUV, we've seen more work characterization of existing nodes kind of to the problems that you're talking about. I think people felt like maybe they'd resolved some of the yield challenges are definitely using some of their initial capability to debug. So we are seeing some opportunity for that. But it's still \u2013 it's kind of as we expected. It's a relatively long adoption cycle once people get in the evaluation. And most of the customers are encouraged but continuing to push that.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","So Harlan, by the end of this year, we will have either shipped or booked for dollars somewhere near 18 to 20 systems into the field across all segments, and I think that's one of the things that we're encouraged by that we are solving issues in development across all segments with the customers around discovery use cases but also EUV use cases. So most of the roadmap for that product line right now is about how do you prepare for volume production for 5 nanometer and beyond. And most of the engineering effort on that tool is to speed up throughput and work through tunable sensitivity and some of the other opportunities to make it more production viable. So the traction is good. It's demonstrating value and it's demonstrating value across all segments which we're encouraged with.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then according to some of those recent market share statistics that you were talking about, Bren, your reticle inspection business grew by over 2x in 2017. Obviously, it's the highest profitability segment for you guys. Early EUV adoption, I think, was probably one of the strong drivers for the 2017 performance. But as we think about accelerated EUV adoption this year, do you guys think that the reticle inspection business can grow this year off of the strong results last year? First question. And then can you guys just give us an update on your next-generation EUV e-beam reticle inspection platform? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. Let me take it. Maybe to view it from a portfolio perspective, we did see strength as you mentioned and we talked about in the prepared remarks due to a number of new tapeouts at advanced design rules and this, of course, being driven largely by people pushing designs and mask shock capability for EUV but not only that. Yes, we do see continued strength overall in support of EUV. And when we look at our overall process control intensity for EUV as compared to optical, if you look at the one scanner of optical Deep UV versus EUV, you need a similar percentage, maybe a little bit more percentage of process control intensity to support that. That includes the fractional use of reticle tools as well as wafer tools in order to support it.","So while the overall industry in general may see capital intensity decline in areas other than litho, process control will track and maybe even outpace litho for process control intensity for EUV. So we're encouraged by that. In terms of e-beam, we're finding that there is a lot of appetite for the optical extensions that we have on the platform, and so we continue to support our customers with that. One of the nodes of the \u2013 the comments of the slipping out of nodes due to yield means they're also delaying advanced EUV insertion, which gives the optical a longer runway. So we feel very well-positioned to support that.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Hey, Harlan. This is Bren. The only thing I'll add to that is that we had talked about introducing that tool in the marketplace sometime in calendar 2019. Our views on that haven't changed. I would expect that it's more towards the end of 2019 than the first half. But our plans are moving forward and it's going to intersect the HVM at the right time. So nothing really new to add on that front since what we updated you with last quarter.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the great set of results. Rick, my first question is in regards to the foundry shipments. It's a two-part question, basically. First, when I look at the foundry shipments, they are pretty much at an all-time low. And I just want to ask how is the trajectory from here. It seems like even in the back half, it's not going up nearly to the level that you have seen historically.","And second, as you talked about EUV, when I look at the EUV shipments that ASML is having in the foundry segment, it seems pretty strong recently but I don't see that reflected in the foundry shipments that you are having. So is there a difference in timing in terms of when the EUV ships and when you would actually start to benefit?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, I'll take it, but I'll also have Bren comment as well. In support of EUV, the question we're just addressing \u2013 we have seen reticle, so I think the reticle timing of that is maybe more consistent with the shipments of EUV tools and that is support of the same development work that's going on.","We do expect to see an increase toward the end of the year in activity around the ordering for 5 nanometer node, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I think that that is coming and that's something that we'll see later. And to your point, we had a great quarter but it wasn't really driven by our foundry business and we expect that to be late 2018 and carry over into 2019.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. I mean, to the point it's \u2013 we're performing, I think, at a pretty high level here with a lot of unique inflections that are driving our business absent the strong foundry of logic environment. And I think as we move through this year stays during memory centric, but beyond that we would expect foundry to coming a little bit stronger. To your point it's at the very low level, almost historical low level.","But when you look at the comments we made earlier around China, you look at the EUV development activity, you look at the activity we see in the wafer space and then this improving process control relevance in and around the different memory segments, it's a good story for us this year and I think as we move into the future with stronger foundry environment then we'll see that kick in. And as you know, the process control intensity and foundry logic tends to be closer to 2x what it is in memory. So not every dollar of WFE is created equal when it comes to our business, and so certainly if you see a pickup in that segment so that's a significant positive for us.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And then my second question is in regards to the mask inspection and broadly the strength that you saw last year. I wanted to understand how much of it is just driven by increasing mix towards ASICs. In cloud, we are seeing more and more companies moving to application-specific processes. So what I wanted to get a sense of is that as the foundry mix moves from low mix (31:55), which is a limited number of designs starting in the fab to a high mix in an environment where there are a lot more designs running in the fab, how does that affect your business?","And secondly, as we think about the mask inspection business, the strong growth that you saw last year, was it a one-time phenomenon, or as the ASICs strength continues in the future, could this be a higher growth business for you?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, it certainly scales with the tapeouts, right? And you could even have a situation where you see reticle capacity put in place where you don't necessarily see it coincide with wafer starts because you have to do the tapeouts but maybe the volumes into the low-volume design. So clearly, we're seeing more activity there, certainly even at 7-nanometer. And so you're seeing more investment in and around reticles with a 7-nanometer width with the multi-patterning schemes that are being deployed. It does drive a need for reticle capacity around writers and inspectors, and if there's a nice ratio of one to two units to \u2013 or one inspector to every two to three writers in a mask shop. So that's certainly a driver for us, and we think that as we move through the end of this year and into next year, I think that there's momentum around that that continues.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. That's all I have.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, if you look at the Gartner data you said earlier, process control grew at roughly half the rate of WFE. And obviously, that make sense given how much the spend is driven by memory. Curious what the scenario you would see where process control would outgrow WFE. And do you think that that's something we could see over the next 6, 12, 18, 24 months? And if so, what would be the precise drivers there?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. C.J., great question. I think if we just held firm, in other words if the mix didn't move as much toward memory and if you held memory as a ratio to foundry logic was the same in a year where it was flat, then of course we believe process control intensity would grow.","Even though process control intensity did go up in memory, as Bren mentioned and as you all know, it can't make up for the mix shift that we saw. So I'd say that would be the main way of process control intensity because a growing memory market on a relative basis but on a process control intensity that goes down if you do a weighted average.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","I mean, we've looked at it, C.J. I mean, a rule of thumb is usually for about a 10-point swing in mix you end up with 70 or 80 basis point shift in intensity. So it tends to move around a little bit depending on who's buying and so on, but that's a reasonable way to think about it. So to Rick's point, certainly we start to see foundry logic as a percent of total increase, and that will be good for process control intensity. And we've seen it at closer to the 50% range and 50% to 60% \u2013 50% foundry or so in that ballpark is when we've seen process control outperform. To Rick's point, I think as you move into an EUV environment, certainly if the process control may be scaling with litho, that certainly maybe adds a different element to the ability for process control to grow online.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","That's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, are you guys disclosing bookings backlog anymore? No?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","We do in our 10-K. If I give you the backlog and the shipment, then that sort of gets you to the bookings number. But I will tell you that we were slightly below a book-to-bill of 1 this quarter.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then one quick follow-on. As you think about the transaction with Orbotech, what are the restrictions on your ability to buy back shares between now and close?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a small window that I have this quarter or prior to \u2013 from the opening of our quiet period to the filing of the prospectus and the S-4. So it's a very small window where we will begin our activity but it'll be limited.","So then we have no restrictions \u2013 so we're restricted at that point and then we have no restriction after the shareholder vote has occurred. So based on current schedules and those could move around, based on comments from the SEC and so on if you get those, but that would imply that we would begin buying back in a more significant way sometime in the second half of next quarter, of the September quarter.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. You may go ahead.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in terms of the capital intensity trends you're seeing in the memory market as a whole. Obviously 3D NAND has helped a lot of your metrology business, but DRAM has also picked up in terms of spending for both 2018 and may carry into 2019. I know your inspection business benefits from the more multi-patterning steps, but are there other areas or other applications as DRAM continues to shrink that also benefit, I guess, both process control intensity and for you specifically?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes. For DRAM, we do see a push for more capability for inspection, both the high-speed kind of inspection that we do in monitoring, which is laser scanning based but also in development, which is GEN 5 oriented and the leading edge. We also see overlay challenges in DRAM are very significant, and it drives our metrology business for overlay. And so yes, there is an increasing trend. 3D NAND has probably had more growth and on a relative basis than DRAM, but we do see increasing trends in DRAM as well.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question going back to China for a second. I think last quarter you talked about the Chinese foundry segment being a area, one, of growth, but also that's probably the area first where you're seeing a pickup. It seems like this call has kind of shifted a bit to the memory side of things. Is the Chinese foundry markets still tracking as you thought and it's just being supplemented now by the memory market?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","I think that the Chinese foundry market has slowed a little bit and we're seeing some delays there whereas the Chinese memory market continues to move forward the investment and they're dealing with all the things you'd expect from bringing greenfield fabs up in terms of challenges with getting facilities ready and tools installed. But we do see strength in the memory. As Bren said, we'll see more of that. It has been a little bit softer on the foundry side, though.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Just on the mix from an order perspective, and there's some lead time to these orders because of the site construction. But order profile in calendar 2018 is probably closer to 50\/50. So the order profile in 2017 was heavier memory, and those are the tools that are shipping. So from a shipment perspective, it's more memory-centric. But the orders, which will start \u2013 will come through and will ship into next year have a more of an equal weight to them.","Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. I guess on your foundry business, how should we think about the breadth of your business as the industry approaches 7 nanometer-plus and then 5 nanometer? Should we expect something similar to 28 where you had multiple customers investing pretty aggressively, or a fairly consolidated customer mix there?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","We haven't really seen dropout happen for many players as we're going to 7 nanometer, so I'd say the same people that were in, I think they're phased in terms of their investment. There aren't that many players doing the advanced design rules for foundry but they're all still in and we expect them at various phases to be investing. So no real change in breadth from the foundries on the advanced nodes.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. And then as my follow-up, I think last quarter you guys talked about domestic China orders tripling in 2017. Curious what your expectations are for 2018, if any? Thank you.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see a continuation of the momentum there just given where they are in terms of the early innings with some of these investments. I would say the numbers look relatively flat to us from an order perspective my lead time comment earlier notwithstanding. So we'll see how it plays through as they move through the quarter. Obviously, there's some second-half dependency to that profile but for right now it looks like it's fairly consistent versus what we saw last year.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Yes. Thank you. And I apologize I also have a question about foundry. I guess your major foundry customers, my impression is they generate a meaningful portion of the revenues from the mobile market. And that market is pretty subdued across the board. And so the question is can we see a sustained recovery in your foundry business as smartphone demand remains weak? Because seeing foundry revenues even for June down a healthy double-digit percentage, it just doesn't seem like the node transitions are enough.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, we're pretty down in foundry. So I mean, I think our profile is consistent with that. And we don't anticipate a lot of strength in foundry until we get later into the end of the year and into 2019. So all our commentary and all our forecasting agrees with your thesis that there's a point here. We are seeing increased activities, however, around advanced node and investment and that's, of course, the precursor to more investment that's coming.","So we're definitely seeing it and some of the reticle business that we're seeing now is in support of that. So given historical patterns, the same path is being followed where you have the initial investment around the development followed by a ramp. The size of those ramps may be smaller than in the past, and that's part of what we anticipate and model as we talk about our business going forward.","Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Great. Thanks, Bren.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. You may go ahead.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the quarter. Rick, you were a keynote speaker at recent SEMICON China. I'm sure you got a chance to talk to some of the executives driving the China 2025 plan. How do you expect domestic Chinese spending to behave in the face of the recent trade tariffs and the tensions between U.S. and China? And then I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Right. I don't think anything's changed from the perspective of the Chinese in terms of what we've seen in terms of some of the discussions. This is a program to gain self-sufficiency in memory and in logic over time because China's such a big importer of semiconductors. So I don't think there's any change. I thought you were going to ask me what does it sound like? And we take their numbers and cut them in half and we still have a big growth forecast for China based on the investment level that we're seeing and the activity that's going on there. But I don't see any change as a result of any of the recent noise in the system around trade.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up on the Orbotech deal, I'm curious what kind of feedback have you received from your three big customers on this deal? And Bren, if you can just talk about the regulatory milestones required on this deal? Does it require China MOFCOM approval and some of the other approvals? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","I'll take the first part and Bren could take the second. There's really been very little commentary from customers. This is such a different deal that even in the case where the larger customers are focused on some of them have interest in both areas, they're not in the same organization so there's not much overlap. I think the one thing that our customers have said consistently is they don't want us to lose focus on what we're doing for them and we're not. Structurally, we're going to organize in such a way that we will maintain every bit as much focus as we have today supporting our existing customers. But that has been the only commentary we've heard at all is please continue to support us but there was no assumption by them, that we wouldn't. They just \u2013 when they felt compelled to voice something, that was it.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","And then on the regulatory front, I mean, by the end of this week we will have had all of our filings submitted which is our plan and according to schedule. There's one that will take another week or so, and that's not for any reason other than that there's a holiday in that country that's delaying the submission given the clock that exists on the review period. So everything moving according to plan.","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Jeff, our next question?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. You may go ahead.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a quick follow-up on the Orbotech deal as well. So with kind of this trade tension with China and U.S., do you see that potentially creates some challenges for you guys to get the regulatory approval from MOFCOM?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","We don't. That's not something that we have heard about. I think that again, if you look at the nature of any of the deals that have had issues associated with that, they look nothing like this. So we don't anticipate that.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, Rick, on your -- answering one of the question, you mentioned that you see EUV and DUV to process control intensity similar \u2013 in a similar or even a higher level. Can you clarify that? Is that mostly coming in with higher reticle inspection in EUV? And just to be really clear, are you talking about EUV versus similar type of multi-patterning DUV process, you get a similar process control CapEx per CapEx spend? If you can provide some color on that. Thank you.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. Well, we haven't worked out the entire model of that. But if you're just talking about what it takes in process control intensity to support a deep UV scanner versus what it takes to support an EUV scanner, obviously an EUV scanner is more expensive. But the tools necessary from a process control standpoint to support that are more advanced or are more intense. So the resulting intensity around a scanner choice actually goes up slightly in terms of total dollars, acknowledging that the cost of an EUV scanner is higher, the process control intensity actually scale a little bit faster than the scanner cost in order to support it. And that's simply the ecosystem around the scanner. So the reticle qualifying, the wafer is qualifying, the image, the measurements that are necessary to support that. It doesn't take into account all the other things where there'd be a reduction in layers. But just from that standpoint, so we view the EUV as being a catalyst for additional growth for KLA-Tencor as it comes online.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Actually that's very helpful. Thank you.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Mr. Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I'm still trying to make sense of this foundry shipment into the back half of the year. If you look at Lam's shipments, and I know that Lam's obviously a different company but \u2013 and you sort of noodle through their guidance, it implies that foundry shipments are like up 2x the second half versus first half. And if you graphed their shipments versus your shipments, there's a pretty strong correlation between the trend for them and the trend for you. And it seems like maybe this time it's like breaking down a little bit, and maybe the answer is that you are seeing an offset from this change at a big logic customer, maybe that's sort of offsetting some of what would otherwise be a very, very strong foundry ramp so that that stuff ultimately comes back, but maybe it just gets pushed into next year. I'm just kind of trying to make sense of that. Thank you.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, Tim. It's Bren. So our foundry shipments of the second half are higher than the first half. So I want to be clear about that and in a pretty meaningful way. I mean, I think it's getting dwarfed by the amount of the memory shipments. But when you talk about shipment profile in the range that we discussed, somewhere in the $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion range, the 60% to 70% of that will be memory, and that's how we're seeing it. But there is a pickup. But on an absolute basis, certainly foundry is weaker overall compared to the inflections in memory we're seeing.","Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, Bren. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may ask your questions.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up. KLA has always kind of separated itself from the pack due to its premium margin structure or free cash flow generation. I'm just trying to do a sanity check here. So pro forma for Orbotech, I think the target operating margin is looking to be 36%. So are the free cash flow margins going to be somewhere in that kind of 32% to 34% range? Or how should we think about free cash flow margins pro forma for the combined company?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes. So when we look at pro forma operating margins in the timeframe of, let's say, post synergy realization, 2020 pro forma, you'll end up with about, yeah, 36% or so operating income. So if we think against that level of income, we would see free cash flow margins somewhere in the \u2013 consistent with where we are today, maybe slightly below because our operating margins are a little bit higher. But the relative capital intensity of the two businesses is similar. So I think we're in and around that 30% range against that level of operating income. And obviously, it'll vary depending on where we are in terms of working capital investments and so on.","But one thing that's attractive about the business is the growth but also the lower capital intensity of it. And so as we bring it together, and as we start to drive through synergies and scale these businesses and get up to these mid- to high-30% operating margins, we should be able to drive free cash flow margin somewhere in the \u2013 right around 30% plus or minus.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, please continue.","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in KLA-Tencor.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin Kessel","Thank you, Charlie, and welcome to KLA's earnings conference call to discuss the results of the December 2019 quarter and outlook for the March 2020 quarter. ","Joining me on our call today is Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending December 31, 2019 that we released today after the market closed and is currently posted on the investor relations section of our website at ir.kla.com.","Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. The detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future Investor Events and Presentations including those from our September 2019 Investor Day and Corporate Governance Information, including our quite period policy, as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. ","Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick?","Rick Wallace","Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with a high-level strategic overview aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I covered the near term December quarter of business highlights.","Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying giving a set against a backdrop of still lackluster memory demand.","As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients in the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity and advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes, as well as Megatron's driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries.","Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model given that we spent a fair amount of time in our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it maybe which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did. Expected continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution height and accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.","Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's result point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these.","Please turn to Slide 7 for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. I'll begin by addressing the Coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace.","Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring this situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Non withstanding this hopefully short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets; the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and roll out of 5G; growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance in return on investment.","KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes. The demands of support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021 driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top-line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model.","In terms of our outlook for the WFP wafer demand environment in 2020 given the recent news of increased CapEx investment from leading foundry and logic customers, and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth here for WFE coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019. ","Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond.","We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of pattern wafer, print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019. An adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-Beam Inspection Platform in multiple years and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-Beam Inspection Platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership.","This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today. We can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes. After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production ready version of the X-Ray Metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor day, the AXION platform is a small angle x-ray scattering technology for in-line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improved cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques.","We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last but certainly not least KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fabulus Asian and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base.","As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses.","Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the New Year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions positioned KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day.","Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. As we look ahead, we're confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and products energy programs are firmly on track and progressing well.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion.","Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was at 34%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66. Both of which were also at the upper end --of the range of guidance at $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69 respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around and we remain laser focused on our overall execution, as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech.","During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchasing consistently going forward. A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar 2019, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks.","Please turn to Slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength and foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFP demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment from multiple foundry and logic customers. Investment in the EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020.","As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process controlled revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8% versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations.","I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor process segment. As a reminder SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and as a leader in TBD and H process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year -- to be a year of strong growth driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year.","On a very encouraging note, SPTS has ended the December 2019 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year growth for PCB driven by the transition to 5G smartphones.","Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 40%; patterning which includes reticles inspection was 19%; wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%; PCB displaying component inspection revenue was 9%; service was 24% of revenue in the quarter; other was 4%.","In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%; China was 25%; Japan was 13%; Korea was 12%; the US was 11%; Europe was 6% and the rest of Asia was 3%.","Please turn to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments. Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%.","Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income is $422 million and we had just under $159 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.","Please turn to Slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter.","Please turn to Slide 15 for review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019 it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.","Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR at 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company systemic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings.","Please turn to Slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the Coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process. As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China both in Hubei province in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as the access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base.","In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty and our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher to midpoint without the adjustments for the Coronavirus impact.","Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% and semi process control system revenue in the March quarter depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue in next quarter. Based on product mixed expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margins to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%. ","Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography. And initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year.","For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share and non GAAP diluted EPS at $2.04 to $2.82 per share.","Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9% earnings per share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress towards our 2020 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share.","With that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A.","Kevin Kessel","Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to ensure we get as through as many questions as possible. With that Charlie, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","You first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J.Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question you talked about 2020 year-over-year growth of high single to low double-digit. And based on the other segments, it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9% - 11%. So curious is that the right math? And then as part of that what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020 presumably a year with more memory which is an obvious negative, however, you have your new x-ray tool and growing share at NAND as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV. So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE both good and bad in 2020.","BrenHiggins","Yes. Sure. CJ, it's Bren. I'll go first here just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean certainly 2019 finished much more much stronger than what we expected which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to the last earnings versus where we are today given what we've seen in the foundry logic space. We'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much that we'll see flash memory recover. We would expect to see that through the year. And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecasts in terms of incremental WFE investment.","So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, okay, where's the growth coming from so certainly our logic foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point.","C.J.Muse","Very helpful. And as my follow-up, how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business? I imagine that that's much more of a second half Apple weighted kind of ramp. So is there any sort of kind of range first half second half kind of mix there.","BrenHiggins","I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. We expect this year to be as Rick had indicated a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind in that part of the business we also have big chunk of it is also service where it's over 90% of its contract pay. So it -- there's a high service utilization on those tools and a stickiness to the investment as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. ","HarlanSur","Good afternoon, guys. Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020. Great services showing on process control in calendar year 2019. According to my calculations your services business was up about 111% and the upper end of your long term target of 9% to 11%. On your full-year view of 10% revenue growth for the business here in calendar 2020 based on your installed base growth in 2019 how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar 2020?","BrenHiggins","So I think when you look at the comparison to the year I mean certainly we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in 2019 that drove the growth rate to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side given the weakness in memory particularly in the first half of the year; it did push us down towards slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at 2020 though as we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory but also in the logic space over the course of the year, we would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there certainly that the contract penetration is as high as Rick had indicated.","I think with rising utilization with new products given demand from customers as they ramp new facilities; we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus 2019.","HarlanSur","Yes. I appreciate the insights there. And a big part of the growth for the team has been draw of -- that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles right. Gen5, Teron for EUV as an example. So that then can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs like x-ray for stack profiling, e-beam both for wafer and medical maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues.","RickWallace","Yes. I'll take part of that and then Bren could talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products we introduced the AXION and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're seeing POS now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before we're under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out 2023 the plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year. We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected and we're seeing momentum grow there.","So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded and so Bren can talk a little bit of sizing.","BrenHiggins","Yes to Rick's point, I mean it is an important part of our strategy here to see the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings and customers. And so initial results are pretty promising and it's one of the really one of the factors as we look at those products whether it's incremental Gen5, print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab in EUV or whether it's e-beam to Rick's point or x-ray metrology. We're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in 2020 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady-state expectation for those business because we're starting to seeing the market with those products but we will see revenue and I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity a flat despite that the memory growth that we would expect to see in 2020.","RickWallace","The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll just for more perspective the Gen5 adoption is accelerated throughout the 2019 and now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications and where it's really gaining subtraction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think it's a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV. We're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now open. ","DavidWong","Thanks very much. Could you give us some ideas to what percent of your semi equipment sales out to domestic Chinese chipmakers?","BrenHiggins","I would say probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019 it was about $665 million on what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue.","DavidWong","Okay. Great. And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year-over-year for the March quarter, of course confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago. So can you give us some idea about what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year-over-year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech?","BrenHiggins","Yes. So we would expect and again with some range to this but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about 1,215 to let's say 1,230 - 1,235 in that ballpark. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.","TimothyArcuri","Thanks a lot. So, Bren, I'm just looking at the second half of 2019, I'm just looking at your process control system shipments. And you did 831 in September and you just did 875 in last September you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4. So that's up like small single digits year-over-year, but if I add together Intel and TSMC CapEx, it's up like more than 30%. So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher. I'm just wondering if maybe there's some timing effect there or how you sort of -- how you sort of reconcile those numbers? Thanks.","BrenHiggins","So, Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half over half in the second half versus the first half of 2019.","TimothyArcuri","Yes, Bren. I guess I was talking second half of 2019 versus second half of 2018.","BrenHiggins","Second half of 2019 versus second half of 2019 --","TimothyArcuri","Yes. Basically --barely up.","BrenHiggins","Yes. It looks like it's up a few hundred million.","TimothyArcuri","I guess the question is you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic so why would it be up so little when those guys CapEx is up massively. I mean it's up 30 plus percent.","RickWallace","Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period.","TimothyArcuri","Got it, Rick. Okay. So it's a timing issue, okay. Thanks. ","BrenHiggins","Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, it's not a way I've really thought about it. So we can follow up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean you get different customers, different customer mix. You have the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean if you look at our year-over-year performance in a down year for the industry it down what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly may be I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at this detailed logic was not all that strong for us over -- really over the course of most of 2019. So I think that the relative performance was pretty good in 2019 versus 2018.","RickWallace","Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer and we talked about that that 2019 was softer than 2018. And so some of the business you would have seen in 2018 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue.","BrenHiggins","Yes. Bare wafer was down; bare wafer was down about 10% year-to-year, so that was another factor as well.","TimothyArcuri","Okay. Awesome. Got it. And then, Rick, I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously you've widened the range, but I think you also said something about potential policy changes. What did you --were you referring to Export Control that could come about or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that? Thanks.","RickWallace","No. Just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- as you know rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China, but also Wuhan in particular and following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Santor with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","KrishSantor","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two one. First one for either Rick or Bren. If a look at your March quarter guidance, looks like sequentially foundries up while memory is down. I'm kind of curious how why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back? And secondly in an environment where people think foundry logic CapEx is front half loaded, should we assume that's how your revenues have to trend or is it tough to say at this point? And then I have a follow up.","BrenHiggins","Well, Krish, on the memory recovery is more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment and so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery or I'm sorry memory until we move into the second half of the year.","KrishSantor","Got it. And then just as a follow-up if the memory recoveries wouldn't be back half loaded and foundry logic is front half loaded, how does it impact your gross margin profile?","BrenHiggins","There are no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types, but customer segments doesn't drive influence our gross margin unless the product makes dramatically changes? But product is the same margin generally across all segments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","JohnPitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question, Bren, in your prepared comments you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3% to 5% higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the Coronavirus. I'm just kind of curious is that through the EPS as well or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number? And so EPS would actually be up more, kind of, had a higher revenue midpoint.","BrenHiggins","Yes. The assumption is really about revenue, it's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it affect our overall plan for 2020. So I would think that that business just shifts into the first part of, or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change but based on how we see it today that's how we're thinking about it. So the 3% to 5% is basically just comes off the top the same expectations for spending and of course there's a gross margin impact to that which is reflected in the guidance.","So we widen the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in Hubei province but even broader China and how that restarts not just with customers but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now.","JohnPitzer","That's helpful. And then as my follow on, Rick, it's always helpful when you get kind of your perspective at the industry. I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit; your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year 2020. Wondering if you endorsed that forecast? And if you don't want to get too specific with numbers, I'm just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE? There's a lot of concern that maybe it's front half weighted versus second half weighted. How do you kind of see the half on half both for WFE and your business this year?","RickWallace","Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, is very strong and very encouraging the number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong. And it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry logic and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength their. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view and as Bren just indicated it's earlier for us to size what second half and as you know, we don't give annual guidance.","But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment and even if you look at the way 2019 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn it's pretty good downturn because 2019 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the Coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020 and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it and for us we definitely feel momentum and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demands and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number but we definitely feel more positive about 2020 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong 2019 ended.","BrenHiggins","John, and the only other things I'll add to that is to Rick's point, I mean look strength and timing to memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard and so certainly people have different views on that and depending on which markets that you tend to do better and you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is how much growth that we see in China? How robust is the growth? We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wildcards if you will is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side. So certainly there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side that are investing and overall but it's more foundry logic heavy. So I think the memory sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast.","But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single low double-digit kind of range plus or minus and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year. Given the flexibility, we believe having the factory if it turns out that it's stronger than that we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that if that materializes that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.","VivekArya","Thanks for taking my questions. I get that you're taking a conservative view to Q1. When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry, they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China that there is sufficient time to recover from it. So let's assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now, do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter or it's too early to make that determination? Like is there a demand destruction here or do you think that there is a chance for catch up here?","BrenHiggins","Yes. Vivek, so when I look at it, I think that business just shifts, part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business and Huawei or in Wuhan and in Hubei Province there. An impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area given it's the epicenter of the Coronavirus so far that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover. And so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that. Perhaps we're a little bit later than the others and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view and but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to, as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that will ship that capability in the June quarter and in that timeframe.","RickWallace","Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes to mind to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that and we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there, I think it's, if it's a temporary disruption it comes back and that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now.","VivekArya","Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past? And within that is it a difference between NAND or DRAM process control intensity?","RickWallace","There is higher, I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in especially in NAND had a huge desire for more process control capability. We just didn't necessarily have the solution so that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes and we're seeing adoption as a result of this new product. So that's driving process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking and so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements.","So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions not so much by need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","ToshiyaHari","Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. Just a quick follow-up on the Coronavirus impacts. Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain or have you received changes in terms of demand signals from customers or if you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative?","RickWallace","Yes. We're not seeing any change in the customer needs and in fact, if anything we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions and I think that that is something that we continue to model and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details.","BrenHiggins","But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems and its supply chain that could be dual sourced but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now when those suppliers are able to come back online, their people can actually get back into the factory we would expect to have very little if any disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed then it would have a broader impact and again another reason for the wider range and so.","RickWallace","And maybe the last point. I know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that they're still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off and so as they go back we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out.","ToshiyaHari","Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on SPTS. Bren, you talked about exiting the year with record backlog, it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year. In addition to RF, I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half, but if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year that would be helpful. Thank you.","BrenHiggins","Yes. I mean certainly 5G and increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G but also in the mobility cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive, there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in 2019. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in 2019, so we're comfortable or optimistic about seeing that part of the business recover. And I would expect SPTS if you add the two together both in terms of what 5G is driving and automotive you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth here for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities, packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","JoeQuatrochi","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looked to be in a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles. And then are those net new opportunities or are they competitive to put displacements?","RickWallace","Joe. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the, we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier over process control adoption stages back up and say the process control intensity in 2020 being nominally flat to 2019. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically and that's a function of the new products that we have, as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use case in terms of what we're seeing for example for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity improving as we see it in the memory specifically in the NAND.","BrenHiggins","Yes. I think to Rick's point I mean one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements and so as the stacks are rising flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so where we have capabilities for that and then certainly the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products and we feel pretty good about that both with new products from metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market.","To Rick's point, DRAM with the introduction of EUV into DRAM even a single layer or two that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects which tends to drive our inspection business. And with the broader portfolio we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there are opportunities for we have to execute but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It'll never look like foundry logic but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute.","JoeQuatrochi","That's healthful. And then just as a quick follow up, your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020? I apologize I missed it. Is that still flat year-over-year?","BrenHiggins","No. It's one of the drivers that have changed these last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But, yes, I would expect to see it grow and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","SidneyHo","Thanks for taking my question. Just to following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter. I understand memory CapEx recoveries more second half but it does imply a sharp decline quarter-over-quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level. So what was driving that dynamics in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year?","BrenHiggins","Well, you have multiple customers investing in and right now when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression but very little new capacity particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shift into that business more in the December quarter, so it could be a timing issue between what we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it, but memory in the March quarter is kind of weak. And we expect to see it strengthened as we move through the year.","SidneyHo","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow up is, sorry if this has been asked earlier but last quarter you had expected revenue to come down like 5% half over half in the first half of calendar 2020. And given calendar Q4 was much stronger does that change the slope of that and assuming that the Coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year. And how should we think about first half over second half for this year?","BrenHiggins","I think it's a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of 2020 given the assumptions that we have on the Coronavirus and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business.","End of Q&A","Operator","We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters.","Kevin Kessel","Thank you and thank you everyone for your time and interest in KLA, today.

Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven\u2019t seen the release, you can find it in our website.","Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in the Investor Presentation on KLA-Tencor\u2019s Investor Relations website.","There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018.

KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding result in the September quarter, driven by the company\u2019s technology and market leadership, and the compelling value of our diversified product and service portfolio in enabling customer success.","The September quarter results also show the company is benefiting from our strategies for market leadership and revenue diversification. Furthermore, they demonstrate their critical nature of process control and enabling technology inflections in the semiconductor industry, including growth markets such as vertical NAND, EUV adoption and the China semiconductor industry.","And with the expected closing this quarter of the Orbotech acquisition, KLA-Tencor will further extend its market reach in the electronics value chain, enhancing the company\u2019s product and services portfolio beyond our core and WFE to address new growth markets where technological complexity is rising and where KLA can extend its core competencies into exciting new opportunities.","Now for some perspective on the current industry demand environment, first, notwithstanding, the recent adjustments in capacity investment for memory customers and delays in logic spend from the second half of 2018 into 2019, we believe the long-term factors underpinning demand in the wafer fab equipment industry remain sound. This is the result of several key elements, including more diversified end markets for semiconductor.","The ongoing commitment of customers to driving innovation and leading-edge technology roadmaps, disciplined market-driven capacity planning and the high levels of investment required to address increased design complexity and advanced device architectures. We expect these industry drivers will persist in delivering long-term growth and value creation opportunities for the company, the industry and for all our stakeholders.","Moving now to the recent highlights that demonstrate successful execution of the company\u2019s strategic focus on technology and market leadership, first, as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable growth of the semiconductor industry in China.","Memory and foundry manufacturers in this region are investing in a high level to accelerate process development and yield learning. We expect momentum in China to continue in 2019 and beyond with customers progressing their technology roadmaps and ramping new production capacity in the initial phase of a multiyear investment cycle.","Additionally, over the past several quarters, we have seen exceptional demand for bare waver and mask inspection products. Growth in our mask inspection business is consistent with planned increases in CapEx from the leading foundries as these customers ramp 7-nanometer capacity to support a high number of customer tapeouts at this node and begin aggressive development of 5-nanometer, including EUV development.","In bare wafer, KLA\u2019s market-leading inspection and metrology tools are key enablers of the growth in wafer supply to address capacity expansion in memory. These products are also essential in helping customers in all segments to meet more stringent design specification for wafer flatness and cleanliness.","And finally, KLA-Tencor service business continues to be a highlight. Going forward, it is on a trajectory to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit annual revenue growth with low business volatility consistent with historical trends.","Long-term growth and services is tied to expansion of the installed base, as well as from the increasing uptime requirements from current node production and at the trailing edge. Trailing edge fabs are currently running at near full utilization, creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades.","In summary, before I turn the call over to Bren, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding performance in the September quarter, driven by the company\u2019s strong execution and market leadership.","Given our momentum in the marketplace, diversified growth markets and the critical role the company\u2019s products and services play in enabling customer success, we are positioned for a strong finish in 2018.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bren for his review of the financial results. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, gross margin and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter.","Revenue was $1.09 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.46. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings was a discrete tax benefit taken in the quarter related to new guidance affecting our adoption of the new tax law in the United States.","As a reminder, since this is the first quarter of our new fiscal year 2019, our results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, all revenue commentary in our results and guidance exclusively reflect our adoption of the new standard and we do not plan to provide any color related to the financial results under the previous standard.","In today\u2019s press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now for highlights for the -- of the September demand environment in terms of shipments, total shipments were $1.007 billion, above the $975 million midpoint and at the top-end of guidance for the quarter, driven by strength in memory and an expected sequential increase in shipments to foundry customers. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in a range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, consistent with the update we provided in early September.","Our current outlook is for shipments in the first half of calendar 2019 to be modestly higher compared with the second half of 2018. The shipment profile in the first half of 2019 is expected to show accelerating momentum from foundry customers driven by 7-nanometer design starts and 5-nanometer development activity, consistent investment from logic customers and a balanced mix in memory.","Memory was 57% of shipments in September. DRAM accounted for 26% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory to be strong again in this quarter and approximately 64% of total shipments.","Foundry was 38% of shipments in the September quarter and is forecasted to be about 22% of the total in December. Logic shipments were 5% of the total in Q3 and the current outlook is for logic to be 14% in December.","The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 27%, patterning includes shipments reticle inspection, service 22% and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%.","I will turn now to the income statement. Revenue was $1.09 billion in September and finishing at the top-end of the range of guidance. We expect December revenue to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.11 billion for the quarter.","Gross margin was 65.2% and also at the top-end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving the strong gross margin performance in September were consistent with recent margin trends, with the upside largely driven by product mix. In December, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% as a slightly weaker product mix is offset by higher service and manufacturing efficiencies.","Total operating expenses were $263 million in September, as non-headcount engineering program investments were lower than expected in the quarter due to timing issues related to prototype materials.","We expect to incur those expenses in the December quarter, as we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $275 million at the midpoint, with variability around this operating expense level driven principally by the timing of these types of program development costs.","Looking forward for the next several quarters, we are modeling quarterly operating expenses in the $270 million to $275 million range, based on planned program -- product development requirements and our current topline expectations. Operating margin in September was 41.1%.","The effective tax rate was an 11.3% in the quarter and below the 15% long-term tax planning rate as business mix and further implementation of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in the U.S. impacted our rate. We will provide an update to the planning rate for the company inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition when we report results for the December quarter.","Finally, net income for the quarter was $384 million and we ended the quarter with 156.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For the December quarter, you should model share count at approximately 153 million.","I will turn now to highlight for the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.8 billion. Cash from operations was $381 million and free cash flow was $359 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $123 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully-vested restricted stock units and repurchased 300 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.","We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization and expect to complete this program over the next few quarters, consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional 1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition.","Finally, in regards to the adoption of ASC 606, please refer to our 10-Q filing for a detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition under the new and legacy standards. These differences are largely driven by timing of revenue recognition, principally due to and control the products\u2019 transfers to the customer.","Under ASC 606, we see reduction in the time period between shipment and revenue recognition compared to the previous standard. Based on the product and customer mix in our current shipment and revenue forecasts, we expect reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable for calendar \u201818 and in the range of 2.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The difference in revenue recognition between ASC 606 and the legacy standard could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but will narrow over a multiple quarter time horizon.","In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor in the September quarter reflect the company\u2019s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer\u2019s growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model.","As the market leader in process control coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term value to stockholders.","With that to summarize guidance for the December quarter is, shipments in the range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.88 per share to $2.20 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS at $2.02 per share to $2.34 per share.","Before turning the call over for your questions, I\u2019d like to announce we have scheduled an Investor Day for March 6, 2019 in New York City. Please circle that date on your calendars and keep an eye out for further details and a formal invite in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you all in New York.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open the call up to your questions. We once again request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to give everyone a chance to rejoin today\u2019s call as time permits.","All right, Chantal, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you much. Hi, guys. I had two. First of all, I am sure you saw the news today about the export restrictions to Jinhua, which is one of the three big memory fabs of course being built this was shipping to this year. So my first question is, does this sort of change how you think about your business next year, it seems to be a little more surgical than sort of likely to spread to be a big broad export restriction, but I am curious of your thoughts? Thanks.","Rick Wallace","Hey, Tim. This is Rick and then Bren will follow. It does not change our view for the rest of 19 -- \u201818 or what we are looking at a \u201819 based on the expectation we had from that customer. To your point, it was a strategical export control, obviously, other things would change if that were broadened, but as it stands today it does not change our view.","Bren Higgins","Yeah. Tim, I think, as we look at this year, we feel pretty good about the tools that we have shipped there and closing on that business. There\u2019s some de minimis levels of business in our ship plans over the next several quarters and into our forecast for next year for that side. But I don\u2019t think it changes in a material way anyway of how we are really thinking about the business going forward.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then, Bren, service was up a lot, it was up 26% year-over-year, a big inflection. I guess, my question is, are you doing something different in service that caused a big inflection and can service grow that much year-over-year in December and then as you get in the first half of next year? Thank you.","Bren Higgins","No. Tim, that\u2019s a result of our adoption of 606 and what is happening there and I provided some color in the last call on this topic for -- to provide a little bit of clarity and there will be more in the -- in our SEC disclosures that we will file in the next couple of days.","But what we are doing here is that given the experience of our customers around our obligations in the first year warranty, is very similar to second year and third year contracts, as we are having to carve out of the tool purchase and defer the revenue associated with that first year obligation.","Historically, with the cost accrual, so what happened is, we have reversed the cost accrual and then for the tools under warranty, we have added the deferred revenue, which we will take over the next 12 months effectively for all tools that were under warranty effective the transition date to 606 on June 30th.","So it\u2019s a unique dynamic that you saw with a pretty big inflection. I think the dynamics around our service business are consistent Rick talked about in terms of our views of growth rate going forward.","But you will see this, this step up that will happen here and we will see it probably play out over the next couple of quarters and then it will level back out something consistent with what we saw historically.","So, no changes in cash flow or business operations, but given the experience is fundamentally consistent with second year and third year contracts, the literature guides us this direction in terms of how we treat those obligations.","Timothy Arcuri","Awesome, guys. Thank you so much.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Bren, maybe to follow-up just on Tim\u2019s question there, relative to your view that first half of \u201819 should be higher than second half of \u201818. If you could elaborate a little bit about what\u2019s driving that views. How much of a benefit is 606. Is the expectation that the memory adjustments are now behind you or is -- are you still seeing memory uncertainty but logic and foundry has really given you that confidence, any color there would be helpful?","Bren Higgins","Hey. John, it\u2019s Bren. So those were shipments\u2019 statements, not revenue and I think it\u2019s an important distinction here, because as we go through this transition, one anchor of continuity is the shipment metric, which is why we are continuing to provide not only actual results and context, but also guidance. So to be consistent with what we had said previously and to be consistent with this metric that is unchanging, our commentary reflects that.","So as we move into this first half, I think, that the way the second half of this year has played out is very similar to the way we described in an update that we did back in September, where the September quarter came in a little bit stronger, December quarter sequential growth weaker and consistent with that guidance.","So as we look at the first half of next year, we see an increase in the foundry and logic investment and we see memory in a relatively balanced profile as we move into the first half of the year. I would say that it is modest growth in terms of our expectations and we look at the build plan. But -- and I am not going to comment at this point of whether given where we are whether it\u2019s March or June, but as we look at the first half given the timing and our conversations with customers, that\u2019s how we are seeing the first half play out at least at this point in terms of shipments.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And maybe as my follow up just relative to all the consternation and concern about memory. It was interesting to hear you say that you believe memory shipments as a percent of overall shipments will grow sequentially in the December quarter. Rick, I wondering you just talk to what extent that that\u2019s rising sort of intensity of what you do in the memory market versus just timing of projects, any help on sort of the rising intensity would be helpful?","Rick Wallace","It\u2019s the intensity has stepped up but it\u2019s more consistent with what we have seen over the last year. Remember we have other products that contribute to that too such as the bare wafer inspection products, which are leveraged to the memory overall wafer shipment.","So those products have been extremely strong as the wafer demand around the world continues to get stretched and because of flatness requirements, we have seen an uptick in our business for flatness measurement.","So I think it\u2019s more related to those functions and that really has been playing out throughout this memory cycle where intensity has grown partly because of the strength of the wafer houses themselves.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, first one, just to follow up on China. It looks like you guys are not worried too much about the export control impacting your customer or at least your shipments to China so that\u2019s kind of good to know. Is there a way to quantify either, I think, you had said in the past how indigenous China bookings are in the $600 million range for this year or as a percentage of sales like 25% of system sales was China. Is there a way to quantify what it was for the September quarter and then I had a follow up?","Rick Wallace","Yeah. Krish, let me take the first part, and then, let Bren answer. We are not concerned about this particular movement in the market. So this one was a very strategic export control that that let\u2019s just be clear on that.","Krish Sankar","Thanks.","Bren Higgins","Yeah. Krish, so shipments, 27% of shipments in the September quarter were China and that, I would say that most of that is indigenous China. There wasn\u2019t a lot of activity with the multinationals there, probably, a little bit, but not a lot.","And consistently, as we have looked at that indigenous business into this year and into next year, the range you talked about is about how we are seen it in terms of shipment at revenue levels $500 million to $600 million is more foundry centric, a little bit more foundry centric and material centric in 2018, it looks to be that way in 2019 as well, at least from an order perspective, but generally, we expect a continuation of momentum from those customers.","And to the earlier point, I think, we feel, okay, I mean, strategically that this situation around export control tend to be confined to that one particular situation, and as we said earlier, we don\u2019t think it has much effect on how we are running the business or planning for it into next year.","Krish Sankar","Got it. Got it. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow up, your commentary on first half shipments and the fact that next year it would be more weighted towards foundry and logic. Is it fair to assume that, I mean, without any guidance like calendar \u201819 revenue should grow over calendar \u201818 and given it\u2019s more weighted to foundry\/logic. The margin profile or EPS should be better than sales. Is that a fair enough assumption?","Bren Higgins","So, I will make a couple of comments around \u201819 and the first is, we do expect foundry\/logic to be up in \u201819 versus \u201818 and that we expect the first half to be modestly up from a shipment perspective versus \u201818 -- the second half of \u201818. So we will have more to say as we get to the end of this quarter and report results for the December quarter on the total year view. But at least that\u2019s how we see it right now.","You are right. Those segments are good segments for KLA in terms of process control intensity. Our margins are very consistent across our customer base. I don\u2019t think it affects the margin profile or expectations from that business.","But, certainly, that business were more exposed to in terms of the process control intensity of those wafer fab dollars. So we are encouraged by that. We will see how the broader industry plays out and have more to say about that as we move into December and in the first part of next year.","Krish Sankar","Thanks, Bren. Thanks, Rick.","Rick Wallace","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good Afternoon. Good job on the quarterly execution guys and strong free cash flow. Yes or no, talked about shipping 30 EUV systems next year, that\u2019s up from about 18 this year. So the EUV adoption curve is here and it look like it\u2019s a pretty aggressive ramp. You guys are supporting that with your mask inspection, blank inspection, CD overlay Gen 5, print check portfolios. So outside of yes or no, you guys are probably one of the bigger beneficiary, there is EUV ramps and given that ramp adoption next year, can you guys just quantify your EUV related opportunity next year and does this help the team sort of sustain that sort of 64% or 65% gross margin profile maybe into next year?","Rick Wallace","Hi, Harlan. It\u2019s Rick. I will take the first part and then Bren will follow up. Let me start with -- we don\u2019t break out our business by EUV in particular, but to your point there are a lot of drivers about EUV that are frankly good for KLA-Tencor and for helping our customers solve the related problems that they have with it.","And as you mentioned, we are seeing good business and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks in our mask business due to the number of advanced starts that are going through fabs and there\u2019s also support for print check as you mentioned with Gen 5 and also the overlay challenges that our customers face.","So, it is a catalyst and a driver for us as we go forward, but we don\u2019t break it out in particular and we are a little bit agnostic into how many tools there are per se next year. So our demand won\u2019t really change if it\u2019s the 30 tools they talked about or 20 tools. It\u2019s really the driving of the new capability nodes that are driving our business. And, Bren, you can break up the second part.","Bren Higgins","So on gross margins, Harlan, I think, as we look at next year this and in my comments in the script, we see things operating generally around this level, product mix will drive us directionally here and there from quarter-to-quarter. But in and around this 64%-ish plus or minus 50 basis points looks like that\u2019s how things are trending right now.","Obviously, if we see expansion in the business, we should get leverage and that would work probably both directions if it turns out that the revenue were to come down. So, but in terms of the fundamental structural dynamics around margins that\u2019s generally the right place to be.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on your Gen 5 pattern wafer inspection system, I think, you guys have said, anticipated 17 systems, 18 systems in the field by the end of this year, did you guys hit that target and how do you guys see the momentum of Gen 5 going into next year, just given the sharp ramp of EUV, the start of 5-nanometer EUV foundry and 7-nanometer EUV logic development activities?","Bren Higgins","Yes. Harlan, we did hit our target. So we are consistent with the numbers that we provided earlier and we would expect an increase into next year. I would expect revenue from Gen 5 into next year given the drivers that you mentioned that Rick elaborated on, we would expect an increase in Gen 5 revenue in \u201819 versus what we saw in \u201818.","Rick Wallace","And in terms of momentum, it\u2019s playing out very much the same as prior generations when we got the new generations of inspection products or you have a couple of early adopters maybe one big early adopter that will drive it. Then you have customers that are maybe more evaluative of it and they will spend a lot of time trying to figure it out and then the momentum gets going when the customers who have not adopted realize the advantage that the leaders are having and then we see it kind of flow out.","So when we model those, it\u2019s not just the number of systems, it\u2019s where they are located and the use cases. So we have -- some that are being utilized in the early stages of manufacturing support where others are in development.","So we like the momentum of the product, we are finding unique capabilities. It is true that EUV creates more opportunities for that product to differentiate and for customers to rely on it. So we are feeling very good about how we are positioned as we go forward in 2019.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, you have mentioned the potential for first half \u201819 orders to slightly grow half over half. How sensitive is that to assumption of where memory prices will trend?","Bren Higgins","So my statement was around shipments, and not about orders, and I think, right now that the plans our customers have put in front of us given what we are seeing is it doesn\u2019t seem to necessarily be pricing dependent, obviously, that does influence how they think about overall supply.","But we have seen a number of adjustments already and how those have played out through \u201818 and those pushes into \u201819. So based on what we know today, our expectation is to see some balanced investment into the first half of \u201819 from a shipment perspective, and as I said, modestly up versus the second half of \u201818.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And for my follow up, just a question on inventories, they are higher than what we have seen historically. Can you give us some sense of what the range should for whether it\u2019s days or dollars or what have you over the next several quarters? Thank you.","Bren Higgins","You are right. It\u2019s a good question and they are higher. We have seen some increases related to some of our long lead time products that are in the queue, namely the reticle inspection products and we talked about some of the incremental demand that we are seeing for that tool and those are long lead times so we have to get in the queue to buy that those materials early.","We have a number of new products that are coming out and so we are spinning up supply chain to support that in some cases you work -- we are working with newer suppliers and so, we are buying early to qualify parts to support a ramp. We have a new product launch in laser scanning, in E-beam. We talked about Gen 5 and the increments for Gen 5 into next year.","So, all those things are driving the inventory levels higher. As we move over then that I would expect based on what we are seeing in terms of output expectations into next year that we will see that number flatten out and that will be -- that\u2019s a -- as we start to put that material into tools and ship those tools out.","So we are committing earlier and in those cases to make sure we have got the products in position so we can ramp them and that\u2019s where we see in our financials is in the inventory build.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.","CJ Muse","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, back on deferred revenues. It looks like that ticked up from June to September by $300 plus million. So is that the kind of number we should be thinking about in terms of an increase for deferred in fiscal \u201819 versus fiscal \u201818?","And as a second part to that, should we be thinking about deferred being isolated to certain long lead time or newer products and are there certain gross margins associated with those products vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of your mix?","Bren Higgins","Yeah. CJ, maybe this is something we need to reconcile with you, but deferred revenue, revenue backlog should come down. One thing about the 606 is, given the timing issues and given our implementation of 605, which was rules based and as a result took us longer to meet the conditions of transfer and customer acceptance, under 606 we get there much faster. So from the time we ship a tool till the time we revenue, it should only be about a month. So we should see deferred revenue related to that to come down.","I talked a little bit about the warranty dynamic earlier, which will play out over the next few quarters. But there isn\u2019t anything in particular that\u2019s -- that special or unique about certain products is more really based on, if you ship a new product and it\u2019s first of a kind of matching requirement things like that, that we have to go all the way to an acceptance on.","But under 606 you go to that acceptance level and in a much faster way, and then all the follow-on tools are generally, you see revenue at shipment. As you know the installation acceptance process becomes or is considered more perfunctory from an accounting perspective. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening and I would expect the deferred revenues to come down over time given those dynamics.","CJ Muse","Very helpful. And as a follow-up, as you think about just the Jinhua ruling from the Department of Commerce. How are you thinking if at all that could impact MOFCOM and their willingness to sign off on your acquisition of Orbotech?","Rick Wallace","We have not -- we have had dialog and discussions and we are proceeding along the path that we had modeled where we were in terms of regulatory in China. We feel very good about the exchange that we are having and we believe we are on track to close that out this calendar year, so as we have said at this quarter. So we feel good about that we have seen no indication of any change in their posture based on any of the other things that are going on relative to trade.","CJ Muse","Good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Rick, you called out at Foundry 5-nanometer as one of the potential drivers heading into first half of \u201819 and I realize it\u2019s really early. But how do you think about that node in terms of contribution to your business over the next couple of years?","Rick Wallace","Well, I mean, I think, it will be a continuation of the expansion we have seen in terms of the newer products that we have are going to be targeted at 5-nanometer. We see the process control intensity challenges are very significant for our customers because that that\u2019s the node in which EUV is going to be adopted in a greater percentage. Some people are looking at some level of EUV at 7, but 5 is really where it increases an adoption then will drive a lot of use.","So we are well positioned for now. We are working closely with the customers that are pushing their technology and this is part of the Gen 5 discussion that we have had in the past where a Gen 5 is really more of a development tool, if you go back a year ago and now it\u2019s becoming more of a pilot tool an early production in 5-nanometer becomes more biased toward production. So we feel great about where we are with that tool but also the supporting metrology tools as well.","Bren Higgins","In the first part of next year we will see the 7-nanometer tapeouts that are currently -- customers currently talking about we will see that drive up some activity, we are seeing in the mask shop, we will see it in the wafer fab as well and we will start to see more the n5 investments in early development as we move towards the second half of the year.","As Rick said, it\u2019s a challenging node, it\u2019s a bigger node for EUV and we have got a number of products that are targeted for it. And I think, it will be interesting and intriguing business for us as we move into the second half of the year.","Toshiya Hari","Great. And then as a quick follow up, on bare wafer inspection, I think, this is another segment or product group rather that you guys have called out over the past couple, if not several quarters. I realize it\u2019s a high margin business for you guys. I think some of your customers or all of your customers remain pretty constructive in the 2018, I am sorry, 2019 in terms of their outlook in terms of pricing, but some of them have toned it down a little bit, just given the weakness in memory and in certain parts of logic. How sustainable do you think this business is for you? I ask, because, in the past, I think, it\u2019s been pretty volatile for you guys? Thank you.","Rick Wallace","We are certainly in a period where there\u2019s both there\u2019s kind of three things working at once in favor of this business, which is there\u2019s capacity expansion, there\u2019s technological challenges associated with these activity and there\u2019s increased flatness requirements.","So it is true that that has stepped up the level of business. So we are modeling as we go forward is, we don\u2019t see that level of growth going forward again where we have essentially over the last few years that business has grown quite a bit. But the sustainability of the current levels is what we are modeling in terms of when we talk with our customers as they continue to bring on capability.","And remember, the percent of their wafers that are going to leading-edge right now is relatively small and so over time they have to convert more of that to leading edge and so we will be feathering in our products and support of that.","So we feel pretty good about the current level of business that we have in the bare wafer and its sustainability. We don\u2019t see another leg up though as we saw in the last few years as we went to this node.","Toshiya Hari","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow up to your comments on the memory market lease in the near-term, when you are discussing about a balanced memory market, does that include the combination of DRAM and NAND or are you seeing one or the other potentially driving the first half of \u201819 outlook that you detailed?","Bren Higgins","So that\u2019s the statement on our expectations for shipments into the first half. That it\u2019s a relatively balanced shipment profile across the two segments. So I don\u2019t really have much more to say than that.","I think we feel pretty good. We have to remember one thing about KLA is that we tend to be more about enabling technology and less about just raw capacity expansion and so as long as our customers are continuing to push their roadmaps and they are in DRAM and they are pursuing you know incremental layers in NAND that we see and expect to see a continued level of business from those customers irrespective of the capacity adjustments that could happen.","Rick Wallace","Yeah. And we don\u2019t just agree with the industry perspective that DRAM Investment in \u201819 will be coming down, we did see foundry up and so. But as Bren said it\u2019s -- that\u2019s not as much of the driver for us as the other factors he mentioned.","Patrick Ho","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe, Rick, as a follow up in terms of China and the indigenous market, particularly on the trailing edge foundry logic segment that\u2019s been a surprising strength for the entire industry in 2018. From a process control intensity standpoint, do you believe the local semiconductor manufacturers on the foundry logic side are seeing the value and this will then continue as they continue to migrate down nodes in the future or I guess, I am a little surprised that there has been so much strength coming out of there given that they can reuse tool or buy used tools in the marketplace?","Rick Wallace","They have a -- there\u2019s another process challenges I think that they are facing even though they have as you say that there -- they have the options that some of the bigger players might have tried to leverage.","But it\u2019s harder when you are relatively new and your scale isn\u2019t as big to be able to do the reuse and some of the things that you have seen in the other places. So they are also tackling a number of technology challenges at once.","We have excellent relationships there and we feel very good about the sustainability of that business. On a relative basis too, when you look at those fabs in terms of the scale they are significantly smaller, as I said, than what you\u2019d see elsewhere.","So, I think, it continues to be strong, I do think there\u2019s even potential for more in the way of things like mash ups, where you will continuously strength. Ultimately they\u2019d like to have wafer manufacturing, but I think that\u2019s several years away before that would be a significant piece of that.","Bren Higgins","Well, they also are challenged to get used equipment, it\u2019s a pretty tight market out there and we will sell at time you scale the equipment, we don\u2019t really have in any of that in inventory. So what we have done is we have restarted older product lines to support some of that business or you are seeing current revenues or products that are de-configured to meet these trailing edge needs that certainly have the utility to be upgraded over time from those customers. So they are investing that way, and to Rick\u2019s point, I mean, there are markets to ship into and eventually they will be able to get to a place where they can do that.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I want to get your thoughts on the use of EUV for DRAM, when you think it gets implemented on DRAM and how you guys could benefit from that?","Rick Wallace","Well, I think, that the, you are going to start seeing some adoption of it very much depends on the economics, I think, and that\u2019s going to be the big challenge. But I think we are going to see some in 2019 beyond what we have seen in pilot in 2018.","It\u2019s really a similar story that to what we see in logic, where EUV presents opportunities both in terms of the mask shop, obviously, with DRAM, you don\u2019t have the number of starts, but you do have very significant concerns about lifetime and contamination and EUV cleanliness overall.","But I think it\u2019s much more about the scalability and scaling of the design role in DRAM and also some of the challenges they are trying to get around in terms of overlay control. So it\u2019s a driver, but not as much as it is, of course, than logic.","Atif Malik","Okay. And then on China in a nuclear winter scenario where, let\u2019s say, there are broad restrictions put on equipment suppliers to ship equipment to China. Do you think this spending will just get absorbed elsewhere in Korea or Taiwan or in other fab infrastructure there to take the demand?","Rick Wallace","Boy that\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to speculate on that. But I would think there\u2019s clearly a case that China is investing for strategic reasons, and therefore, it\u2019s more additive in some ways than if they were to not be allowed to invest. So, I think, you\u2019d probably see some impact.","We rate that probability as low and maybe also because of the action that was taken was very targeted and for specific reasons. So we are not modeling that as one of the outcomes. But, yes, I think, that that would have an overall impact on WFE for sure.","Ed Lockwood","Operator, we are ready for next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho","Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the service revenue, want to make sure that, you talk about it takes a few quarters for the revenue recognition to formalize. So should we think about by the end of this fiscal year, you will get back to a longer term trend of, say, 9% to 10% year-over-year?","Bren Higgins","Yes.","Rick Wallace","Yeah. No. That\u2019s a good way to think about it, because you are going to have to work through the deferred revenue associated with all the tools that were under warranty at the time of conversion. So there are some tools that are shipped right at the end of that quarter. So it will take a year for that to completely roll-off, although, it\u2019s likely a little bit heavier in the front end than it is in the back half of the fiscal year. That\u2019s a good way to think about it.","Sidney Ho","Okay. Great. My second question is that, in the past you have talked about trailing edge is now close to 40% of your revenues. Some of the foundries have you talked about overcapacity of 28 nanometers wafers and utilization may come down. Do you expect that to be a short-term phenomenon and do you expect next year you will see trailing edge going back to 40% of the revenues?","Rick Wallace","It looks pretty stable to us as we look at next year around as its more trailing edge that more of a foundry statement than an overall. But given the diversity of end markets around semis, if you look at those customers that are investing in the activity we are seeing. I\u2019d see it being fairly stable. We will have to watch those markets and see. But at least at this point, that\u2019s how it looks to us.","Bren Higgins","Part of what drives those, we have created options for those customers to upgrade their capability and so part of the business that we have for them even in a market where maybe they are not investing in new capacity is to upgrade their existing so they can get more efficient and we are seeing big demand for that and that was the initiative started a couple of years ago to be able to extend the value of the tools that are already in the installed base where we obviously have a home court advantage too.","Sidney Ho","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Chantal. No further commentary from us today. Thank you all for joining. This concludes our conference call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy.","A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results.","More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. The March quarter results for KLA-Tencor were in line with the company's expectations. New bookings in the March quarter were $738 million, down about 3% compared with December. Orders were concentrated among our foundry and logic customers, with particular strength from logic customers in the period. Third quarter revenue was $729 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.01 per share, applying an effective tax rate of 14%, resulting from a onetime R&D tax credit taken in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.89 at our modeled tax rate of 24%. So a good start for KLA-Tencor in calendar year 2013 following a year of very strong relative performance for the company in calendar 2012. In fact, according to Gartner's recently published industry report, KLA-Tencor sustained its strong relative market position in calendar 2012, in an environment in which overall process control market revenues were flat in 2012 and the industry CapEx was down approximately 10%.","These results highlight a continuation of the trend we've seen in this cycle of increasing adoption of process control, as the mobility markets fuel growth in foundry and logic demand and the increasing cost and complexity associated with managing yields makes process control critical to our customer success at the leading edge.","Turning now to our view of the current business environment. Consumer demand for mobile technology continues to be the primary force behind semiconductor industry demand, with strong smartphone and tablet unit growth, competition and increasing device cost and complexity driving our markets today. For KLA-Tencor, the Q3 bookings profile was highlighted by strength in logic demand, with these customers accounting for 25% of bookings in March. We expect logic orders to comprise 32% of our orders next quarter and to be strong into the second half of calendar year 2013, though below first-half levels.","Foundry customers accounted for 47% of new orders in March. We expect foundry orders to comprise 35% of the orders next quarter. And our foundry customer forecast for the second half of 2013 show growth over the first half of the year, with more breadth of demand among these customers. Because foundries tend to be the highest adopters of process control, the sustained high level of foundry investment we've experienced is favorable to KLA-Tencor and a key contributor to our strong relative performance.","Finally, orders from memory customers represented 28% of total orders in March, nearly double the percentage from the December quarter. We expect that memory will be 33% of new orders in the June quarter and that memory demand will strengthen in the second half of calendar 2013. Although we are not currently forecasting significant capacity investment for memory customers in the year, we're encouraged by signs of higher relative adoption of process control and strengthening market share for KLA-Tencor among the leading-edge memory customers.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, our outlook for the industry CapEx investment in the year has moderated somewhat from our initial commentary in January, as our customers adopt a more measured outlook for new wafer capacity investment in the near term and prepare for the next node. We believe some of the major factors impacting the timing of equipment demand in the near term include uncertainty in the potential magnitude and breadth of participation among fabless customers for the 20-nanometer node, challenges associated with the transition from planar to 3D device architectures and a persistently weak global economy.","As a result, our current market outlook, for modest incremental improvements in overall equipment demand in the second half of the year driven more by the breadth of foundry demand, sustained levels of investment from logic and a strong resurgence of demand from Korea, both for logic and memory applications. That said, given the factors I just mentioned, our bias today is for industry CapEx in 2013 to trend toward the lower end of our original down 5% to 10% range for the year. The driving force behind KLA-Tencor's market leadership continues to be our focus on the customer.","With each successive generation of new technology, our customers are facing increased process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirements. Process control is on the critical path to successful management of these complex technical challenges. And as the market leader, KLA-Tencor is positioned to continue to benefit from strong relative adoption of inspection and measurement technologies, as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology roadmaps.","Turning now to guidance for the June quarter. Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $625 million to $775 million. Revenue in the June quarter is expected to be in the range of $670 million to $730 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.66 to $0.86 per share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?","Mark P. Dentinger","Good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges and credits and any cost or credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.03 after-tax difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.","Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.","Q3 new orders were $738 million, down slightly from $760 million in Q2. Q3 net orders were $736 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 17% of new systems orders in Q3, down from 33% in December quarter; Europe was also 17% of new systems orders, up 1% -- up from 1% in Q2; Japan was 9%, up from 7% last quarter; Korea was 10%, down from 13% last quarter; Taiwan was 35%, down slightly from 39% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 12%, up from 7% in Q2.","The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 51% compared with 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 6%, down from 10% last quarter; metrology was 20%, up slightly from 19% in Q2; our non-semi businesses were 3%, even with last quarter; and service was 20% of new orders in Q3, the same as Q2.","Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 47% of new systems orders in Q3 were from foundry customers compared with 67% in Q2; logic customers were 25% of new orders in Q3, up from 16% in Q2; and memory orders were 28% in Q3 versus 17% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for fiscal Q4 will be within a range of $625 million to $775 million.","In Q3, we shipped $694 million, up from $673 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $740 million and $800 million in Q4. Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from the end of December, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2013, included $218 million of revenue backlog, or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $880 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped.","Total revenue for Q3 was $729 million, up 8% from $673 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q3 was $580 million, and services revenue was $149 million. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $670 million and $730 million.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9% this quarter, up from 55.1% last quarter. The major contributors to the quarter-over-quarter improvement in the gross margin percentage were higher systems revenues and lower reserve requirements. For Q4, we are expecting gross margins between 56% and 57.5%.","Operating expenses were $213 million in Q3, almost even with the $214 million we posted in Q2. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be up between $3 million and $7 million from Q3.","OIE was a net $10.1 million expense in Q3, up about $1.7 million from Q2. Most of the quarter-over-quarter increase in OIE was due to a gain on the sale of a nonoperating investment during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of about $10 million in Q4.","In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $28 million or 14% of pretax income versus 29% rate in Q2. The Q3 rate drop was mostly due to the current quarter and catch-up effect from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in January. Our estimate for the non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 is about 24%.","Non-GAAP net income was $171 million or $1.01 per share in Q3. Using our planning tax rate of 24%, our Q2 EPS would have been $0.89. At the revenue range I previously mentioned and applying our tax rate of 24%, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.66 and $0.86 per share.","The weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q3 was 169.2 million versus 169.1 million in Q2. During Q3, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2013, we had approximately 7.1 million shares available under our current authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about 169 million for Q4. We also paid $67 million in dividends in Q3. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in Q4.","On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.9 billion, up $301 million from December 31. Cash generated from operations was $415 million in Q3 compared with $77 million in Q2. The significant improvement in quarterly cash flow from operations was largely attributable to an increase of $190 million in customer collections, as well as lower outlays for trade payables, income taxes and interest on our debt. In all likelihood, Q4 operating cash flow will revert to a more typical result.","Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $454 million, down from $606 million at the end of December. DSO was 57 days at March 31 versus 82 days at December 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring.","Net inventories were down $13 million from Q2 and ended the quarter at $650 million. Inventory turnover, based upon GAAP cost of revenues, was 1.9 turns in Q3, slightly higher than 1.8 turns in Q2. Capital expenditures were $18 million in Q3, up slightly from $17 million in Q2.","Full time headcount at March 31 was 5,830 versus 5,816 at December 31, 2012. We expect our headcount to remain about flat in Q4.","In summary, our guidance for Q4 is new orders between $625 million and $775 million, total revenue between $670 million and $730 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.66 and $0.86 per share, applying a 24% tax rate.","This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay, thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open the call up to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So Jay, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess I was wondering, there is a slight bit of disconnect between what you guys are guiding for the year and what we saw from one of your peers yesterday, and also, what you're looking into June. Is this a segment concentration-type situation that's going on? Or are there any market share changes that's happening that's affecting your outlook?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, Satya, it's Rick. I don't see any particular segment different. I think there is just a matter of perspective on the year. When we look out and talk to customers, we do see some improvement in the second half, but still we see, as we said, a little bit trending down based on all the factors we cited. I think that if you go case-by-case, I think you got -- memory is technology, but not a lot of investment for capacity. I think foundry continues to be relatively strong, and we'll see logic probably continuing, although probably cooling off a little bit in the second half. And that's how we roll up to the annual. As far as share, our share continues to be very strong. I think that we see, from overall perspective, some opportunity actually to gain share this calendar year. We've got some really strong product positions and making pretty good investments in close collaboration with our customers. So we don't see share overall for KLA-Tencor to be a -- and obviously, you have to work for it, but we're not modeling any share loss through this year. And as we talked about last year, we actually did quite well in share, 2012.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to dive into that a little more because there's just such a difference between what you're saying and what others are seeing. Rick, do you think that there's been any change in your view that process diagnostic is still 15% of wafer fab? Is there -- can you maybe discuss what could push that up from here and what might be pushing that down, if only in the short term?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure, Tim. I think that the -- I guess, overall, we model memory to be improving in terms of adoption of process control, but not at the level of what we see for foundry and logic. So the degree there is a mix change in the near term that would mean that process control, overall, would probably not see as much appreciation as somebody that was more exposed to memory. However, for the -- overall, for the year, we think that foundry continues to invest, although the build-out of 20 nanometers is -- largely people are making those investments, but we think that will possibly be light participation, with more customers gearing up for the transition to below 20, whether it's 16 or 14, depending on who. So yes, there is a bit of a mix in the near-term scenario, but long term, overall capital intensity for foundry is, I think -- probably we're modeling it pretty consistent with others. And I think that process control for foundry continues to be very strong.","Operator","Next, you have a question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rick, just to follow up on that. Your foundry booking for June quarter looks like it could be the lowest over the last 3 years. And is it just purely a timing issue? Or do you see your foundry customers actually stalling the spending because of the planar\/FinFET transition? Or maybe you've not decided which way to go?","Richard P. Wallace","No, I think right now, what we're seeing is, in the June quarter, that we do see some -- a bit of pause in some of the foundry business. There is another factor, which maybe we talked about in the prepared remarks and I can address a little bit. We did guide shipments to be quite a bit up in this quarter, up to in the $740 million, $800 million. And part of what that is, is there are a number of tools in that, that are early in the development and that will -- it will take us a little while to revenue -- recognize those. And those probably will not fall into the June quarter. And in some cases, what we're looking at for those tools is those are more oriented towards future development process technology nodes. So there may be investment leading into the FinFET development in the foundry space that maybe offsets that a little bit, but we don't expect to see that necessarily be as large in the June quarter as what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Then we see resumption of that spending in the later part of the calendar year.","Operator","Next, we have a question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So just to follow up with that. For those developments today that you're saying those are targeting 20-nanometer, are they 14-nanometer and are they specifically for foundry? And I guess on your outlook for the year, are you not factoring in much 20-nanometer investment in the second half of this year?","Richard P. Wallace","No, not a lot of investment on the second half for 20, still some, but I would say a little broader participation. So maybe some of the players that haven't been as active in 20 already will participate, but we're modeling relatively modest on a compared basis. And toward the end of the year, more investment associated with maybe the later phases of 20 and some of the sub-20 work.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on your view on the order trends for the second half of the year. It sounds like you said you're still planning for orders in the second half to increase from foundry and also to be up from memory, but logic might be down a bit. So I just want to clarify, despite your more cautious view on CapEx this year, are you still planning for, I guess, total second half orders to be flat or slightly up versus the first half?","Richard P. Wallace","We see second half being better, but I'd say when we modeled earlier in the year and we were -- the bias was a little bit more toward down 5%, our bias for the year is still down, but a little bit toward the down 10%, which I think is consistent with actually most of our peers but one. And what we see in that is that you see a second half comeback, as we said, a little bit more investment happening, primarily on a broad-based foundry investment on the second half. So memory, but not a lot of capacity in memory, more capacity-related, and logic perhaps cooling in the second half. The other thing that affects us a little bit about, too, is we're looking some of the ancillary markets like the wafer manufacturers, which we have not seen a lot of investment out of them. And historically, if you look at past cycles, we would have seen more investment out of our wafer guys. We just don't see that happening and that's usually an early indicator overall capacity buys. So we don't see it happening and that kind of aligns with our thinking of overall trends for the year.","Operator","Next, we have Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, I just wanted to get a sense from you. You made comments around second-half growth in the foundry bookings, but just wanted to understand the magnitude of upside or growth that you are expecting. If you look at the first-half bookings run rate, I mean, your bookings would have to almost double in order for overall bookings to be down slightly compared to last year. So I'm just wondering what kind of magnitude of bookings growth you are expecting in the second half.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, well, obviously, we don't guide beyond the quarter. But I can tell you, as we model the overall year and you can do the math, as you said, on how you look at it, as you model the overall year, we think the capital intensity investment for the industry is, on a relative basis, pretty flattish. The overall CapEx, down anywhere from flat to down 10%, and we're saying it's more the down 10%. But we do see mix coming back a little bit and a little bit strength in the foundries and -- breadth in the foundries and strength in memory. And so that's kind of how we get that memory more on technology than on overall capacity buys at this point. And logic, flattish but maybe a little bit more first-half loaded than the second half. And obviously, if you want to walk through the models, our guys can do that with you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Rick, your September quarter has historically been a down quarter given how your fiscal year ends in June. Given the kind of picture that you painted us -- painted for us, and I appreciate all the details and sincerity, how should we think about seasonality and historical trend playing into the September quarter?","Richard P. Wallace","Again, that's -- I appreciate the desire to get that. We don't have a good view of September right now. We're still working on finalizing what June looks like and that's why there's such a large range on there. I'd also offer that at SEMICON West, we'll have a much better picture and be able to talk in more detail. But you're right, we do view -- September, historically, has been seasonally softer for K-T, and counterbalanced by what's often a very strong end to the calendar year. So we don't know exactly where we're going to get it in the calendar year quarter-by-quarter, but we're modeling. If we see this overall CapEx down 10%, then it kind of fits with our thesis that process control at least hold our overall intensity and probably outperform, but it'll come later in the calendar year.","Operator","Next, we have a question from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, so in terms of your incremental minus 5 to -- flat to minus 5 to flat to minus 10, is there one specific segment which has -- you've become more incrementally more cautious on?","Richard P. Wallace","What we really haven't seen is any strength in the non -- in the stuff that's outside of the core, so some of the manufacturers of wafers, for example. We do see that, overall, being softer. And the first half is probably lower than we thought it would be in January, and so that -- you still have some comeback in the second half, but it won't compensate for some of the softness we're seeing now.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one more question is, I mean, how much of your -- the difference between you and your competitors, is timing of ordering. I see that your guidance is pretty similar to lithos, where the guidance for the full year is down, whereas I think the depth and edge, those segments seems to be stronger. Is there some kind of a timing issue that litho and process control order has happened earlier and there is probably some capacity out there, and there's more of capacity orders right now that's making some of your competitor looks better?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, there's certainly -- there are players that are more attuned to capacity buys and the regard -- I would say that it is probably more similar to litho. Our profile looks a little bit like it, but perhaps for slightly different reasons. From our standpoint, it is true that if you look on balance, there is more investment at the very front end of a node than there is on the later parts of the node until they get on to the next node. And that's what we're suggesting is we're seeing more investment continuing and probably phase shifts it a bit. That's not true of all our products, and some of our products are sensitive to capacity and those we do not see a lot of capacity being added, for example, I go back to the wafer manufacturers, but on balance, that's true. The other thing that's happened is we're in a relatively soft period for reticle inspection, which historically would have been stronger through a period of technology development. And that has been softer due to this continuation in double patterning and quad patterning, not stressing the map [ph]  shops as much. So that's the other counterbalance to it.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one final question on ASML suggesting that they have integrated metrology on CD measurement and overlay. And I'm just wondering to what extent that is an additive market or how much of that cannibalizes your overlay market. I think CD measurement is probably not that significant because it's only for FICD. But it's definitely on overlay, you have a very strong market share. I'm wondering if you are seeing any kind of impact in that part of the business.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I think as far as integrated go, customers are interested, and have been for many years, in the concept of integrated metrology, but still not very clear on exactly how to use it. And that comes from the fact that you're then at basically one unit per track step or pair, which is a higher concentration. And it's not clear that that's either economical or feasible from a production worthiness perspective because if it goes down, you can bring down the line. But there is certainly interest in increasing the capability around registration control as people push multiple patterning. So we do think that the market is growing significantly and there is going to be plenty of room for alternative approaches to dealing with that. As far as the CD control, we're actually very happy and have made tremendous progress in terms of market share there, where we did not have a strong position and have recently won planar record buys at a number of key customers for providing optical CD control. So we're really pleased with that part of our business.","Operator","The next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wanted to -- had a question. There's a view out there, Rick, that 28-nanometer could have more longevity, as customers seem to be at the cusp of deciding on 20-nanometer or sub-16-nanometer by skipping a node. So as they try to debug some of the processes, do you think this flux is causing you to be more biased toward the negative side? And hopefully, if they get more clarity on it, that probably we could see much more uptick from the foundries?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I'd say there's -- Jagadish, very good observation. Two thoughts on that. One is, I think in many ways we're saying the same thing, is that we do see some question about the strength of 20-nanometer based on interest we're seeing in sub-20, which would, by extension, extend the life of 28. The other thing is that even though 28 has been -- there are people that are successful at 28, there's still a broader market, broader participation by other foundries in 28 that creates other opportunities. So we do see some strength in that build-out. And I suspect that there's still some process changes, even on 28, that will create some opportunity for us as well. But yes, that is the question, is how big the participation and how quick people go to 20 or if they skip it or not. Should that change, I think it does improve our prospects for the calendar year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we have a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, maybe if you could give a little bit of color in terms of the 3D NAND opportunity and whether you see that transition as being, I guess, an inflection point or a step-up in terms of the memory adoption of more process control, given some of the challenges in that type of manufacturing?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, there's a couple of opportunities that 3D presents and some are less obvious than others. One is, obviously, as you can imagine, trying to find defects requires some new capabilities for people as they deal with 3D. And finding them is just one part of it, then validating that they actually found them. There's been a lot of work going on to try to support customers as they do that, as they try to make that manufacturing process production-worthy. The other thing is there's plenty of opportunity there for some of this optical CD measurement that I talked about, and we're doing well in that regard. The third one is because many of these structures are multilayered within a process tool, there's actually a pretty good opportunity for bare wafer inspection, to make sure that the cleanliness of those tools is at a higher level than historically. So we are seeing increased opportunity for bare wafer inspection to support 3D, which is an additive bonus to -- perhaps counterintuitive to the opportunities of 3D.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a real quick follow-up. What kind of percentage in terms of dollar opportunity from what you're doing today in planar versus what 3D could be like, I guess, on a percentage basis of an increase in the TAM?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think if you think about process control intensity being -- I don't want to get into specific numbers, but let's say memory process control intensity is 50% of what foundry is, this probably takes it to 70%, 75% of what foundry is.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","It's B. Riley & Co. now. First, you commented on the capital intensity that memory adoption is not as high as logic and foundry, but isn't the capital spending still much greater than 50% for foundry and logic this year?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. No, overall, that's right. I think that the memory investment for the year is certainly not -- you go back in time and it was actually driving a lot of the CapEx. But we are in a momentary point in time where there's probably, on a relative basis, even for us, we're seeing -- we're looking at June, thinking 33% or 1\/3 of our business is going to come from memory. And you have to go back several years to the market split used to be 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3. And I now I think we're in this temporary phase where memory is 1\/3 of what we're going to be in terms of opportunity, which means it's probably more than that of the overall market, and we think that reverts as we get to the second half of the year, which is why we think we'll see more strength in the second half.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","And then usually, I think we're always worried about utilization rates for other types of tool. Is there any kind of situation where there was too much buying of your equipment early, like 2012?","Richard P. Wallace","Not really. I mean, I think the question often becomes, can it get redeployed on additional nodes? And so part of what drives our product roadmap is the -- is a slight difference, is you could redeploy inspection and metrology capacity towards advanced nodes with some level of success. So part of our challenge is always to create more capability in the next generation to make a compelling case for customers to upgrade or go to new products. Otherwise, you would see that. You would see the transition of some of that, especially as yields got very high on the older nodes. So I'd say that we are constantly -- and one of the products we just introduced, for example, in NanoPoint, is to extend the capability, provide a motivation for our customers to go to the next-generation technology. And we're seeing that bear out, but usually there's an adoption cycle of that.","Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","So just to clarify that answer, as my last question. If your tools weren't utilized for the manufacturing node, you'd see more redeployment to the next generation. Is that what I'm hearing?","Richard P. Wallace","It depends how big a transition the technology change is. And for example, 28 to 20 is too big a change. So if they were at 28, they're not going to do a great job at 20, except in the case where they -- it's probably more like litho. The very critical layers on 28 probably correspond better to the non-critical layers on 20, so there will be some. But that cycle has been going on for a while. But even in that case, if you can provide compelling reasons to upgrade, you can often get customers to make the transition.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We\u2019re here today to discuss first quarter results for the period ended December 30, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific time.

We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Wallace","","Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in our earnings call. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our refinancing and recapitalization announcement and the business highlights of the first quarter. Bren will then review the financial details of today\u2019s announcements followed by Q&A.","Today, as part of our ongoing activities focused on returning value to shareholders, KLA-Tencor is announcing our intention to recapitalize our balance sheet. These actions reflect management and the Board of Directors\u2019 confidence in our market leadership, business model and long-term growth strategies, as well as our leadership and strong commitment to delivering a high level of returns to stockholders.","Bren will have more details of the transaction, but in summary, what we\u2019re announcing today is proposed leverage recapitalization of KLA-Tencor, which would return approximately $4 billion to our stockholders. Subject to closing of the financial aspect of this initiative, we intend to issue a $16.50 per share special dividend.","We\u2019re also announcing that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase to the company\u2019s stock repurchase program by an additional 3.0 million shares of common stock. This increasing value add approximately $250 million based upon the closing cost of our common stock as of October 20, 2014.","We believe our capital structure strategy underscores our confidence and the strength of our strategic objectives in our business model, but also the strength of our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve invested in our business and executed our growth strategies over time, we have experienced strong cash generation in excess of what believe is necessary to fund our operations and investing our future growth. We intend to continue to execute our business model and strategies, manage our company profitability and provide a high level of value to our stockholders.","Turning now to highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2015; September quarter revenue and earnings per share results finished as expected. The new orders in Q1 ended below the guided range at $567 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers ended below the original forecast for the quarter.","We believe this is due to two factors. First, there are many challenges associated with adopting the new technologies required to fabricate leading-edge transistor architectures. Second, tighter order lead times have become the norm in our industry today. And this coupled with a concentrated customer base is resulting in increased quarterly order variability.","We currently expect a rebound in foundry order levels in the December quarter as customers move closer to the implementation of new capacity additions in leading-edge foundries that are expected to begin in the first half of calendar 2015.","Although the September quarter bookings profile reflects an unusually low level activity from one of our foundry market customers in terms of next-generation FinFET build out, it\u2019s clear that the battlefield for sub 20-nanometer competition has been formed with many players positioning to meet next-generation production ramp schedules.","Recall the near record level of foundry orders booked by KLA-Tencorp in the single customer in the June quarter, with delivery dates for these orders slated for early 2015. These orders combined with a strong foundry order forecast for KLA-Tencor in the current quarter indicate the more aggressive pace of investment in FinFET capacity has begun.","FinFET processes are extremely complex and challenging to bring to market. Our customers rely on KLA-Tencor to help address the ongoing yield issues associated with these new technologies.","Logic orders came in largely as expected in the September quarter. Memory orders grew sequentially in the September quarter, with roughly a 50-50 split between DRAM and NAND Flash. DRAM customers are continuing their investments in 2x nanometer technology conversions. In addition to new capacity activity, the Flash demand continues to be focused on planar NAND.","For KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition.","Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the December quarter booking profile represents a meaningful pick up in order activity, largely driven by the leading-edge foundries as they move to prepare FinFET production capacity ahead of anticipated end customer demand in 2015.","We expect December order quarter bookings to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, up approximately 40% at the midpoint from September. Guidance for revenue in the December quarter is in the range of $620 million to $700 million, and non GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.70 in the quarter.","December quarter EPS guidance does not consider the impact on other income and expense and tax rate related to the proposed recapitalization transaction. However, upon completion of the proposed transaction later in the quarter, we plan to update guidance to reflect the earnings impact of the proposed transaction.","So, to wrap it up, KLA-Tencor is acknowledged as a the market leader in process control with a proven track record of consistently delivering industry-leading revenue growth, profitability and strong cash flow generation. KLA-Tencor\u2019s strong business model and the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plans enable us to continue to invest in our business at a high level to fuel our growth and support our customer\u2019s needs. We\u2019re also delivering meaningful returns to stockholders as exemplified by today\u2019s announcements.","Today, the factors driving our growth in market leadership remain favorable. We\u2019re confident in KLA-Tencor\u2019s ability to drive innovation and help customers addressing the increasing cost and complexity of computing at the leading-edge.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bren for more details on today\u2019s announcement and his perspective on the quarter.","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Today, we\u2019re very pleased to announce new dimensions to our capital allocation strategy. To support our ongoing commitments to return capital to stockholders, we plan to pursue a $4 billion leverage recapitalization featuring a $16.50 per share special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately 2.75 billion.","The special cash dividend would be an addition to our regular $0.50 per share quarterly dividend. The intended special cash dividend will be funded in part with the portion of cash on the company\u2019s balance sheet and in part with 2.5 billion incremental debt that will be added to the balance sheet. Our regular $0.50 per share quarterly cash dividend is expected to be declared and paid following our regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting in November 2014.","In addition to the $16.50 per share special dividend, our Board of Directors has also approved an additional authorization of 3.6 million shares for our stock repurchase program, representing an additional $250 million increase over the $1 billion originally authorized in July. We expect to complete the new share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months.","Including the special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately $2.75 billion, the $250 million increase to the stock repurchase program announced today and the $1 billion stock repurchase program previously announced in July 2014, the total capitals will be directed to stockholders will be approximately $4 billion in aggregate. The aggregate value of the special dividend of approximately $2.75 billion includes the portion of the special cash dividend that could be payable to holders of outstanding equity award under the company\u2019s 2004 equity incentive plan.","This leverage recapitalization will add a more permanent tier of debt with longer maturity dates in our current nodes, thereby improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. As part of our recapitalization, we intend to issue incremental debt consisting of a pre-payable term loan facility which we intend to de-lever over the next three to five years and investment grade senior notes with staggered maturities.","We also expect to enter into revolving credit facility. An unprecedented lending environment coupled with what we expect to be a robust capital spending profile in our industry over the next few years has enabled us to undertake this program and borrow above our long run debt target of 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA leverage to opportunistically optimize the company\u2019s capital structure and enhance total stockholder returns over our base plan.","We intend to maintain an investment grade rating. As Rick mentioned, our strategic positive remains strong, and we\u2019re delivering superior cash flows and financial results. We entered the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 with over $2.9 billion of cash and investments with roughly two thirds of our through cycle cash flow generated in the U.S.","As we look ahead, the near-term priorities for domestic cash include about $500 million of cash to fund operations on an ongoing basis. We\u2019ll continue to execute the same strategies that have enabled us to sustain our market leadership and process control, deliver long-term revenue growth in excess of the market and deliver superior profitability and cash flows. As part of these market leadership and growth strategies, we\u2019re committed to continuing to invest at high levels in research and development and evaluating perspective strategic growth opportunities that are complementary to our model.","This is the formula for success that has served us well over the years in extending our market leadership, dealing strong cash flows and establishing KLA-Tencor among the leaders in returning value to stockholders.","Our strategies for growth are driven by goal to deliver better than industry average revenue across the multiyear cycle and earnings growth targeted at 1.5 to 2 times revenue growth over time. We believe today\u2019s news reflects our confidence in the prospects for continued successful execution of these strategies.","As we execute on these long-term growth strategies, we plan to deliver returns to stockholders via dividends, through stock repurchases and by reinvesting in the business and ways to deliver sustainable value. We see today\u2019s announcement as the next logical step in our ongoing efforts to drive stockholder value.","Turning now to more specifics on the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015; I\u2019ll provide summary highlight in my commentary on the call today, please refer to the supplemental materials we had posted in the Investor Relations page in our Web site for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter.","Revenue for Q1 was $643 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter above midpoint of the guided range at $0.47 per share. Non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.50 per share at our guided tax rate of 22%.","In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you\u2019ll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.04 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in today\u2019s press release.","New orders in Q1 were 567 million, below the guided bookings range for the quarter of 600 million to 800 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers originally scheduled to be placed in the September quarter were pushed out. As Rick noted, we believe the delay in orders from this customer for FinFET ramp is partially a timing issue with this customer providing shorter lead times from order placement to shipment than we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Calendar 2015 is expected to be a year of growth for the semiconductor equipment industry with multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading-edge capacity and foundry, logic and memory in the year. With that said, we continue to experience low order visibility with a limited number of customers placing sizeable orders comprising the majority of our forecast. And as these plans change, driven by yield issues or lead time commitments, the impact on quarterly forecast accuracy is significant.","Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the September quarter; foundry was 25% of new orders in Q1, and very low compared with recent history. In fact, orders from one of our foundry market leaders finished over $100 million below the original forecast, ending the unexpected low levels in Q1. Foundry demand is expected to rebound to 62% of orders in the December quarter. As Rick noted, the competitive battleground in next- generation foundry is taking shape. Incapacity plans for FinFET are lining up for the first half of calendar 2015.","As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a strong broad based foundry demand for 16 and 14 nanometer nodes. Memory was 46% of new system orders in September, up sequentially both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared to June. Logic was 28% of new orders in September above the original forecast for the quarter. Customer investments in technology of 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 66% of the orders we received in Q1.","Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 49%, reticle inspection was approximately 3%, metrology was 15%, service was approximately 30%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 3%. Total shipments in Q1 were 548 million and below the bottom end of the guided range of 600 million to 650 million as delivery timing for certain orders related the leading- edge foundry projects, originally expected to ship in the September quarter, shipped it into Q2 in early 2015.","This is consistent with the conditions we experienced in the March and June quarters. The shipment delivery dates for tools currently in backlog are featuring extended lead times, resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near-term. We expect shipments in Q2 to grow approximately 40% sequentially at the midpoint of December guidance. We entered the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $993 million of shipment backlog or orders that had not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months.","Our current shipment backlog is at historic high levels for the company, providing the baseline for strong shipment and revenue growth as we convert this backlog in the coming quarters; $173 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced, but had not yet have been find out by customers.","Turning to the income statement; the numbers show KLA-Tencor executed well operationally in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin, and EPS, all finishing in the upper end of the range of guidance. As I previously mentioned, revenue in September were 643 million, just about the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter. Gross margin was 55.6%; 100 basis points above the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter, in spite of the $91 million sequential decline in revenue.","Gross margin exceeded our expectations in the quarter due to lower than forecasted parts cost in our service business and a favorable product mix in Q1. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in December. Total operating expenses in the September quarter were 240 million, up sequentially about nine million compared with June, mainly due to higher employee-related cost in the quarter. Consistent with our expectations, prototype material costs for certain next-generation products are expected to be higher in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half. But the December quarter, we are modeling operating expenses to be between $236 million and $238 million.","Other income and expense was approximately $10 million in September, prior to the recapitalization, our expectation at OIE will be about 10 million in the December quarter. However, given the unknown currently surrounding the structure and timing of the proposed recapitalization, at this time we\u2019re unable to guide OIE for the December quarter. We plan to provide detailed guidance update some time later this quarter to reflect the impact of the transaction on OIE tax rate earnings per share.","Our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter, above our long-term planning rate of about 22%. We believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be 22%, given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013.","Given the low probability that this extension will occur in the December quarter, we are modeling a tax rate of 24% for the December quarter. Finally, net income for Q1 was 79 million or $0.47 per fully diluted share.","I\u2019ll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.94 billion, a decrease of 210 million compared with June. Sequential decline in our cash balances is largely due to staff repurchases and annual bonus payments in the quarter. Cash from operations was $35 million in the quarter. The sequential declining cash flow from operations in Q1 is consistent with seasonal trends and was driven in part by lower revenue levels as well as the timing of our annual bonus compensation payments in the quarter.","In the September quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased 125 million of our common stock. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under a 156 million. So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is, bookings are expected to be within a range of 700 million to 900 million, shipment guidance for the December quarter in a range of 740 to 800 million, revenue between 620 and 700 million, and EPS of $0.46 to $0.70 per share, exclusive of the impact of the recapitalization.","Once again, we plan to provide an update in the December quarter guidance that will reflect the impact of the proposed recapitalization concurrent with the currently scheduled closing of the transaction later this quarter.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call to questions and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question in one follow-up, given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. So, Mike, we\u2019re ready for your first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. Rick, can you just talk about briefly like why you chose to do a special dividend instead of buybacks, and what were the puts and takes in making the decision?","Richard Wallace","Hi. Well, I\u2019ll give an overview and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Bren to get the specifics. So look, the way we look at it, there are three uses of cash. And the primary use is to fund our organic growth and we fully satisfy that, and we continue to build upon that. The second is to look for accretive and enabling M&A. And we\u2019ve done those things and continue to evaluate those and we feel we can do them. And then the third one is returning cash to shareholders and in that we look for the most efficient way, an effective way to do that, considering a lot of factors including who our shareholders are. And also the size of the return and what\u2019s most efficient. And so, from that I\u2019ll hand it to Bren.","Bren Higgins","So I think anytime you consider a large return to capital, I mean certainly we start from an assessment of our business around how much cash can the business have, what kind of reserves do we need, also, the potential debt capacity of the company. And so as we looked at that and to Rick\u2019s point as we assessed our options, we clearly did not see at least for now, anything on the M&A front that looked as compelling to shareholder value is what we\u2019re doing here today.","But given the size of the transaction itself, the practice of trying to execute a share repurchase is difficult. There is a tender offer and the premiums and all those kinds of things, and I think it really comes back to Rick\u2019s point, who are our shareholders, what did they value? We think our shareholders value our dividend practice, our practice of returning cash, the ability to treat all shareholders the same, and the timeliness and efficiency of the execution.","There is a piece of this obviously, that is share repurchase that we will execute over time. We made the previous announcement back in July, up a billion dollars that which was executed a 125 million and we added another 250 to that. So we will be executing that over time as another component. There are I think different opinions on what\u2019s the best approach. I think it goes back to how we think about our business. How much cash do we need and ultimately we made the call to do it this way where we feel like we\u2019re optimizing between the two vehicles.","Farhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. And just one question in terms of the calendar first half of next year, what kind of pick up are you expecting in the first half of next year?","Richard Wallace","Well, as you know, we don\u2019t guide beyond the next quarter, but overall for calendar 2015, I think it is setting up nicely for heavily investment in FinFET across the board. And when we look at our foundry customers, really nobody is shipping products today on a large volume with FinFET devices. And I think by the end of calendar 2015, the expectation is there\u2019ll be multiple devices from multiple suppliers of FinFET technology. So that bodes well for investment.","So what we\u2019re anticipating, as we said for the December quarter is a pickup in investment associated with that. But then throughout 2015, the way the plans look and the way our customers are talking to us about it, I think we\u2019ll see multiple players supporting that ramp.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I think the only thing I would add to that is given the timing of the second half of the year to be delivering product, it does make sense that you start to see capacity ramping in the first half of the year. Certainly, we are driving our supply chain in building towards that expectation. And I think it lines up with the end market dynamics that Rick mentioned.","Farhan Rizvi \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","Your next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen","Thanks a lot guys. Two things; first of all, Rick, I\u2019m curious if you can talk about the FinFET timing issues and if it\u2019s possible to segment it out whether it\u2019s process-related or some of it is like customer-related IE, like your customers, a lot of obvious uncertainty out there. And so I\u2019m wondering whether you could segment the two, and then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Richard Wallace","Sure. From what we understand in talking to our customers, I think there is a desire by the end customers to get to the technology, but there is an inability right now in general to have a large scale deployment of technologies that are reliable enough to be deployed in high volume. So I think that that\u2019s really limiting. Like I said, we expect the first commercial devices to come out, consumer devices to come out by the end of the calendar year within that technology. But that\u2019s really only from one supplier.","The other ones are working through a number of issues and there are associated challenges with defect density but also structural reliability. And I think that for people that haven\u2019t done FinFET, it\u2019s turning out to be a very challenging process. So I think there is a lot of effort going on to deal with that. As you know there has been some success in 20-nanometer. So given that that\u2019s made it into the current product cycle, we\u2019re really talking about a next product cycle which I think is as soon as we expect to see volume, is mid calendar year of 2015.","So, as I said, we expect investment to be ramping in dealing with some of those challenges. But the people that are in front on FinFET struggle quite a bit getting yield on them and we were involved and work you through some of those challenges. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy. And I think that on the one hand we\u2019re enabling that but on the other hand, until it starts to work there\u2019s not going to be a lot of customer demands, not a lot to tape out. But then I expect to see an avalanche of demand once the process start working.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess, just a follow-up to the prior question about the decision to pay a special dividend. Why would you decide to do that when you\u2019re about to put up a quarter that where the guidance is definitely disappointing relative to what Street was thinking and you could have maybe bought stock back at a much, much lower price. I guess I\u2019m just wondering that calculus around paying that special dividend versus maybe doing an ASR post these results, something like that. Thanks.","Richard Wallace","Sure. Well, as you can imagine, this is Rick, I\u2019ll start with an overview and then let Bren fill it in. First of all, this wasn\u2019t a decision that was something about a near-term decision, that is a long-term decision around the capital structure of the company, something that they\u2019re working at for quite a while to figure out what is the right way to position the company and structure it. So it\u2019s independent of ups and downs of particularly the quarters and we certainly are market timers.","So we look at that, and we say \"What\u2019s the best way, what\u2019s the best capital structure?\" And then, in this case, there is a blend, but it\u2019s obviously greater in the special dividend and it\u2019s the most efficient way to be able to return cash to shareholders. If that was really thinking, it wasn\u2019t meant to be coincident with any particular quarter. It just happened to coincide.","Bren Higgins","The other thing I think I\u2019ll add is clearly the ability to finance this was driven by a very attractive debt market both in terms of rates, terms, and financial flexibility. Also, our view on being able to overshoot or go further than our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times leverage was also driven by our views of capital intensity and healthy capital spending environment over the next couple of years to enable us to de-leverage some of this debt we\u2019re taking on back to our target.","I\u2019ve been saying, I think for I think even going back to May and even in the SEMICON that we felt like it made sense for our company given the dynamics or secular dynamics or business model, the barriers to entry, our market share that more assertive capital structure would drive additional value to our shareholders. And so, this was a process, we made the share repurchase announcement. At the time, we said that that was the first step; this is the next step.","So we talk a lot already about the pros and cons of the vehicle, but at the same time I just want to give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen","Okay, Bren. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from C.J. Muse with ISI Group.","C.J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I could \u2013 I\u2019ll try to ask both my questions at once as they\u2019re partially related. I guess, first off, when you consider this special dividend, I\u2019m curious whether you focused it all on the M&A side or increased R&D. When I look at your relative to position to WFE over the last two years, you underperform by about eight points each year. I\u2019d would love to hear your thoughts on whether that was a consideration, and how you\u2019re going to rectify this relative underperformance that is going on at least for the last few years.","And then second part of the question is flexibility. If I look at you guys perform a post-transaction, roughly 20% debt to cap and roughly 2\/3rds of your free cash flow will cover interest and dividend. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s enough flexibility for what may come for what is still a cyclical industry. Thank you.","Richard Wallace","Yes. C.J., I\u2019ll take part of it and then again, Bren can look at it. Yes, we can talk about the relative performance. I think as you\u2019re well aware, we have a \u2013 we\u2019re biased towards increased adoption in logic and foundry and less so in memory, although memory is increasing. And what we\u2019ve seen this year clearly is that the memory investment has been higher than maybe anticipated originally and has continued to go up.","We expect that trend to reverse a little bit in 2015 where we do see the foundry customers increasing their investment, and in our expectations, memory will probably normally hold to what they\u2019re doing in 2014. So I think the mix becomes favorable for us. So we look at over the long-term.","The second part, I look at is a big change in the company and the industry I think has to do with \u2013 while the near-term volatility has increased, the longer term volatility has actually decreased because of the efficiencies associated with consolidation.","The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence is in our ability to service the debt and do everything else that we want to do, is a growing service business, which is much more aligned with what\u2019s going on in overall semiconductor manufacturing. And we just looked and we had seven consecutive growth of service business. And so we look at that as a business that can feel and can help dramatically service this debt. Bren, do you want to fill in?","Bren Higgins","Yes, C.J., I think you mentioned operational investment and I think that we have ramped up our investment to support our businesses. We have a product cadence that\u2019s 2XR competitors. So we believe we are investing enough in our business to be able to maintain our market position, and I think that the underperformance that you talk about is more driven by \u2013 it\u2019s the most sensitive element I think, and that is to explain more about customer mix than anything else.","From a flexibility perspective, we are using our offshore cash in this transaction. There is an unfunded revolver that\u2019s a component to it. We also plan to have about 500 million in the U.S. We\u2019re going to execute the share repurchase over time. And certainly there are some elements that provide flexibility there. As you know, covering this industry for a long time, this is not a capital intensive industry, and so, we don\u2019t need a lot of cash to run the business. We have to grow in service business, that\u2019s a bigger percentage of the revenue.","So, a much more comfortable, given the cyclical dynamics as well, I think we\u2019re much more comfortable with the risk profile. Then, our intent is to de-lever a significant portion of this rather quickly over the next couple of years. So, all that coupled with the cost of the debt plus the outlook that we have, we think that it\u2019s a prudent structure, and I think we expect our debt to be investment grade and I think that also reflects the structure and our ability to execute our strategies without the risk or the financial distress that affect \u2013 sometimes goes with that. So \u2026 ","Ed Lockwood","","Operator, next question?","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I had was just a follow-up on the special dividend recap question. Is it set as you had just pointed, you probably lived around and found out no suitable M&A candidates and decided this is a better way to return capital? And does it impact your 6.9% convert due in a few years? And I have a follow-up?","Bren Higgins","Again from the strategic perspective, we have looked at opportunities, we continued to look at opportunities to enable further growth and look for things that are going to be accretive to either our current business or places to grow. And when we evaluate that, we feel very well positioned with the product portfolio that we\u2019ve developed organically or through the M&A that we\u2019ve done in the past. And we\u2019ve said this on a number of occasions.","While we look, we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s so compelling that we wanted to move in the past, or would have and we always compare the returns that we\u2019d get from that from what returns we get from an action like this.","Second one is we still can do M&A. If there is M&A that\u2019s compelling and accretive over time, we\u2019re not limited to do that. And so, our view is this doesn\u2019t disable that option. It just would have to pass hurdles that we make it long-term accretive to our company and that\u2019s always been the case. So we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re limited in anyway from the deals that we anticipate might come our way as we look forward.","And then on the question on the 2018 debt, so that\u2019s straight corporate debt and option under consideration is do we \u2013 we may consider refinancing that. The financing is not complete yet, we don\u2019t want to get into the details ultimately of the various aspects of it. It\u2019s an option under consideration, and we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, it looks like there is lot of activity going on in the foundry side, besides the FinFET-related yield issues, have you guys seen any pick up or incremental sales for 28-nanometer or are you just focused mostly on 20, 16, 14 at this point?","Bren Higgins","We do have some forecast in this. We did expect in the second half to see some incremental 28-nanometer activity. We didn\u2019t see that in the September quarter. We do expect some of that business in the December quarter. I think some of the lithography orders happened in the September quarter, and I think just given general lead time dynamics that would imply that other tools will follow. So we do expect some of that business. I thought we\u2019d see some of that in September and it looks like I\u2019m going to see maybe more of it in September \u2013 December quarter now.","Richard Wallace","Yes, clearly there are players that haven\u2019t participated with that as a leading-edge node for them that have come to us for support and help, and to Bren\u2019s brands point, we expect to see that because as you know, that\u2019s the node that\u2019s probably generating a lot of the revenue and cash flow for the industry right now, not the very leading-edge stuff.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, Rick, Thanks Bren.","Richard Wallace","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Bill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling on behalf of Harlan. Congratulations on the recapitalization program. The question is actually more about the outlook particularly in the 2015. Wondering, with typically long lead times orders in hand, coupled with orders you expect in December, how do you see 2015 playing out in terms of first half, first second half? I understand \u2013 I\u2019m not looking for a forecast, but how do you see that playing out. And then I have a follow-up question.","Bren Higgins","So, Bill, I think the first half given the earlier comments, we think the first half should be strong given the ramp we expected associated with 16, 14 nanometers. Beyond that, though \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to guess, I think we\u2019re consistent with everybody else. We see it as a year growth as we said in the prepared remarks. In the first half, we\u2019re certainly building to support a strong shipment profile through the first half.","Bill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And I guess the second part is, I guess, should we expect with some customers that the sort of lead times would be I guess become a new norm or is there something else that play, I\u2019m just kind of curios in your thoughts on where the typical lead times would be going between the key foundry?","Bren Higgins","Lead times have been coming in over the last few years. I think one of the byproducts of the mobility-driven cycle that we\u2019ve been in since 2010 is because it\u2019s consumer-centric. Our customers are more sensitive to consumer dynamic. They have less lead time, and so some of that lack a visibility passes through. It tends to be customer-specific. As we saw on the June quarter, we booked a significant amount of business in the foundry from a customer its end of the lead times. And I think based on another customer that we expect to see some activity from here coming up to support the ramp we talked about. The lead times are pulling in.","So it tends to vary across customers. But over time I think we\u2019ve seen them shrink. I mean, we\u2019re still sitting, I think we ended the quarter around five months a backlog, but it isn\u2019t six to seven months of backlog. And as we model it going forward, we model somewhere between four and five months generally. It does mean that we carry more inventory to be flexible, and that\u2019s certainly a dynamic that we has changed in terms of how we manage the company and the business. But we need to be able to respond and these are big orders from single customers and so we have to be sensitive and flexible to their plans.","Richard Wallace","And I think in general, Bill, as you know at the industry has transitioned much more of consumer-orientation for devices, and that drives the business. It\u2019s our customers don\u2019t really have a lot of visibility? So they\u2019re asking us to be responsive to their need to respond quickly. And I think in exchange for that, what we get is pretty close collaboration on their needs. We just don\u2019t get great inside entertaining largely because in many cases they are not sure.","So we have a lot of provisional plans that change pretty quickly and we try to synchronize those, but it\u2019s a challenge because the end markets move and the players are all trying to be positioned to take share when it\u2019s available to them. So we have to support that and to Bren\u2019s point, we\u2019ve taken on some inventory to be able to do that.","Bill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks for that color, and good luck.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC","Thank you, very much. Rick, you talk about next year \u2013 one of your peers talk about next year up, 5% to 10%. Let\u2019s say if the CapEx next year is up 5%, where do you think your revenue can track in that environment?","Richard Wallace","I\u2019ll give that to Bren.","Bren Higgins","So, Mahesh, I think a lot of it depends on the customer mix. I think after two years where we had pretty heavy memory spending, I think, underperformance relative to the market, I think with a ramp of a new technology we think that we should be able to go with the market in the next year. That certainly have, we\u2019re modeling it. But I think that\u2019s the more sensitive item. I mean, over the last couple of years I think it\u2019s been just a fundamental delay I think around some of the new technologies, whether on the NAND side or even in the foundry. And certainly that\u2019s put pressure on process control because the customer buying patterns are typically heavier when they\u2019re ramping technology.","So, given the assumption of the ramp into next year, we do believe that next year positions as for its growing at least that the market rate, and perhaps faster if process control intensity moves the way we think they\u2019re going to move on these new technology.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC","And the second question on the debt. I\u2019m assuming that this is a special dividend and you\u2019re paying the basis. So, it\u2019s going to be tax-free to the investors. And also if you can give us some math around why do you need 2.5 billion of debt to fund this and because you have so much pretty good amount of cash in U.S.?","Bren Higgins","Yes. So the dividend versus return of capital calculation, which gets in whenever you pay a large special portion of it is dividend, and based on the tax retainer in over time, a piece could be return to capital. We don\u2019t have the specifics on that to share with you today. We\u2019ll share with that with you when we ultimately get where we pay the special. So that\u2019s how that works.","On the amount of debt, the way we thought about it was how far, how much debt could we borrow, we want to maintain investment grade profile as we said. We also had a plan around share repurchase. And so, once we pay the special and then go through the share repurchase commitment, we will have the U.S. cash number right around 500 million. And then most of \u2013 the way I am thinking about over time, the way we will drive this is our free cash flow into the U.S. will pay our ongoing dividend, and then the remainder will be targeted towards de-leveraging back to our long-term target to 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. I think the overall scope was driven by what\u2019s prudent for us, and also, clearly we thought it was important to maintain investment group profile through this.","Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Bren Higgins","","Welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello, your line is open.","Ed Lockwood","Okay, operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham","Great, thanks for taking my question. So first question, we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of activity by (indiscernible) around the 10-nanometer logic process right now. And I\u2019m little surprised at your mask inspection order is low this quarter, I would suspect that some of those guys who start to order mask inspection tool for 10 nanometer. Can you give some color around that where is mask inspection and do you expect incremental order around 10-nanometer on mask inspection number one and then relate to that as, do you expect ramp up in those 10-nanometer activity to benefit you in 2015?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Edwin it\u2019s a good question. So mask inspection particularly around the mash up in your lumpy business, we had a decent quarter in June and we have a forecast for decent quarter in December. So there is some lumpiness to the order profile. As you might recall, and we\u2019re fairly open with this, we did book for a leading logic manufacture, we did both in multiple set of mash ups rules to support the 10-nanometer node with those tools shipping over the course of 2015, so with a lot of it in the first half of 2015.","So, there is some activity there. I think we\u2019ll start to see more of that activity as we move forward. I don\u2019t know how much of it we\u2019ll see in December. But clearly that\u2019s an aspect obviously of this transition to 10, but very limited activity on 10. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll start seeing orders for 10-nanometer beyond what we\u2019ve seen in very early development stuff, I don\u2019t think you will see any meaningful orders until we get closer to the end of next year.","Richard Wallace","And to that point, the existing capability that we have can support the pilot and R&D work. And given the fact that there are few sub 20-nanometer designs working anywhere except for some that one customer that then there is a lot of, there is capacity in the system to handle things until we see very ramp up of 14, 16, that will start to consume some capacity. And then the 10 is really been as Bren said in the path finding usage for the reticle tool.","So, (indiscernible) is just not going to \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be lumpy but it\u2019s not going to be eminent given the 10 nanometer so far out.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham","I see, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just talk about your commentary on the first half of 2015, you said strong driven by the 16, 14 nanometer investment from your customer. What about the memory side? Are we at least \u2013 are you seeing any subsiding in investment memory or do you think that we remain strong in the first half or is it more called back-half loaded in the memory side. What color can you provide to us? Thank you.","Richard Wallace","Yes, I\u2019ll give my perspective, and Bren can way in. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of expectations of the building. I think that the strength and memory probably continues through 2015 at some level, probably not growing from here though. And most of the investment in Flash has been, as we talked in the past, plainer than 3D, there have been some in 3D but I think 3D is yet to come and that will be dependent on a number of factors, although we\u2019re participating in that.","And then the DRAM side, we do see technology investment going and there are definitely some capacity ads being pursued. So I think memory, I don\u2019t see a big difference between Q1 and Q2, or I\u2019m sorry, first half or second half of 2015 for that. As you know, we don\u2019t really forecast that far out into \u2013 our visibility is pretty limited in terms of exactly where things are going to fall. So we struggle to predict much beyond what we\u2019re going to see in December.","Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham","Great, that\u2019s actually very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik \u2013 Citigroup","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and then congratulations with the team with the special dividend. And the comment on FinFET push outs are quite understandable given your peers, (indiscernible) also talked about the uncertainty in the foundry markets. My question is on the lead times, Rick, and then for the same lines as Tim was alluding to. So if your customer\u2019s customers, they have to make their devices, let\u2019s say September next year, when is the latest pick in order of your (indiscernible) I\u2019m just trying to gauge if there is further risk in these bookings pushing out into the March quarter given your lead times that longer than your peers. And then, I have a follow-up.","Richard Wallace","Yes, I think, given what we\u2019re seeing, I think that there is a sensitivity clearly to the end market dynamics there and I expected \u2013 frankly, I expected the orders in September. So I have some orders forecasted in December. And certainly that\u2019s the plan based on what we see today. But it does as we\u2019ve seen it has been a little bit fluid. I think given the calendar timing that we\u2019ve talked about and roughly three month cycle times on devices, you really have to start I think putting that capacity in place in the March and June quarters be able to deliver those schedules.","And so that\u2019s I think the calendar, that our cadence that we\u2019re looking at in terms of expected delivery. But could it be a situation where I get very short lead times, I guess I get orders from customers and they turn around and run shipments in a couple of weeks. That could happen. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it does at some level, but this is \u2013 we\u2019re trying to give you as much guidance as we get based on the conversations we\u2019re having with the customer. And certainly, we\u2019re positioned to be able to respond with the flexibility to be able to deliver in a meaningful way end of the first half of the year.","Bren Higgins","Yes, until the point of \u2013 if you might have last two quarters, [we missed] (ph) low in terms of the midpoint and the June quarter, we miss high and then this low. So we\u2019re not very good at forecasting the next 90 days. And so, we really think about it in a longer term basis and the way I think about it, how it\u2019s adoption relative to our model and expectation and how we\u2019re doing relative to share.","And timing is something we have less influence over. But certainly from an adoption standpoint, we\u2019re seeing it. I think 14 and 16 will be good adoption for \u2013 we\u2019ll see strong adoption for process control, but we\u2019re not seeing it yet because that investment is not there. I think our market share continues to be strong. But until they place few orders, we don\u2019t know. So, it is true, we\u2019re going to be I think short term very bald all in terms of the ins and outs.","Atif Malik \u2013 Citigroup","Got it. And then as a follow-up, you guys talked about the 2D NAND investments are more dominant right now than then CD investment. Could you rank for us the reason for that? Is it that economics of CD are not at par with 2D or that\u2019s yield-related or just memory makers are just trying to keep a tight supply\/demand balance as 3D could add more depth in the market?","Richard Wallace","Well, clearly, there is a continuum of process maturity for the different providers. Right, yes. People that are already yielding devices and enable the ship and shipping in small volume, the other still in development, you have others early on development. So, I think it really ranges whereas 2D capacity is much broader. So, to the degree there is market demand for NAND. I think there is a big opportunity for everybody to participate in that. So, you\u2019re going to see planar NAND continue.","I do believe that people have underestimated the challenges in 3D both in NAND and also in FinFET, in terms of integration and yield and some of that we can help with and some of that\u2019s just debugging the processes. So, when there is a robust market environment, I think many of our customers will produce the products that they can produce. But the crossover plain, once the 3D is working of 3D flash is going to be compelling as well.","But it\u2019s got working in get to economics that makes sense. And we anticipate as soon as that happens in calendar 2015. But it\u2019s kind of a bit of both, the economics don\u2019t work, the demand isn\u2019t there but if it does work, there is a lot of interest in the customers for it.","Atif Malik \u2013 Citigroup","All right, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Chen with UBS.","Stephen Chen \u2013 UBS","Thanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just a follow-up question on the recapitalization, did the company consider a management buyout in perhaps seeking shares from the put and take and why not just the management buy out here?","Richard Wallace","No. We didn\u2019t consider. This was given our situation that wasn\u2019t something we consider. What we considered was what\u2019s a prudent level of debt that the company should be taking on to optimize our capital structure and then what\u2019s the best way, the most efficient way to return cash to shareholders after we\u2019ve gone through and evaluated uses one and two of cash, which is invest in our business, look at accretive M&A or enabling technology. But no, we didn\u2019t, we weren\u2019t looking at management buyout.","Bren Higgins","I think when you have a business like ours that has strong technology position, a differential margins, the ability to invest and therefore generate strong operating margins and a strong cash flow profile. I think you take that and you cover it with, what we clearly see our changes in the mix that of our industry that lends itself to I think a more predictable earnings stream overtime.","And so, business like that certainly has the capacity to carry more debt and to Rick\u2019s point, when you look at the first two considerations which we work through, at least for now, as we saw this is the best opportunity to deliver incremental value to our shareholders as we execute what we believe is a very solid plan going forward.","So that was the thought process. And again, the level of debt determined by our goal of what makes sense for our business as exhibited by the investment grade profile that we have and then obviously how do we move forward with it?","Stephen Chen \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks for that, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the ongoing business, so it looks like you\u2019re seeing the improved gross margins in both the September and December quarter, I missed the main driver that got you back into the gross margin range in September, does it \u2013 the period that you\u2019ve overcome those issues that occurred in the June quarter? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","Yes. The June quarter I had a couple of issues on revenue mix where some of the tools that came in on the revenue side had a weaker revenue mix profile. And I also had higher than expected cost in my service business. And so that drove one-time weakness, if you\u2019ll, into the June quarter. I think we saw a very normal gross margin structure play out as we went into this quarter, something more consistent with what we\u2019ve seen historically and consistent with our model.","So the mix turned out to be a little bit more favorable, and I think the dynamics I saw on the service business corrected and it\u2019s more consistent with our expectation for that. So \u2013 and I think as we look into the December quarter, the same dynamics play out.","Stephen Chen \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks, Bren.","Bren Higgins","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good evening everyone. This is Sean on for Ruben. I just wonder if you could give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin, gross margin profile for 2015, given the ramp that you\u2019re seeing for 16 and 14 and then just opportunities for expansion headwinds there, just some kind of directional indication of how things could play out.","Bren Higgins","Yes. The gross margin profile on our latest products that we\u2019ve introduced is actually \u2013 is very solid and very consistent with our historical pattern. We believe we\u2019ll see incremental gross margins between 60% and 70% going forward through 2015. And so, I think we\u2019re very well positioned as we see this pick up in business into the first half of the year for very good gross margin performance and very consistent with our historical model.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, and if we get the \u2013 you talked a little bit about ongoing focus on investment in the business, I\u2019m just trying to think about your OpEx levels into 2015, is this something that will continue to grow, how do we think about the magnitude of that growth or whether it\u2019s roughly consistent with where we see it currently?","Bren Higgins","Well, the first half of this fiscal year, the September quarter and the December quarter coming up, I expect it to be a higher OpEx level than we expected in the second half. And that was driven by some programmatic timing on some next-generation programs. So I think the second half of the year comes down from the first half, I\u2019m modeling the year right now, the fiscal year around 935 million, so given the performance in Q1, and what we guided for Q2 does imply somewhere around that $230 million range in the March and June quarters.","And so, our OpEx levels are really dependant on what\u2019s required to support our roadmaps. And I think we\u2019re not necessarily on where the revenue level is. So if the business is stronger, I don\u2019t think it changes our OpEx all that much, it turns out to be marginally weaker. I don\u2019t think it changes that much either. So it\u2019s really driven by the business requirements in maintaining the differentiation that we need to support the gross margin profile that enabled that investment.","Richard Wallace","Yes, just to add to that; one of the big initiatives we have been investing in this is what we call the 5D solution for lithography from multi-patterning, and well, we\u2019re seeing little bit of revenue from those efforts. I think that\u2019s an investment that will show up in future years as we continue to build out the suite of products and solutions we have to support multi-patterning going forward.","So that\u2019s part of the step up in the increase, but to Bren\u2019s point, we\u2019re looking to don\u2019t see dramatic increases beyond our current levels, but we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business as we go forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. That\u2019s it.","Operator","The last question is from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for squeezing in it. I have three really easy questions; one is, shipments last quarter you expected \u2013 you said you expected shipments to trend higher each quarter through the fiscal year. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the same thing today, but I wanted to verify that, that is the case. The second question is \u2013 I\u2019m just \u2013 if you could remind us how much cash you currently have off-shore? And then the third is, are you planning share count for the December quarter?","Richard Wallace","On shipments, we guided next quarter at 70 at the midpoint. And yes, I think given the commentary around the second or the first half of (technical difficulty) exact number, but about 1.2 billion at this point of the total of the 2.9. And share count that we\u2019re modeling is about 165 million in December.","Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Very helpful, thank you.","Richard Wallace","You\u2019re welcome.","Ed Lockwood","Operator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining, and we look forward to seeing you later on in this quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Thank you. Sir, please go ahead.","Kevin Kessel","Thank you, Christian, and welcome to today's KLA earnings conference call to discuss the results of the September 2019 quarter and outlook for the December 2019 quarter. I recently joined KLA, and today marks my first KLA earnings call. I'm glad to be here and look forward to meeting and talking with all of you over the quarters and years ahead.","Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon after the market close and they are also posted on the investor relations section of our website at ir.kla.com.","Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. The detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations including those from our recent Investor Day and Corporate Governance Information, as well as links the KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019.","Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosure in our SEC filings.

Rick?","Rick Wallace","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17th Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth, technology, leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance.","A result of strong customer pool for KLA solutions and focused execution despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments. As a global leader in process control and supplier of process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry.","Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio, and differentiated solutions that address our customer's most complex challenges is the recipe that sustained our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple megatrends driving demand across multiple product generations and numerous key industries.","Please turn the Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the Company this way for a long time, but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses.","The KLA operating model is essential to align the Company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.","Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that service our guide and drive our high performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent industry day, but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses including acquired ones with the focus on these key four objectives and it shows in our overall results published today.","Please turn to Slide 7 for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights of the quarter, I'd like to provide some high level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technology supporting 5G and artificial intelligence, growing semiconductor investment in China and continue device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment.","KLA strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum, we see due to support both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020, driven by investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and capacity additions.","Given the recent news of increased CapEx investments in 2019, at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019. With KLA semi-process control business inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment market and growing modestly compared to 2018.","Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, with customers now deploying Gen 5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the events notes.","Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020 as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly and KLA's advanced optical inspection platform is on the critical path to their success. The accelerated adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen 5 demand in the near term. Also last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new e-beam inspection platform in several years.","I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial to performance. KLA's differentiate e-beam inspection platform works with Gen 5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes. Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA.","In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better than expected demand in the September quarter, helping to contribute to the revenue upsides we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology roadmaps.","And finally KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi-process control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019, with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%.","Several factors drive growth and our service businesses including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the install base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service businesses providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business.","Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This was accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds in the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth.","Our focused on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day. 2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives.","Looking to 2020 and beyond, we're very excited about our process for growth and market leadership, building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets, and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 for review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also mark a new record for the Company.","Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was 1.413 billion, which was above the range of guidance of 1.31 billion to 1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 16.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 50% to 60%, driven by incremental revenue growth and stronger than expected semi-process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48, both of which were also above the range of guidance of 1.75 to 2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34, respectively.","Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter is both capital operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of 496 million and 464 million. We're proud of our financial results this quarter and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition.","A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders. On September 17th, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level, reflecting our confidence in our business strategy, the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it overtime as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders.","In terms of returning capital shareholders during the quarter, we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $220 million of common stock and also paid a $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon investing in restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitments to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced as the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program, resulting in $1.6 million available to repurchase under board authorization at quarter end.","Please turn to Slide 11 for review the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Revenue to the semi-process control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially on the backwards strength and foundry logic. As Rick discuss in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 is approved modestly driven by investments and easy and stronger foundry demand.","In addition, increased demand for native China is also contributing to this improvement, where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018. As I mentioned founders very strong at approximately 44% of semi-process control revenue up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September, down from 52% last quarter. Logic was 13% of total semi crosses control revenue versus 12% last quarter.","I'll turn now to the especially semiconductor process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and Edge solutions and fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million, up 3% sequentially. While we were encouraged by the market position of these products, SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market.","Despite these near term headwinds, we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis the calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB display and Component inspection segment was $179 million down 3% sequentially in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's Component inspection business.","Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products in region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 32%, patterning which includes radical inspection was 27%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%. PCB display and Component inspection revenue was 9%.","Other which includes Benchtop analytical instruments in the KLA pro mature product and enhancements business was 3%. Service is 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 27%, China was 24%, Japan was 15%, Korea was 14%, U.S. was 13%, Europe was 4% with the rest of Asia at 3%.","Please turn now to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income expense in September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11%, below our long term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in taxes are related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S.","Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward, you should continue to use 14% as a long term planning rate. Net income of $398 million and we had $160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","Please turn to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, total data $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies.","Please turn to Slides 15 to review free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we've averaged just over a 100% free cash flow conversion, and over the last 12 months has been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry leading gross margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.","Please turn to Slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitments to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout is increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years for the average price paying to repurchase shares been slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the Company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussion.","Please turn to Slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially roughly 4% of the midpoint in being range of 1.435 billion to 1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundries forecasted to be about 55% of semi-process control system revenue in the December quarter. To picking this rank we continue to see among our foundry customer base.","We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter, reflecting continued segments we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi-process control system revenue next quarter. For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half.","Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in the range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we're modeling them to be approximately 385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarters due principally to the timing of non-headcount related product engineering expenses for next generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower cost locations. We would expect to see an impact from this activity through 2020 with the return on these investments beginning in 2021.","As we move forward to the March quarter, our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of 370 million to 375 million, as product development expenses normalized to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately 38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%.","For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share account of approximately 159 million shares.","In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments and what remains in environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across the broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering strong relative performance and we're encouraged by the momentum we've seen in our business.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or have to have trajectories for the year, we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019.","As customers continue to progress through technology roadmaps and a strong demand environment, with improving competitive dynamics in diversify in demand. For memory, we expect a better year in 2020 as disciplined supply management in 2019 has approved the overall condition of both segments.","Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control and foundry and logic, improving process control intensity and memory and contributions from new products. Calendar 2020 is setting up another year relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we reported earnings for the December quarter.","I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin.","Kevin Kessel","Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up question.","With that, Christian, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Rick, I want to go back to one of your comments you made in your prepared comments about the Gen 5 optical inspection platform. You mentioned that you expect shipments to double in 2009 and to that still be a good growth driver in 2020. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense from you where in sort of the potential of that product cycle over time, do you think we are maybe using a baseball analogy might be the right way to look at it? And as you think about logic, foundry being strong next year, to what extent is that just a call or laundry, on logic foundry CapEx versus perhaps a Gen 5 product cycle that's still in the sweet spot and accelerating?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I think, if I thought about Gen 5 right now, and you want to use baseball at third inning, it's relatively early in the life. We were now in the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform and there is several iterations to follow. Engineering has been dedicated to that, but we're now starting to see broad adoption, and really the beginning of adoption in production where what we really have been dealing with for the most part in the last couple of years, was during the development cycle.","So, we're still early on and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become an HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is we seen more memory adoption in the Gen 5 memory we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we've originally envisioned.","Bren Higgins","John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about in our Investor Day, there is an application for radical qualification in the fabs for EUV radicals. So, where as we start to progress that use case is how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticle as they're being used in the wafer fab. So, the incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving, but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen 5 as it gets adopted.","John Pitzer","And Bren, maybe just for my follow-up, I want to go back to the operating model you shared at the Analysts Day, around op margin sort of bridge between now and 2023. You're already kind of the head of the revenue, op margin targets you gave in that model, both in the September quarter and in the December guide. And it sounds like December OpEx is unusually high for your comments and in general that op margin target that you gave only assumed incremental op margins to low end of your historical guidance. I hate the obsolete the model listen to quarter out, but can you talk a little bit about whether or not you think there's upside of conservatism to that model you gave at the Analyst Day?","Bren Higgins","Yes, John, it's a good question. I think one of the challenges and putting gathers as a model as it reflects a different mix of business that we have today, but also expected moving forward. So clearly in the September quarter and even in December, what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business. And that is beginning consistent with we've historical model that we've had out there.","So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction, you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we try to reflect was based on our expectations for growth overtime, what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are in embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business, we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it.","Operator","The next question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse","I guess first question on the foundry logic side of things. Can you speak to whether you're seeing increasing breadth of spending in that category and then really focused on the leading edge? And as part of that, if you could speak to also reuse that clearly was a headwind, basically from 20-nanometer down, but it sounds like 7 non-EUV progressing to 5 EUV, but that's a seismic shift here, but it's driving a real uptick in process control intensity. Would love to hear your thoughts on both of things?","Rick Wallace","I'll take the question and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry logic is, it's not particularly broadly expected to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts, design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there's so many different devices that are being introduced to these advanced nodes.","So, we don't suspect that they'll be that much. The other thing is we have new product cycle which really adding a lot of capability. So obviously, customers are always trying to optimize their capital, and we'll see them be as efficient as possible, but we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns, and all some of the additional challenges the advanced nodes are pushing. Even without brought EUV and once you brought out EUV get even more of that.","Bren Higgins","I think that the big difference between this nodes and let's say 20-nanometer, even down to 14, 16, is we're seeing much broader and market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing any reuse is that capacity is deploy to support all that activity. And a high mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product window. So it's a good story and we expect this node to have some legs and certainly the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and stronger expectations for that.","C.J. Muse","If I could speak in a quick second question, you talked about a return to 370, 375 OpEx in margin. I just curious, how should we think about potential synergies related to Orbotech as we move through 2020?","Rick Wallace","Yes, CJ, as I outlined at Investor Day is a number of activities that are happening and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer term structural cost reduction, namely, relocating some operations from subscale or higher cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint.","So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team, there's some incremental investment, but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range, I think we're in that range as we move in, based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line will be operating in that range as we move through the year with, the usual program development, expenses that could cause from one direction or the other.","I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range, as we move towards the end of the year and begin the year is probably at the higher end.","Operator","The next question is from Krish Santor from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Krish Santor","I just have a quick one, Rick. I know you've kind of spoke about how Gen 5 is going to double in 2020. Is that finally coming from foundry 5 nanometer? Or is there a significant chunk coming from DRAM adoption too?","Bren Higgins","So, Krish, that was -- the comments were that we thought a doubling in '19 from '18, although to Rick's earlier point about Gen 5, I mean, we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check, as that rolls in terms of how it supports EUV radical qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen 5. But we haven't quantify you know how much more I mean, we are shipping both generations to support activity goes for 7 nanometer for 5. But you'll see more adoption of Gen 5 when production is Gen 5.","Rick Wallace","And then just add to Bren's point, what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer, major customer in terms of the early evaluation and use as it sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19 where we got it up and established in all the leading jobs.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I mean, certainly, Krish, just one other thing as I look at the order profile, it would imply -- we're going to have growth in the number of unites as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double, but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year.","Operator","The next question is from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","On EUV lithography adoption in your mask inspection business from Analyst Day, I think you could gather that your radical inspection franchise is going to grow pretty strongly this year, up about 45%. But if I look at the shipment profile for ASML, let's say, over the next couple of years, it's still a runway for very strong growth around 25%, 30% shipping CAGR. With that in mind, how should we think about the trajectory of your mass inspection business looking into next year?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I mean, I think Harlan, you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE and reticle inspection, and that's been adoption for the Teron inspection, and that's been adoption for the Teron platform, both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is, yes, the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So, we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer size as we see incremental capacity there, and then you'll start to see, some activity as we move into next year.","As we talked about at Analyst Day, we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that will start shipping in 2020 also. So, you'll see a mix and match, but as we stand today, I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV. We believe we've got the market pretty well serve with the capability that we're offering.","Harlan Sur","And then on the specialty semiconductor segment, you drove pretty good quarterly results despite given the trade headwinds. And so, again, if I look at the trends heading into next year, you've got a big step up in RF content in 5G smartphones and infrastructure. You've got more power products in auto and industrial and of course all these events, packaging and things like system in package. All of this should provide a pretty good backdrop for growth next year, but I wanted to get your initial views in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 for SPTS?","Rick Wallace","Right, well, obviously we're newer to that business, but as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers. It does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you pointed out, we had some headwinds that happened in '19, but still managed to get some traction. 20 looks like a good year for SPTS and our current modeling of it based on what we see for the, as you say for RF supporting 5G. It looks like a, hopefully a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So, we feel good about it and we're continuing to learn more about those customers.","Operator","The next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Rick, so if I look at your WFE share this year, you're going to gain about 50 bps of WFE share. But I think a lot of people are looking at fabric FX, and they're sort of worried that this is a near-term peak, at least here in the back half of the year. And if you look at the capital intensity numbers, like we haven't seen these kind of quarterly numbers only really once in the past 20 years from kind of a quarterly capital intensity, point of view for non-memory. So, also people are looking at TSMC CapEx, and it's kind of 5 billion in Q4 and that's kind of $20 billion run rate. So, how do you respond to concerns that this is sort of the near-term peak in foundry and logic shipments? Is that not what you see? Do you see the quarterly shipping rates continuing to grow in foundry and logic next year? Thanks.","Rick Wallace","Well, it is true that we have strength as we mentioned the year half on half, considerable strength, but really not in a lot of customers, there are other customers that will broaden out in next year. And so we feel pretty good about how we're position. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing.","So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half of this year. But we're counting on some broadening and again, some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefits of that revenue next year. Bren, do you want to add any color to that?","Bren Higgins","No, I think Rick covered it. I mean, look, if you think most of the investment we've seen this year is from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified in demand environment into next year. We feel comfortable with given the comments we may in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability and foundry and logic is moving to 2020.","Timothy Arcuri","And then I guess I had a question on Orbotech, if you look at systems revenue, it was pretty flat. It looked like display was still pretty weak. What's assumed for December brand for Orbotech shipments? And what's the outlook for the flat panel display in the PCB business? I guess the real question is, why is the flat panel business still interesting to you? Because it seems like it's kind of on its lows and it would be arguably accretive if you sold it because it has much, much lower margin. So just, can you just kind of talk through all that?","Rick Wallace","Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean, I will say that, it looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy, but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter lead time there that those deliveries happen in December and that business is a bill to order business for us and when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well.","So I would expect it to uptick. I think, as we think about next year, I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after six years of growth, we saw 2020, our 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020, either. So, we're focused on the business. I mean, I hear your point. And we're some of the actions we're taking that I refer to in terms of cost structure, cost reduction actions are particular to that business.","And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability, these truck levels and position that we can, as the business recovers, that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first, I hear your point and we'll see how it plays out over time.","Operator","The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","I had two questions as well. For the first one, I'm curious what is the right way to think about process control intensity in EUV versus non-EUV? I imagine EUV was not as big of a factor this year, do you think it is a bigger factor?","Rick Wallace","Yes, process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers I mean, obviously the value of the EUV is reduction in layers. And so we would see that that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV but you really get process control intensity in a couple ways. One, you get it in the mash off because you have to do more inspection to ensure that you have a high quality mask and we're still as an industry trying to work out some of the challenges, pellicle, non-pellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask.","The other thing is in print check to verify and validate that the Bren mentioned in earlier question, we see rather than opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall it's a plus for some of our businesses, it is a minus for some, but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance, it's a net positive for KLA.","Vivek Arya","And my follow-up, how large was domestic China's plans for you this year? And just conceptually, how are you thinking about it going into next year?","Rick Wallace","Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said the remarks I mean, at the beginning year, we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18 and it turned out with some projects that came back into the year, one major one in particular, we're going to end up with about flat.","And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020, and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in. But it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the Company. And I would expect that to stay, it's relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020.","Vivek Arya","That is not part of outperformance assumption for next year?","Rick Wallace","No, I think, look, it is, I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean, certainly it improved the performance in with a factor and performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year. No, I don't, I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of our planning. I expect a flattish environment in China.","Operator","The next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Quinn Bolton","I just wanted to follow up on the question for our Vivek about EUV driving higher process intensity. I assumed that's true in the memory side of the business as well. So, as we look at EUV insertion in 1Z and then 1 Alpha processes. Do you see a meaningfully higher process control intensity in those steps, as we see EUV coming into high volume manufacturing? And then I've got a quick follow-up.","Rick Wallace","Yes, I mean, it's early for memory. As you know, they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers, but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense again for the same reasons you have the mask shop and you have on the wafer and you have a reduction of layers counter balancing it. I don't think there's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up, but it's not a big change in the overall intensity, maybe on the order of, if you're going to be at an average of say, 10% process control intensity, you might get half a point to a point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends, but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately, it'll also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do, have pellicles. It will change a little bit how it plays out for us.","Quinn Bolton","And then follow up question just it sounds like, you're getting a little bit more optimistic in the memory side of the business, and that might be somewhat driven by the indigenous Chinese guide. But just wondering, if you could comment based on sort of orders for the Surfscan business. Are you seeing and starting to see better activity in the NAND business? Or is it fairly isolated to sort of the customers at this point, you wouldn't call it kind of the mitigating of a broader base recovery?","Rick Wallace","No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean, certainly that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18. And so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that, which ultimately supports memory in 2020. But right now, I think it's too early to see that that impacts. So I wouldn't say it that isn't a leading indicator of new business. But certainly given the market position and that products and how memory drives wafers, it easy to pick up in memory, we will see, will do so that will see that business impacted.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Joe Quatrochi","As it relates to your service business, I was wondering if you could give us an update on some of the capacity idling that you've seen particularly on the memory side and your installed base, and maybe how do we think about that relative to the gross margin guide for the December quarter?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I know, it's a good question. I mean, one of the things that we are seeing and drove an uptick in the revenue level for service, quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in reduction in idling, so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So, look you do have a gross margin impact to growth in service on the overall model, which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally.","And I think you keep in mind is with our service business as it grows, the profitability stream, we believe is in a creative stream to the overall total. So, it's not affecting I think quarter-to-quarter, it has very little effect on the overall gross margin, in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model.","Joe Quatrochi","And then on the specialty semi side, now I think you're calling for flat this year. Can you help us understand it -- was there any incremental impact indirectly from Huawei or is this more related to weakness that you're seeing in just general demand?","Bren Higgins","Yes, I would say, the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter, so we continue to see that and we talked about, if I recall in $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular, there are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean and Osats. So there are a number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business down the long run, as those customers in that area or the any customer, the customers customer service to redesign around some of these issues, it creates opportunities for us","So, but in this year, it's affecting that business. Also automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker, so that's so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing I think a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in, and we'd expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth, as Rick suggested earlier. But, business has really good market position, I think the long term drivers around 5G, advanced packaging power and so on, are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see and we like the business models of that business.","Rick Wallace","Yes, and more specifically, I think on Huawei it's not about. The reactions of the suppliers to Huawei, it was -- there was uncertainty when the first came and trying to figure out, and I think everybody froze. So, the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain, so we think that business ultimately comes back, but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now, I think people are dealing with it and that'll actually cause the business to resume its growth.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho","Maybe first off, in the past, you talked about increasing metrology intensity on the NAND flash side, things particularly latest increase, as the industry starts shifting to 128 layers, do you see any potential new opportunities on the inspection side, given the complexity of layers then the increased number of layers for next generation devices?","Rick Wallace","I think the main opportunity. It's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really and what's happening on the bear wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher both cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean, we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects in the trenches, but it's probably more flatness driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where I've really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities we talked about at the end of this day with the work we have on CD Sacks in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection is more about Surfscan.","Patrick Ho","My follow up question in terms of the domestic China opportunity, obviously we're seeing some of this capacity built again and you're benefiting from new capacity build up. But giving some of it is also trailing edge logic type of capacity, those is simply because their new capacity, or are there opportunities within the, I guess the foundry and logic segment of that region that you see new opportunities both for years, especially in metrology products?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I think there are a number of players that are small, maybe subscale in terms of what you think about it's a larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain, if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region, reasons. So that kind of creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that.","Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities, then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share, but also good intensity. And then lastly, I think the move for auto is China's important auto market. There are more specialty semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result.","Bren Higgins","Patrick, I mean, look, I think this year is a heavier memory year in China, not by much, I'd say probably of our mix semiconductor business is 55, 45 to memory. And look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So, to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT, we're talking about automotive. And so the yields learning challenges and logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shipping are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements, also providing some upgrade path as they start to progress, some of their technology.","So, and they're serving, I think real markets, ultimately. And so I think they're designing for specific opportunities, which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment in their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there.","Operator","Your final question is from the Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","I just wanted to go back to the half over half kind of cadence for your business going into next year. You guys accurately called your core process control business being up, I guess, every quarter on a sequential basis, this year, a couple quarters ago. So I guess the question is based on, customer projects based on customer conversations. What are your thoughts into the first half of 2020 relative to the second half of '19? Do you think you can grow your business or should we be expecting more of a flattish outlook on half over half basis? Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Well, like I said, I think we're a little early guide second half or have to have trajectories and obviously I think that this part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean, across the segments again, as we said earlier, we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry.","I mean, if you just take a step back and look at the second half of 20-ish% over the first half, it does obviously imply, the WFE is higher in the first half or the second half versus first half. So the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year of these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half, you have to have that kind of growth to sort of sustain at this level of business, but I think that's probably as far as I can go with this point.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I guess what I would add to that is, we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're now in a great position to predict WFE.","Toshiya Hari","Yes, it does. As a quick follow-up, on China, on native China WFE, I think Bren, you talked about 2020. At least at this point kind of looking kind of flattest relative to 2019, when you think about the mix of spend on process control, does that move higher or what are your preliminary thoughts on that?","Bren Higgins","Yes, I know, as I said earlier, I think it's balanced across the business and we expect them expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So not expecting, at least for our business, not expecting growth and not expecting decline in 2020 at this point, we'll see how it plays out, but that's where we where we stand today.","Operator","Thank you and that concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Kessel for closing remarks.","Kevin Kessel","Yes. Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for your time today and interest in KLA.

My name is Lance and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood of KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Lance. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven\u2019t seen the release, you can find it on our website.","Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on our non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in the Investor Relation presentation on KLA-Tencor\u2019s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Wallace","Thanks, Ed. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter for KLA-Tencor with shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finishing at the upper end of guidance. KLA-Tencor delivered the second highest quarterly booking results in our history in the June quarter offsetting all-time records in quarterly shipments, revenue GAAP, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. I am also pleased to report that we ended the June quarter with a positive book-to-bill with record total backlog of almost $2 million. Also we are pleased to note our continued progress our timeline for closing the Orbotech acquisition in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. On July 12, the Orbotech shareholders approved the merger and to-date we have received all the necessary regulatory approvals with the exception of Korea and China, which we expect to obtain in due course.","The record results and strong momentum KLA-Tencor is delivering today demonstrates the value of our market leadership and the critical nature of process control. They also highlight our market diversification and the benefits of our exposure to growth markets, such as EUV lithography, the early ramp of 7-nanometer devices in foundry, growth in bare wafer market to address capacity growth in memory in China to highlight a few. The overall, WFE industry environment continues to perform at a high level and we are excited about the prospects for continued strength in industry demand as we begin the second half of 2018 and look ahead to 2019. Our view is for WFE levels to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2018 aligned with the current consensus growth forecast for the year. Against this industry backdrop, our view for KLA-Tencor revenue growth is in the low double-digits for the calendar year.","Now, let\u2019s discuss some of the unique dynamics that are fueling our market leadership and diversified growth. First, we are experiencing near record levels of demand in mask inspection and registration fueled by customers\u2019 investments in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography supporting 10 and 7-nanometer design tape-out. KLA-Tencor is working with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development and yield learning providing a complete portfolio of advanced mask inspection solutions. EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth for process control as it continues to enable linear scaling and presents market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address as the market leader in mask and wafer inspection as well as in films, CD and overlay metrology.","Another example is in how over the past several quarters we have seen exceptional growth in demand for bare wafer inspection and metrology solutions driven by the expansion of bare wafer supply associated with a strong memory market as well as more stringent cleanliness and flatness requirements for bare wafers. In addition, IC, memory and logic customers are also experience \u2013 increased their investment in process tool qualification to limit yield excursions and to meet aggressive yield and capacity ramp goals.","A third example of how KLA-Tencor is benefiting from our market diversification and technology leadership is seen in our strong results in China. Investment in China is the next major market inflection of WFE and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable development and growth of the China semiconductor industry. Our customers in China are investing with us in a high level to accelerate early process development and yield learning with our product portfolio as advanced process control solutions and our demonstrated ability to meet aggressive ramp schedules, KLA-Tencor business in China is operating at a high level and we expect it to remain strong for the foreseeable future.","And finally, KLA-Tencor\u2019s service business continues to be a highlight. Service is approaching $1 billion in annual revenue today and is expected to continue deliver consistent high single-digit annual revenue growth over the next several years. I will note that greater than 75% of service revenue is from service contracts to enable needed up-time of our systems demonstrating the value of the insight and technology these systems provide to enable customer success. Long-term growth in services is tied to growth in the installed base as well as from expanding investment and trailing edge fabs, which are running at full utilization in creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades.","To sum up today\u2019s results before I turn the call over to Bren June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor demonstrating the company\u2019s strong execution and fast growing industry environment. Given our market diversification and the record levels of demand we are experiencing in the marketplace, 2018 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for KLA-Tencor and we are encouraged by the early signs of continuing momentum we are seeing for 2019.","I will now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick and good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue, shipments and earnings per share once again achieving record levels. These results were driven by strong demand across our major product markets as well as the solid execution of our strategic objectives.","Revenue was $1.070 billion in the June quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were both $2.22. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now, turning to highlights of the June demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.07 billion, about $20 million above the midpoint of guidance and finishing into top end of the guidance range for the quarter driven by strength in memory. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be down almost 10% at the midpoint and be in the range of $935 million or $1.015 billion. Our current expectation is for shipment growth in the second half of calendar \u201818 to be flat to up low single-digits compared with the first half with sequential quarterly growth resuming in the December quarter. While second half shipments will be stronger than the first half, this half to half growth expectation is modestly lower than our expectations from 3 months ago given the widely reported memory push-outs in slowing logic investment.","Our shipment mix in the second half of the year has continued strong customer pull from our memory customers, including those in China, ramping bare wafer products and expected pickup in foundry logic shipments in the second half of the year. Memory was 69% of shipments and in line with our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 28% of total system shipments in the period. For September, we expect memory shipments to be approximately 59% of the total. Foundry was 22% of shipments in the June quarter and foundry is forecasted to be about 36% of shipments in Q3 driven by increases in EUV investment and 7-nanometer design starts. Logic was 9% of shipments and our current outlook is for logic to be approximately 5% of total system shipments this quarter.","In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments, patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for our metrology businesses and for reticle inspection; service was 21%; and non-semi was approximately 3%. Revenue was a record $1.070 billion in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect September revenue to be flat into midpoint and be in the range of $1.030 to $1.110 billion for the quarter. Revenue in the second half of calendar \u201818 is expected to grow in the mid single-digits compared with first half, aligned with our current outlook for revenue growth in the low double-digits in the calendar year.","Gross margins were 64.8% at the upper end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance in June were consistent with recent margin trends for the efforts largely driven by product mix. Looking forward to September, we expect gross margins to again be in the range of 64% to 65% as improving service margins offset slightly weaker product system mix.","Total operating expenses were $265 million in June and operating margin was 40%. We continue to see many opportunities for top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and advanced memory applications to name three important examples. For the September quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $270 million with variability around its operating expense level driven principally by the timing of non-headcount engineering program development costs.","For the full year in calendar \u201818, we expect operating margins to be in the 39% range, solidly above the targeted 38% plus margin level in our published business model for these revenue levels and demonstrating KLA-Tencor\u2019s leading market position and business execution. Free cash flow margin is currently forecasted to be in the upper 20th percentile in 2018, ranking KLA-Tencor among the top tier companies in our industry. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter in line with our guidance and our long-term tax planning rate. Finally, net income for the June quarter was a record $348 million and we had 156.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","Turning briefly to highlights of the June quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at almost $2.9 billion. Cash from operations was strong at $374 million and free cash flow was $351 million. In the quarter, we retired $225 million of outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility, paid in aggregate of $117 in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $38 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. At the end of the June quarter, we had just under $1 million authorized under our share repurchase program. Legal restrictions related to the timing of shareholder approval of the Orbotech transaction limited our repurchase activity in Q2, but we plan to resume repurchases in the September quarter targeting quarterly repurchase volumes consistent with our previously articulated approach, an expected 12 to 18 month timeframe subject to market conditions. We have an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorized upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition.","Finally, I will note that we will adopt a new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are adopting ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. Also throughout FY \u201819 which ends on June 30, 2019, we will provide a quarterly reconciliation of reported revenue as well as what revenue would have been under the old reporting standards in order to help investors quantify the impact of differences in revenue recognition under the old and new standards. We do not foresee any impact to cash flows or business operations from the adoption of ASC 606. However, adoption of ASC 606 will impact reported revenue.","Here is the summary of two primary changes to revenue recognition resulting from the adoption of ASC 606. First, instead of accruing the cost of 1-year warranties for systems that we sell to our customers, we will allocate revenue to the warranty element of each transaction and recognized the revenue over the warranty period since we will provide preventative maintenance as well as repair services during the warranty period in a manner consistent with our normal service contracts. Second, we will continue to recognize systems revenue at the point of time where we have satisfied our performance obligations and transfer control of the product to a customer. The determination of satisfaction and performance obligations is based on several factors, including the transfer of title, physical possession of the tool by the customer, customer acceptance of the product and whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of consumer products. We expect that the new standard will generally allow for earlier timing of revenue recognition and circumstances were to deem that sufficient performance indicators have been satisfied to conclude that control has been transferred to the customer.","We are still assessing the overall impact to revenue from adoption of the new standard. As I mentioned in the detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition between the old and new standards will be provided on a quarterly basis, beginning with the reporting of the results for the September quarter. Going forward, quarterly guidance including the guidance for the September quarter will only be provided based on the new rules. We will report actual revenue under both sets of rules for every quarter in fiscal \u201819 and our Form 10-Q. Although there are future factors in terms of shipment, timing and customer acceptance of products, including packed results under both standards, based on current shipment and revenue forecast, we expect the difference in reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable in calendar \u201818 and in the range of 1% plus or minus 50 basis points higher when compared with the old standard.","In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor\u2019s June quarter reflects the company\u2019s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer\u2019s growth strategies and the value of our industry leading business model. The semiconductor and semi-equipment industry environment today is strong, healthy and performing at a high level with multiple growth fueled by demand from exciting new applications such as artificial intelligence, big data, increasing semiconductor automotive content and the Internet of Things layered on top of investment in China in the traditional computing and mobility markets. As the market leader in process control and with our revenue diversification within the labor fab equipment market, coupled with the new opportunities for growth in market expansion presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and it continues to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","Looking forward to the second half of 2018 and beyond fueled by record total backlog at the end of the June quarter and growth in revenue in the second half of the year, we are positioned for another year of solid growth in 2018 and look forward to more of the same in 2019. With that, our guidance for the September quarter is shipments in the range of $935 million to $1.015 billion, revenue between $1.030 billion and $1.110 billion and GAAP diluted EPS $2 to 2.32 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 to $2.36 per share.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we would like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Please feel free to re-queue for any additional questions you may have and we will do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today\u2019s call as time permits.","Alright, Lance, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks very much. Bren, I guess the first question is it looks like you lost maybe $50 million in shipments for the entirety of the second half, almost all of which was in the third calendar quarter. So I guess my question is with this all memory and the inevitable question is going to be why should everyone trust that September quarter is going to be the bottom of what is \u2013 what you see to basically catalyze Q4 being better? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Bren Higgins","Yes, Tim. So, it\u2019s pretty well chronicled about some of the push-outs that we have seen over the last month or so, and that\u2019s an industry statement. Yes, it was mostly memory. There was some impact in some other segments as well, but most of it is memory. Based on what we see in our build plans, we see a pretty strong snapback into the December quarter and all indications here at this point given our conversations with customers with all customers is that that\u2019s the case. So, we are pretty confident about it. I think it\u2019s our customers behaving rationally in terms of how they are managing capacity and we would expect it to come back in Q4.","Timothy Arcuri","Awesome, thanks. And then just as my follow-up question, you guys almost always are at or above the high-end of the earnings range. So, if I assume that, that\u2019s going to happen again in the third quarter that would put you at basically $950 million to $960 million in annualized earnings, so the stock will be trading at roughly 10.5x to 11x earnings. So I would think that you are chomping at the bit to basically buyback your stock at these levels. So, can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for repo and what the cadence might be once you are able to do that? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","So, we authorized $1 billion, which I covered this in the prepared remarks, we authorized $1 billion and then another $1 billion contingent on the closing of the Orbotech acquisition and a timeframe for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. So, we were able to do that for legal reasons in the June quarter and we would expect that we plan to begin doing that in a much more aggressive way beginning this quarter. So, we tend to be very principled focus in terms of how we think about the execution of this in the principle that ultimately drives how we think about deploying the cash flows of the company. So we plan to do that in a systematic way, although we do have flexibility to be opportunistic as we move over the next 12 months, but we expect to step up our posture and we will increase it even further after we close the Orbotech acquisition.","Timothy Arcuri","Awesome, Bren. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution guys. On the significantly better sustainability of your business relative to others in the equipment market, you guys have always talked about your business as being more tied to the rate of new technology migration versus capacity addition, I think your EUV mask inspection platform is a good example of that, Gen-5 is a good example of that. And it seems that technology migration cadence continues to be strong across all segments of the market, is that at a high level how we should think about the sustainability of your business here in the second half relative to what your peers are seeing out there that are probably more a little bit more capacity focused?","Rick Wallace","Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Rick. I think that\u2019s right, there is a couple factors. One, we do have a more diversified set of customers as opposed to being pure-play and so we have got a number of elements if you think about mask manufacturing, but also wafer manufacturing has been an important segment for us and that has capacity and technology built into it as customers push the sensitivity requirements and flatness requirements of our wafer manufacturers that drives the business cycle there, reticles for new tape-outs for EUV, you talked about Gen-5, there is also \u2013 it\u2019s also true in metrology products. So, it\u2019s a broad base of customers all advancing technologies both memory and logic and we also have of course the activities that are going on in China, so pretty broad and we feel good about the diversification of the customer base at this point.","Harlan Sur","Thanks for the insights there. And the other thing that you guys have talked about and I am wondering again how much does this add to a pretty strong second half demand profile is that you guys have talked about strong new product pipeline right, which in some cases is expanding your SAM opportunity like the Voyager platform. Did you guys just recently introduced for pulsatile developed inspection. You also introduced your Surfscan SP7 tool. Here you guys got 90% market share like how is the new product cadence and in some cases the SAM expansion helping the momentum here in the second half and into next year?","Rick Wallace","Well, we have always been a product company, Harlan. So we do need this innovation and does two things. One, it enables our customers to move their technology forward. It also makes it very challenging from a competitive standpoint for people to keep up with us given the rate of introduction and investment in new capability. And as you point out, we are bringing out new platforms that will have the new addressable markets in addition to the ones that you mentioned with Voyager and SP7, their other products in the pipeline. So, it gives us a lot of confidence as we finish off calendar \u201818 and go into \u201819 and beyond that we are well-positioned not just to continue to perform across all sectors, but also drive additional growth through the additional expansion of our available markets.","Bren Higgins","Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Bren. The other thing I would add is that it helps to offset some of the impact that bringing us, when you bring new capability to market, customers want to try to use that capability and so there is \u2013 that becomes pretty attractive to them. It also brings favorable economics with each generation. So even if they don\u2019t need the capability, there is a cost of ownership improvement that comes with new generations of products. So, even if they don\u2019t need the capability, they tend to \u2013 there is an economic motive as well. So to Rick\u2019s point, it\u2019s important for our competitive positioning to maintain the cadence that\u2019s far ahead of what our competitors are doing, but it also provides an opportunity for customers to leverage the capability and for us to offset the impact of some of those kinds of things.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question with the adoption of ASC 606, can you still manage your business to a 6-month backlog that\u2019s always been a core part of offering great visibility etcetera. So, curious what the ramifications are of this change in accounting standard?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I know it\u2019s a good question, C.J. I think around the 6-month backlog in terms of orders to shipment, you will see us continue to manage within that window. I\u2019d ideally like to have that down closer to 5 versus 6. Where we will see the impact of 606 is that you will see revenue come to the P&L sooner, the standards around qualifying for revenue from a shipment perspective, you will have more shipments effectively becoming revenue sooner. So, where we will have with the consolidated customer base you have more \u2013 potentially more volatility in the revenue number. We increased the range a little bit as a result of potentially that factor, because it does reduce the daylight between shipments and revenue. But for our business, it should stay relatively consistent I talked to some of the principle changes in the prepared remarks, but in terms of how we manage lead times from order to shipment that part of our business won\u2019t change.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up typically I guess in terms of new capacity as you guys outperformed and so as we look at your second half outperformance for the guide, is that indicative of capacity adds that we should start to see layering it and starting Q4, Q1, Q2, is that a majority of it or is it more leverage to mask and wafer inspection where the full industry won\u2019t benefit from that, anyway to sort of help us understand the moving parts there?","Bren Higgins","Yes. So, there are a lot of moving parts, meaning you are right, I mean, reticle and wafer will have those businesses are ramping and so that will have an impact into the first part of the year. The shipments into China, I don\u2019t expect that to abate. That\u2019s been fairly consistent obviously big projects which seems like over the course of this year we have had our project to quarter pretty much. So we will see how that plays out as you move into the next phases there. We are seeing foundry logics start to come back in the second half profile and that \u2013 and if you look at the order mix that I think is a pretty good harbinger for what we expect to see into the first part of next year in terms of the bigger contribution from those segments. So I think that I wish I can give you more, but it is a bit of an all of the above answer, but clearly, there are aspects to Rick\u2019s point earlier of the ramp around wafer and mask that is a bit unique to K-T.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question and Bren, thanks for the color on the September shipments. I just had a question it looks like your memory numbers in calendar Q3 are in line with your peers you are seeing a nice snapback in foundry. Can you just tell us, give us some color on what\u2019s driving those foundry shipments, is it one customer or is it across multiple customers and along the same path in December, the snapback you are seeing in memory is it driven by DRAM or NAND? And I just had a follow-up after that.","Rick Wallace","So on the foundry side, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean we are seeing foundry logic both come back and so you got multiple customers investing there, but certainly on the foundry side of one customer is investing more than others. On the \u2013 I am just taking a quick look here, so in September we would expect it to be slightly weighted to DRAM of the memory mix.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And then as a follow-up question, I just wanted to find out is there a way \u2013 can you guys say how much of your total sales is exposed to EUV at this point, is there a way to quantify that and also the bare wafer inspection business has been pretty strong for a couple of quarters, how sustainable do you think this is? Thank you.","Rick Wallace","We don\u2019t really quantified around the EUV participation, but I would say it\u2019s on the order of 5% to 10% depending on how you look at it. And certainly there is development work that\u2019s going on, that will scale. We do think the process control intensity around EUV is similar to what process control intensity is for non-EUV which means as EUV costs go up for scanners the process control will scale with that, so that it is definitely consistent trend.","Bren Higgins","And Chris what was the second part of your question?","Krish Sankar","The sustainability of the bare wafer inspection business?","Bren Higgins","To the Rick\u2019s comments in the prepared remarks, I mean we are seeing significant investment there both being driven by the strong memory environment. You have got increasing flatness specs. You have got cleanliness specs that are driving investments from the IC manufacturers. To support all that you have the wafer manufacturers also investing. So they have to deliver wafers. They have under invested for a number of years and so you are seeing new investment there against new specs. So I would expect those numbers to continue to be strong as we move certainly through this year and through next year as well. And as long as there is significant investment in memory from a WFE perspective, we are going to see that business participate pretty strongly.","Krish Sankar","Thanks Rick. Thanks Bren.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","Yes, great. Thank you so much. Fundamentals in the flat panel display industry have certainly deteriorated since you announced the Orbotech deal, so Rick I wanted to ask if your view on that part of the industry has changed long-term?","Rick Wallace","Well, we always said it\u2019s through cycle mentality looking at the businesses that Orbotech was in, that hasn\u2019t changed. And we are not really in a position to talk about their business yet, but in terms of the strategic nature of that deal we feel very good about the original thesis and all the subsequent work we have done so far with that team. We are very excited about putting the two together and obviously we will have a lot more to say once we finished the regulatory process.","Toshiya Hari","Understood. And then secondly Bren you talked a little bit about service margins improving in the September quarter and that to some extent offsetting the decline in margins on the products side, can you elaborate on that point and talk to sustainability and service margins? Thank you.","Bren Higgins","Sure. I mean there were minor changes there. I mean one of the good things we are seeing in China in-service now that we have invested pretty significantly in China to add resources to support all of that business both to be able to ramp those fabs and then support them over time. And as you know they are geographically pretty dispersed. So between the field resources, but also infrastructure to support all that activity we have been investing pretty significantly over the last 12 months to 18 months. We are now slowly completing that and so we are starting to see the incremental margins flow through on service. So I would expect one good thing about the consolidated customer base is we are able to get to leverage service infrastructures certainly in certain places like in China or not well maybe the investments in China, but in Korea or in Taiwan we are able to try to leverage those resources. So it\u2019s a good story and I would expect to see service continued to be well. Obviously, it\u2019s dilutive to our overall gross margins but the incremental offsets some of that ongoing dilution. But we believe the operating margin profile of business is certainly strong and accretive to the overall company.","Toshiya Hari","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your shipment by geography, Korea was really strong this past fiscal year, I am just trying to better understand, would you be able to quantitatively help me understand the mix maybe perhaps between memory and bare wafer?","Rick Wallace","Almost of it is memory in Korea. I mean there is a little bare wafer, but most of it is memory.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay, helpful. And then looking forward there are a couple of new fabs coming online Greenfield fabs and I am trying to assess how I should think about your new product and a scaling should we expect your revenue to or a percentage of your system revenue as a percentage of WFE finally to hit 10% plus as your design wins are scale especially for 3D NAND and two of these new fabs for 90 plus layer 3D NAND manufacturing and would that give you the opportunity to see a material increase in memory especially NAND?","Rick Wallace","So we have been pretty pleased with the process control intensity improvement that we have seen in flash and so it\u2019s been a good sign. I would expect that the new products if we can continue so our customer problems will continue to see some momentum there. It\u2019s still about half of that what we see in foundry logic. So the intensity for lots of reasons is lower, but we are seeing incremental improvement. We have seen more metrology. We have new metrology products specifically targeted let\u2019s say should help with that. So as we move forward with the increase in foundry logic mix, we would expect into next year really having an all time low this year. We would also expect that to influence the overall process control in terms of the percent of wafer, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in 3D NAND and if we can continue to execute hopefully there is more there for us.","Bren Higgins","So Mehdi just to build on that, the challenge has not been available problems to solve, the challenge has been solutions which solve those problems and it\u2019s not a competitive challenge for us, it\u2019s just the feasibility, so it\u2019s taken some time to work and collaborate with those customers to get new technologies to market really to address the verticalization of NAND. And we have very strong products in the pipeline addressing that. So we think calendar \u201819 we will see continued success with those initial penetrations and that will be the basis for driving additional percent of WFE out of memory.","Mehdi Hosseini","Okay. So one way or another it should move higher, right now it\u2019s like 7% to 8% of WFE, it should move higher as\u2026?","Bren Higgins","Correct.","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the guiding in tough environment. Two questions on China, Rick my understanding is that the three key domestic Chinese product lines are almost done this year and the emphasis is to improve the yield, given your position in inspection market, can you just update us where the yield stand with those domestic projects and then what your expectations are for the volume business to come from those projects. And then as a follow-up, if you can also talk about tariffs and implications from tariffs on your supply chain or your business?","Rick Wallace","Sure. The exciting thing is we have great partnerships with our customers in China looking at ramping retail facilities. And as you might imagine there is a lot of interest in our expertise and capability there, so we are partnered very closely and we have had a lot of executive exchanges as well as others. So we feel very good about our ability to support their new fabs in their ramp. I won\u2019t get into the specific of the yields, but they are making progress. We are seeing the promise of additional investment based on the initial success that they are seeing and we feel very good about our position and enabling that as they go forward. And of course in this case it\u2019s really across the product portfolio. In terms of the implications of tariffs, our supply chain isn\u2019t based in China, so from a standpoint of our key components we are not really subject to that, obviously we have an eye out for other changes that could be coming. But as of this point, it does not have any impact on our business.","Bren Higgins","And then Atif just in terms of the investment profile. I mean as we \u2013 just thinking about from an order perspective and there is a little bit more lead time to these orders because in a lot of cases, they are building new facilities. But we have seen remarkable stability. If you just go back in the last couple of years and even as we look forward of the business levels we are seeing in China. So this year we should book somewhere in the neighborhood and I said this before somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million or so from indigenous China and I would expect that level of investment to continue and we will see as start gating out, little ways of away from what things will look like as we move into \u201819 but all indications at this point give me confidence that we are going to continue to see this level of investment for these players as we move forward.","Atif Malik","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Good afternoon, Rick. Thanks for letting me asking questions. Congratulations on solid results. I think you guys talked about in your prepared comments the September shipments from logic being down around 5%, which I think is the second lowest and kind of our dataset at least. I am kind of curious as you think about the December recovery, is logic kind of helping bolster that view of a recovery in December, is it still just mostly memory?","Bren Higgins","Hi, John. Bren here too. Yes, John, you are right I mean September is fairly weak, so we do see some bounce back in that segment. We also see bounce back in foundry. So, we do see the shifting profile of 40%ish or so of the shipment mix going to foundry logic into the second half of the year. So, yes, it looks like it\u2019s going to bounce back, it looks like there is some sustainability to it into the first part of next year.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And then Rick it\u2019s nice to see that despite the fact that WFE is mixing slightly more towards memory this year than last year, but you guys are still significantly outgrowing WFE. I am curious to what extent do you think that\u2019s just better leveraged to memory versus kind of EUV playing out this year and you talked about kind of the process intensity of NAND, how should we think about 1Y and 1Z on the DRAM front?","Rick Wallace","So, I think the part that\u2019s maybe a little misunderstood and we need to do a better job explaining it is things like the wafer manufacturer is there is high capital intensity of inspection and metrology for those and they are really feeding the memory guys. So, it\u2019s probably the case that our intensity around memory is higher than the way it\u2019s traditionally thought of. So, we are seeing a lot of benefit in the demands that are placed on wafers as they moved to new technologies in memory, because of the cleanliness and also the flatness. So that\u2019s actually been a boost. And as you point out on the EUV factor is still there and then lastly we would say the process control intensity in China has been supportive of the overall business environment for us as we have great positions there and in their early stages of trying to ramp new facilities. So I think all of those factors have come together to give us a very nice 2018 and what looks like a very strong 2019.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is now open.","Edwin Mok","Hi, great job guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the foundry side, you mentioned that there is improvement on foundry shipments from September to December, if I calculate correctly second half is actually really strong versus first half, is it all driven by 7-nanometer or are you seeing that demand year-over-year and then just kind of tied to [indiscernible], should we expect a much higher level of Gen-5 adoption in 5-nanometer versus 7, can you kind of talk about the Gen-5 progress?","Rick Wallace","I think there is couple of ways to think about it. It\u2019s early for 5, but EUV activity drives a lot of the business in the mouse shop. And so we are seeing the benefit from that in terms of our business in mask is doing quite well. Also wafer manufacturers are very supportive of bringing in new capabilities. So we are seeing that as a driver. And then you do see Gen-5 and you see actually some of the metrology tools too in support of the new nodes, so I think it\u2019s really a combination of those factors that gives us the diversification of reach across to the customers and is really driving the general outperform.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I think the other thing that\u2019s happening is as you are seeing an increase in 7-nanometer tape-outs moving through the foundries and so a) that\u2019s driving certain reticle capability, not just writers, but then inspectors from us, but we would expect to follow-on capacity additions to support that business. As we move into \u201819 you start to see some of that investment around 5-nanometer development. Certainly, Gen-5 plays a bigger role in that. I would expect that business to grow next year versus this year just driven by some of these dynamics.","Edwin Mok","Great. That was extremely helpful. And then just a question on the OpEx and maybe I guess operating leverage on the model, Bren, do you think you can sustain OpEx at this level, it seems like December you can grow quite a bit and it sounds like you guys upbeat at least in the first half of \u201819, do you think you can maintain OpEx at this level or just grow OpEx, can you talk about that?","Bren Higgins","Yes. I would think the OpEx is going to trend in line with the model that we published. So we are operating about 50 to 100 basis points above that model for these revenue levels given the commentary we provided around next year, it sort of fits within that. So I would see the OpEx scaling a little bit in line with the models we have published. We try to drive incremental margins, certainly greater than 40% target, 40% to 50% on our incremental margins. So there is a number of new programs we are investing in, new platforms supporting EUV, supporting extra metrology. So, in addition to a couple of things that we just recently announced and there is follow-on activity around those. So I would expect us to continue to invest. We are going to deliver to the model we have been public with and we are going to continue to try to drive leverage through. But given the level of business we are seeing, I feel pretty good about the sustainability of our investment profile.","Edwin Mok","Great. Thank you.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. And Rick, I appreciate the color you have given on some of the increasing capital intensity trends on the memory side. Maybe as a follow-up to John\u2019s question earlier about DRAM and the 1X and 1Y, you talked about the cleanliness and some of the issues there. As the DRAM ministry moves to 1Y and you see a lot more of these multi-patterning steps and even some of the process change where they could come, I guess more logic like, is that also helping to increase the process control intensity given that they are more logic like and obviously those \u2013 that that\u2019s been your key bread-and-butter for the years?","Rick Wallace","Well, certainly, we are seeing interest and some adoption of Gen-5 in the DRAM guys as they look at 1Y. So absolutely we are seeing that. And that wasn\u2019t necessarily originally anticipated the degree with which we have seen that strength, but it just \u2013 it kind of goes to the point of the desire to get more capability in there and the fact that the coverage matters quite a bit. So we have just placed some interest that people have had at e-beam for those applications with Gen-5. So we feel very good about that. And we are definitely getting indications that there is more to come there. It\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s also registration, so if you think about DRAM and the challenges it has for registration we see more adoption there as well. So we feel very good about the trends that we are seeing in memory as well.","Bren Higgins","So Patrick we are encouraged \u2013 we are trying to be a little more conservative in terms of how we model it just given the historic behavior from these customers what we deliver, believe we can deliver any capability here around some of these problems as that\u2019s an opportunity for us. Most of the context that provide around performance and intensity levels is based on little improvement there, so if we can drive improvement in process control intensity that\u2019s an opportunity for us to deliver incremental upside sort of the base model about how we are running the business over the next few years.","Patrick Ho","Right. And Bren, maybe as my follow-up question in terms of services, you talked about 75% of your revenues are coming from I guess the service contract today, but unlike process tools which in many cases can eke themselves up and it just becomes a kind of recurring revenue stream of replacing parts. Can you give a little color of the type of value-added solution or some of the product enhancement that process control can offer and how that can grow?","Bren Higgins","Well, I mean certainly the contract profile that you got it pretty well, where there is a limited number of these tools, they are very important to keep them up and customers want to contract structure to ensure that the uptime and availability is there. And so the 75% certain level of contract as a percent of the total has been fairly consistent at that level. So, we feel very good about the sustainability of that over time as they stretch the installed base. We are continuing to look for opportunities to sell incremental enhancements to the installed base. As you know that there is a lot of trailing edge activity that\u2019s happening to support automotive and IoT, they are running those older fabs and the installed base much harder. So, there is incremental demand for those customers to not only drive higher uptime for their tools, which is driving the business, but also to buy enhancements to the current installed base and those fabs are full, so it\u2019s not like in some cases you can move in extra tools, you are going to add incremental capability to the existing school, whether it\u2019s speed or increased sensitivity. So, we are pursuing and looking at those opportunities and given that the stratification of demand for semi, it creates an interesting opportunity for us going forward.","Rick Wallace","And maybe a very significant difference between process control, service business and process business, is the availability of alternative suppliers for consumables. So if you are in a process company, you have that threat of outside sources providing consumables, process control, we have a very strong position to enable and make this equipment continue to perform as is designed and that\u2019s really a big part of the value proposition. So they are different businesses.","Patrick Ho","Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sidney Ho","Thanks for taking my questions. Your largest foundry customer in Taiwan talked about improving manufacturing efficiencies. From your experience with them, do their CapEx cut impacting all the equivalent types equally or do you think that will impact you guys less because process control is more front-end loaded. And clearly your guidance for September quarter is very good do you think it is more than offset by their spending on 7 nanometers in EUV?","Rick Wallace","Well, I think there is two sides of it. One, we like to believe we enable better capital efficiency by helping customers get more value out of the rest of their tools. On the other hand, of course, every customer is trying to manage all their costs and work across the products to extend and reuse. And as Bren said, one of the keys to our success is to continually bring out new products and new capabilities as a counter. What you have clearly got to show is continued improvement and cost of ownership performance, which means more capability. So, I think the answer is kind of both. I think you definitely see a push from all of our customers to enhance their sustainability of their investment and by doing that drive efficiency and we enabled that and we also try to support it by driving new capabilities.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. My follow-up question is related to China, can you talk about your shipment strength in China this quarter, this June quarter. About a year ago, you talked about China as the region has the potential of SAM for process control for about $5 billion between 2017 and 2020, given your comment that Chinese manufacturers seems to have high process control intensity, do you think that estimate is higher, lower is just about the same?","Rick Wallace","I think it\u2019s too early to say. I mean we have seen in the same time we have seen some softening in the forecast for the sort of wafer outs in China. So I don\u2019t know that we could speculate on that. We are pleased with the production that the support in the business that we have got in China, but I would say if they meet their published goals, then we will exceed that target. However, I think there are some definite challenges that they have got in terms of scaling those factories over time in the next couple of years.","Sidney Ho","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. One more on China, so shipments there were 32% of total versus 18% kind of level, were there anyone off and I think somewhere during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect China to stay around the $600 million contribution level next year, so kind of flat. I just wanted to confirm I heard that right?","Rick Wallace","You did. I mean, that\u2019s an order level. And so what actually \u2013 how much actually shifts and revenues may deviate a bit, although we have been \u2013 things have been pretty consistent in and around that level. So that\u2019s a reasonable number to use as you think moving forward. And if you look last quarter there was significant vertical NAND project that we ship to this quarter, there is a significant DRAM project, it\u2019s not all the business, but certainly a big part of it.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And then on the services side, is there a backlog number we should keep in mind or I guess often a different way, if we assume that WFE is conceptually flat next year, can you still grow your services business at a double-digit base?","Rick Wallace","I mean, the way the service business generally works is you have booking shipments in the same quarter. There is some extended warranty backlog, but it\u2019s pretty minor. So there isn\u2019t a backlog number, but it\u2019s continuous in terms of the contracts that we signed and then we get the POs that are consistent with those contracts. But the other thing that contributes to it, if you think about the installed base and how long it lasts, one of the things driving, if you will, IoT or automotive is found to be utilizing longer, customers wanting more capability, wanting both enhancements and also those tools to run longer. So, the decay rate of what we would have originally modeled of tools coming off contract is slower and that\u2019s how you can drive growth even in a flat systems shipment business, which we don\u2019t think ours will be flat by the way even if WFE is flat, we are going to grow this year. So, we think there is still lot of energy left in the sustainability of the growth in services.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Yes, thanks for the follow-up. Given how far behind China is in terms of mainstream technology adoption, given that they do have a track record of higher process control intensity, have you guys seen any Gen-5 pull-ins from China, which may help them to accelerate the yield learning? And then just a quick follow-up in terms of keeping the product pipeline healthy, can you just give us an update on the multi-column e-beam EUV reticle inspection platform, is that still on track for introduction next year?","Rick Wallace","Boy, those are our two very different questions, Harlan. So, in terms of the indigenous China projects, we have not seen demand yet for Gen-5 for those projects that we think that\u2019s down the road for the guys that are doing memory, that\u2019s something that certainly we could envision down the road once as you say. Right now, that\u2019s not really their focus nor at this point is that their need we can satisfy with the number of the products that we already have. In terms of the multi-beam product, we continue to make investment, we continue to work through some of the technical hurdles and we have a lot of closed engagements with our customers on that and there is clearly a lot of customer interest, but I won\u2019t go beyond that at this point.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. Presenters, I turn the call over back to you.","Rick Wallace","Thank you, Lance and thank you all for joining us today and your ongoing interest in the ownership of KLA-Tencor.

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Joining me today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. ","We're here today to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2012. We released these results this afternoon 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. ","A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor section of our website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. ","In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. ","Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2011 Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, you can be assured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. I'm pleased report that KLA-Tencor began calendar 2012 with a strong fiscal third-quarter, delivering revenue and earnings growth that surpassed the upper end of the guidance ranges. ","Revenue grew 31% sequentially to $841 million in the March quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.27. Gross bookings in March were $833 million, coming in at the lower end of the guidance range, with the shortfall largely attributable to a shift in the timing of one large order into the June quarter. ","In general, the semi cap equipment demand environment is healthy today. Device manufacturers are maintaining a high level of investment at the leading edge in their efforts to support technology development and to meet robust and demand forecast associated with the rapidly growing mobile electronics markets. ","As a result of these technology and demand trends, the rate of change in device and process technology remains strong and continues to accelerate. In fact, the introduction of new transistor and memory technologies, such as high-k in metal gate and thin FET in logic and 3D NAND in memory, as well as advanced manufacturing and packaging techniques, are all contributing to driving higher technology development and manufacturing cost for our customers. ","These technologies and techniques are also compounding the yield challenges at the leading edge, helping to drive strong adoption of process control. This is translating to market-leading growth for KLA-Tencor, as advanced process control becomes increasingly important for our customers. And the industry continues to look to KLA-Tencor as the market leader to meet their increasing complex inspection and measurement challenges at the leading edge. ","Our strong market position was recently highlighted in Gartner's annual industry market research report. That study shows KLA-Tencor is growing share in process control, with particular strength in the wafer inspection and metrology markets, both of which are on the critical path for enabling next-generation device innovation. ","Today's strong financial results and our industry-leading position are a direct outcome of KLA-Tencor's ongoing customer collaboration focus and the successful execution of our long-term strategic objectives. ","I'll now provide an update on the current demand environment in each of our major end markets. Orders from foundry customers were 55% of gross bookings in the March quarter. Leading edge foundry capacity remains in tight supply, as rapid growth in the mobility markets is driving demand for increasingly complex fabless application processors into the foundries. ","In this environment, foundry market leaders are ramping production in an effort to meet high levels of demand and to secure their positions in an increasingly competitive market. ","Looking ahead, foundry demand is expected to remain high, and comments earlier today from one of the leading foundries suggest that they intent to increase their 2012 CapEx budget, which should support this trend as we move ahead in the year. ","Strong foundry industry CapEx favors KLA-Tencor, as these customers tend to be the highest adopters of process control due to the heightened yield requirements unique to their high-index short time-to-market business model. ","Logic was 16% of new orders in March. Logic investment today is focused on ramping 22-nanometer processors to high-volume and development of next-generation technology at the sub 20-nanometer node. Driven by competitive dynamics surrounding the future intersection of x86 and ARM-based processors for mobility applications, we expect Logic investment to remain at a high level in calendar 2012. ","Memory bookings grew 29% of orders in March, with orders from NAND customers representing 60% of the memory orders. Mobility are driving NAND growth rate, and capacity growth in NAND remains modest, as NAND customers are investing in leading-edge technology to advance their competitive and cost strategies. ","Finally, though DRAM investment remained modest in the March quarter, our second half calendar forecast for 2012 shows higher levels of DRAM investment. DRAM industry CapEx is expected to remain focused primarily on technology migrations. ","Now to provide some perspective on the industry landscape for the remainder of calendar 2012. Growth from mobility markets, the high pace of innovation at the leading edge and competitive dynamics are all driving a high level of capital investment by our customers and sustaining a healthy business environment with strong order momentum. ","In this environment, KLA-Tencor continues to perform at a high level with strong adoption on our core markets and strengthening market position, driving greater-than-industry growth rate for the company. ","Looking ahead to the remainder of calendar 2012, current industry forecast predict that demand for capital equipment will continue to be strong and will remain focused on capacity ramps in the leading edge, logic and foundry, with technology development remaining a priority for market leaders across all of our end markets. ","As a result, another good year for capital equipment spending is expected in the year, with total industry capital investment now projected to be flat to down 5% compared with a very strong 2011. Given this industry backdrop and with our backlog, the high demand for our new products and adoption at the leading edge, we are currently projecting revenue growth for KLA-Tencor in the 2012 calendar year that significantly outpaces the industry. ","Turning now to our guidance for the June quarter. The Q4 demand picture looks similar to the March quarter, with the investment focused on leading edge technology development and concentrated among the market leaders, with continued strong momentum among the foundry and logic customers. ","Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $775 million to $950 million. We are also projecting revenue and earnings growth with the June quarter expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.38. ","In conclusion, we see calendar 2012 as another year of industry-leading growth and financial performance for KLA-Tencor, as our market leadership, our new products and the increasing adoption of process control all position the company to continue to perform at a higher level. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers and the outlook. Mark?","Mark P. Dentinger","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll remind you that we present our income statement in 2 formats: one, under U.S. GAAP; and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring related charges and credits, and any costs of credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. ","There was a $0.06 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information. Where I mention GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction.","Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. ","Q3 new orders were $833 million. Net orders were $816 million and were down about 14% from last quarter. ","The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 22% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 8% of new systems orders, up from 2% in Q2; Japan was 11%, up from 9% last quarter; Korea was 39%, up from 28% last quarter; Taiwan was 13%, down from 39% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 7%, up from 3% in Q2. ","The distribution in new orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 54%, compared with 47% last quarter; reticle inspection was 6%, down from 13% last quarter; metrology was 19%, down from 22% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 4%, up from 3% last quarter; and service was 17% of new orders in Q3, up from 15% last quarter. ","Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 55% of new systems orders in Q3 were for foundry customers, compared with 57% in Q2; logic customers were 16% of new semi-orders in Q3 versus 27% in Q2; and memory orders were 29% in Q3, up from 16% last quarter. ","Looking forward, we expect new orders for Q4 will be within a range of $775 million to $950 million. In Q3, we shipped $818 million versus $700 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $820 million and $880 million in Q4. ","Total backlog at the end of Q3 decreased by $23 million from December 31, and we ended the quarter with about $1.34 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2012, included $313 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped. ","Total revenue for Q3 was $841 million, up 31% from $642 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q3 was up $200 million to $701 million overall, and the services revenue was $139 million, down about $3 million from Q2. Our expected Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million. ","Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3% in the March quarter, down slightly from 58.4% last quarter, as margin improvement from higher revenue was offset by product mix and product transition-related inventory reserves. ","For Q4, we are expecting gross margins between 58.5% and 59.5%. Operating expenses were $199 million in Q3, compared with $207 million in Q2. Research expenses were $109 million in Q3, down $6 million from Q2, driven by the timing of materials for purchases for next-generation platforms. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $90 million in Q3, down almost $2 million from Q2. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be up slightly from Q3. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, down about $2 million from Q2. The change in OIE from last quarter was mostly related to a $1 million charge in Q2 to write down a nonmarketable investment. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q4. ","In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $65 million, or 23% of pretax income versus 22% rate in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are using our intermediate term planning rate of 26% in arriving at Q4 non-GAAP EPS. ","Non-GAAP net income was $216 million, or $1.27 per share in Q3, up from $0.72 a share last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 26%, Q3 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.22 per share. At the revenue range I previously mentioned in using a tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.20 and $1.38 per share. The weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q3 was $170.1 million versus $169.1 million in Q2. ","During Q3, we spent $67 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares. And as of March 31, 2012, we had approximately 4.6 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. ","We also paid $59 million in dividends in Q3. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q4. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $171 million for Q4. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at just under $2.4 billion, up about $190 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $262 million in Q3, compared with $187 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $638 million, up from $544 million at the end of December. ","DSOs were 69 days at March 31 versus 77 days at December 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in foundry .","Net inventories increased by $11 million from December 31 and ended the quarter at $659 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAPP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q3 versus 1.7 turns in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3, down $1 million from Q2. Total headcount, March 31, 2012, was 5,655, up from 5,593 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4. ","In summary, our guidance for Q4 is: new orders between $775 million and $950 million; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million and non-GAAP earnings between $1.20 and $1.38 per share, assuming a tax rate of 26%. ","This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] ","And so, Steven, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the pushout that you talked about whether in logic, foundry or memory. Was the pushout related to end demand or was it related to other constrains like availability of other equipment like lithography or facilities? How should we think about that?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. The pushout was actually just a timing issue, and the orders have since been processed. So it was really not related to any end demand, just getting things through your system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rick, In terms of the foundries that are placing these huge CapEx numbers, from your vantage point, do you think that it's a mixture of both true end demand as well as improvement in yield? Or do you think the yield has a preload run rate if the CapEx does to increase to meet the demand? And I had a follow-up, too.","Richard P. Wallace","I think it is definitely the case. Our customers have a lot of demand for leading edge in the foundry world, and I think that's driving a lot of the activity we're seeing. And the yields, 32 nanometers are not great, and they're lower than that at 28. And I think there's also development work driving business for us at 20 nanometers. So -- and I have met with most of them in the last 90 days. And for sure, they're seeing strong demand based on kind of broad-based market pull, whether it be 4G or LTE chip sets, graphics, or processors, to support mobility, and it's at multiple customers. But there's certainly yield issues associated with both metrology and inspection, which is why I think KLA-Tencor's performing disproportionally well in this environment.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could squeeze a follow-up for Mark. You said the OpEx is increasing in June. How do we think of that going forward or how do we think about the incremental operating margin going forward as you start doing other investments?","Mark P. Dentinger","Yes, 2 responses to that. The OpEx, we're anticipating at least based upon what we know today that the OpEx will continue to increase into next year as we prepare for a next-generation product development. It's probably going to be more pronounced on the research and development side than it is on the G&A side, but there will be a little bit of G&A growth as well. I still think you're looking at a few million dollars of quarter increase, as we move into next year. At least that's our mindset as of today. If things change, we'd certainly update you, but that's certainly our framework for today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When I look at the composition of your orders that you reported, it seems like there was a follow-up in logic orders but conversely a pickup in some of the memory orders. Can you describe the composition of these memory orders and what you're seeing in general in terms of behavior among your memory customers?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, sure, Terence. I think that you're right. We saw memory picked up to about 29%. And if you look back in December, we're at 16%. So pretty significant increase there, largely in NAND and mostly technology-related dealing with some of the new yield challenges they have and metrology challenges at the advanced node. Logic, we did see lower logic, and I think that it's always -- logic tends to be kind of lumpy because there aren't that many players, and it's just where we are in the order cycle with them. And in fact, we don't see logic getting stronger as we go out in the June quarter. Probably, it'd be later in the year before we see logic pick up. So I think for now, in fact, we're forecasting logic down even further as a percent of total next quarter, with foundry actually picking back up.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as a quick follow-up, do you expect the second half memory orders to be stronger than the first half?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. We do see some signs of strengthening in DRAM for technology. I wouldn't say for capacity. And we'll see a little bit of that in the June quarter, as we forecast a little bit more activity going forward in DRAM. And I think the second half, again, technology-related, we do expect memory to pick up some, but we also see strength in the foundries. And as I said, we'll see logic, we believe, coming later in the calendar year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Olga calling in for C.J. Just a follow-up on the 2 previous questions. You highlighted pretty solid visibility for foundry strengths through the rest of the year, expectations for logic to pick up in the second half and memory as well. So on a NAND basis, can you just talk about how you expect shipment and orders to be weighted first half versus second half?","Richard P. Wallace","You know, we really -- we're not in a great position to guide for the entire year. But when we do look out, we see CapEx in general for the year to be flattish to maybe down a few percent. And so from that standpoint, when you look back at the 2 compares, you do have to see some overall strengthening happening in the second half. And with our backlog situation, the model we gave, the guidance we gave for the next quarter, I think you could see we're normally at a book-to-bill about 1, if you take the midpoint on those ranges. And so we expect to be able to continue to do that. But probably we'd like to support our customer base as we think about the demands they have to ramp quickly. So all our efforts are on ramping, manufacturing, and we're really supply-constrained right now to be able to support our customer base.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then specific to, I guess, process control intensity, given the continued yield issues that foundry and you've recently highlighted yield issues emerging in the NAND side as well, could we see process control intensity actually exceed 15% this year, or would it still be in the 14% to 15% range?","Richard P. Wallace","I think it's hard to get that precise on it as we go forward. I think it does depend somewhat on the complexion of the different customers that we're working in and their timing. But we've definitely seen since last year -- through last year, we saw an increase in intensity. Some customers are further along in their understanding of their challenges than others. There are a couple of other sectors that are low right now from a process control standpoint that we expect to pick up late in the year. And those -- reticle inspection is not particularly strong right now, and that's more just driven by the dynamics of that market. And the wafer manufacturers are not strong. So kind of in those 2 realms, we think there's more opportunity for intensity to increase. But that's not really happening in our next 90-day outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I do apologize if you touched on this. I was a little late hopping over from one of the other calls, but it's kind of a bigger picture question. Just you guys are uniquely positioned, I think, to comment on some of the differences and some of the similarities between the yield issues that happened at 45-nanometer, especially at some of the foundry customers and then the yield issues that are happening today. What do you think is similar? What do you think is different about these yield challenges that those customers are facing in this cycle?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I think, mainly, probably the bigger one is related to metrology. I think that there are a number of challenges people are facing in yield in general that we saw at 45, which plays to the defectivity. But there are some uniqueness associated with the metrology product lines that we have with multiple patterning happening and increased intensity and some of the 3D thin FET structures driving more metrology. So I'd say that the intensity goes up, and it's driven as much by increase in metrology as it is by the ongoing challenges of defectivity.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So -- I'm sorry. I think understood that, but the issue just -- from KLA-Tencor standpoint, it's just the issues that they're facing require more metrology than the issues the 45-nanometer yield challenges created. Is that what you're saying?","Richard P. Wallace","Exactly. Metrology is a bit more stressed than it was at 45, which is I think why the overall intensity goes up.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. And is there a simple way to explain the technical issue that drives that increase in metrology?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, the fact that you have to do multiple patterning because EUV is late. And I think that they're definitely more critical layers which just drive -- so the requirements for overlay and the requirements for FinFET drive more metrology. There's also strong defectivity, but we had strong defectivity challenges back at 45 as well. That's what kickstarted a lot of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Rick, just a follow-up on the last question. Is the mix of architecture types that are going through the foundries -- big die, consumer chips, et cetera, is that a material factor in some of the yield issues? Or is it more around the node transition and less about particular architectures, be it graphics or processors, et cetera?","Richard P. Wallace","No, it's definitely related to die size and geometry, Raj. You have both things happening, and I think it's more analogous to what happened to processors, microprocessors, in the '90s when they were getting both larger die but at the same time smaller dimensions. We're seeing that in mobility, driven by slightly different factors. One is a drive for less power. But it is definitely the case that the die are getting bigger and the yield challenges associated with that more pronounced, especially as they go to smaller design rules.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A quick follow-up if I might. The comment you made on the trajectory in the second half, what were you suggesting about the order trajectory? I think I understood what you said on shipments. But were the orders being expected flattish or would they be down? And does that include the incremental TSMC spending that they announced today?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, Raj, it's -- I mean, as I said, we don't like to model what the second half is going to look like at this point. It's really tough for us. But we do see a lot of good indicators out there in terms of the conversations we're having with customers in both the foundry space -- and there are many people who said foundries were going to fall off 3 quarters ago, and we see ongoing strength. And I think it's driven by this mobility drive. We have multiple players supporting that, including a big foundry increasing their CapEx today. We don't that is necessarily the end of that. But at the same time, we do have some opportunities because of the process challenges associated with the latest generation NAND and what we believe will be in DRAM. So on balance, I also think there's some capacity opportunities as we get wafer manufacturers turned back on, and that's going to take a while. But we're -- it's too soon to model. We have an overall view for the year relative to last year, flat to down 5. But I don't want to get into a specific guidance for the second half at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","You mentioned supply chain constraints. I'm just wondering if your lead times are starting to extend at this point? And if so, what are they? And I was also hoping to -- can you sort of characterize your bookings concentration among your customers? Is it broadening out or is it still fairly concentrated with 1 or 2 customers?","Richard P. Wallace","Okay I'll take the 2 in the order you gave them. The first one, the supply constraints are really driven by the ability to get parts. It's not so much our space issues or talent. We've got the people. It's a matter of pulling the supply chain, and we've had a dramatic ramp. For us, it's kind of the usual suspects. It's going to be around optics. It's around illumination sources, whether they'd be laser or broadband. And it's really related to critical components which have longer lead time. And we've done -- and our suppliers have done a great job of ramping up to support us, but demand far exceeded what we had originally modeled. So we're playing catch-up. I would say that we're doing a good job of that. In terms of order, breadth is really among the logic and foundry players, and it's broad among logic and foundries as it was last quarter. What's slower, and we saw a little bit pickup in memory, but what's slower is there's just not a lot of action in DRAM. We do expect to see some of that. There's not much in the wafer manufacturers. There's not much, actually, in the reticle manufacturers right now. And so it is broad among foundries and logic on advanced nodes; not really very broad anywhere else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Blansett with JPMorgan.","William C. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Bill Peterson calling in for Chris. When looking in -- if you look at back maybe a year ago compared to the revenue run rates these days, it looks like the gross margins are around 100, maybe to 200 basis points lower. Can you provide any color around that? Is it related to customer mix, product mix? You're alluding to, for example, a lack of reticle and wafer. But I'm wondering what are the key moving parts within that?","Mark P. Dentinger","Yes. Bill, this is Mark. You actually hit on one of them. We're categorizing mix, the customer mix, which includes the merge mashups [ph]. And we are seeing in terms of the margin pressure that we've experienced and this went up versus a year ago, Basically, it's mostly attributable to product mix. There is a little bit of volume component in terms of the big customers, and at least in this quarter, we had a product transition that pressured the inventory reserves a little bit more than what we've experienced in at least the last 5 or 6 quarters. So a combination of those 3 factors. But I would largely attribute it to the mix of products that we're shipping right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just talk about the concentration of orders by different segments of foundries -- foundry, memory and logic, in the June quarter? And also, with respect to 20 nanometers spending, are you seeing just one customer spending or placing orders on that node? Or are you seeing multiple customers on that as well?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I'll take those in reverse order. We're definitely seeing multiple on 20 nanometer, but they're different stages, I would think of maturity. But we are seeing R&D related work for 20. In terms of forecasting what we see right now for June by end customer, memory we think is around 21%. With actually, most of that being, as we're forecasting right now, DRAM related. Logic at 12%, and foundry picking back up to 67% percent, and the non-semi at about 5%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Rick. So when you talked about significant outperformance in calendar 12, how should we think about in terms of your individual product lines between wafer inspection, metrology and reticle inspection? And I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think we're doing pretty well across the board in terms of relative -- when we look at market share. We're talking more in general about the overall performance KLA-Tencor from a revenue perspective relative to the overall industry, where we see process control strengthening as we go forward for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. But also we have gained share, and so that puts us at a great position to support our customers as we go forward. There are great opportunities for us in metrology. I mentioned the double patterning, more layers, but also the challenges of defectivity. So right now, it's pretty broad. As I said earlier, I think the areas that are slower, that may pick up but won't then be on for most of this calendar year, relate to wafer manufacturers. And there's been some softening in overall investment by the reticle manufacturers at this point, which may pick up later in the year.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And on the -- one of your key customers is starting to work on the 40-nanometer, and you guys are well exposed on the R&D side. Where do you see clearly this would become incremental opportunities that could drive particularly in the second half? Any specific details on that one?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think that the advanced node work continues to challenge our customers. There's definitely work on now with 40-nanometer. When we think about the early phases of development, it tends to favor tools like the very advanced wafer inspection tools. Sometimes the e-Beam tools will get pulled into that. And there are -- we do have tools that are perhaps more related to capacity, and those tend to come during the ramp phase as opposed to the development phase. But we are seeing that demand right now and working closely with our customers on the tool sets to support their R&D.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the reticle inspection. When do you think it can bounce back?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, probably not for a couple of quarter. I mean we had a strong placement of a number of the 6xx  product line when we introduced that. We're doing very well from a share perspective, but we do forecast another relatively softer quarter in the June, and we would expect in the second half to see more activity in reticle. But right now, it is definitely lower than it has been in prior quarters. Because of the size of those orders and the capital intensity of that equipment, that tends to be pretty lumpy, and we forecast that going forward as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of quick questions. The first one, I'm just curious, looking longer-term over the next 2 or 3 years, I'm wondering if you can give us an idea which process control markets are most optimistic about in terms of growth or profit contribution.","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think that the dynamics of foundry continue to play to KLA-Tencor. I think we're an important ingredient in anybody that's running at a high-mix environment and has a lot of process change. And I think that overall dynamics of the mobility markets support our business pieces that they're going to need more inspection than measurement. I would say that the DRAM less intensive and probably not a huge contributor to our progress going forward. I think that NAND, however, is because of the technology associated with, especially the 3D NAND work that's going on. So if I had to pick -- and logic continues to be, but logic, of course, is starting to blur with foundry if you look at the dynamics. I think over 2 to 3 years, logic looks more like foundry as the main logic players move to support the mobility market. And I think for us, the strength will be in those markets, less so in the DRAM market.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And how about just from a equivalent standpoint or a segment standpoint or segment standpoint, which products are you most optimistic about in terms of generating growth?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I think that the demonstrated value that we've seen in our metrology, especially around multiple patterning, which drives both the overlay business and registration business but also the films business, is strong. I don't see any change in that because the complexity associated with that goes. And then defectivity. I think that there's no question that our strength in technology advancement in both the main platforms there, the Brightfield, the Darkfield, but also the bare wafer, are all well positioned to support advanced technology nodes. So I wouldn't say one is particularly stronger than the other when it comes to those 3 categories. But we do see big opportunities, and we're seeing it now when we provide more capability on the advanced design rules' defectivity. A lot of it is customers then learn what they've been missing, and that's part of what caught us by surprise with the big demand is they got a hold of a new technology. And of course, we heavily investing in R&D, and we'll be bringing out next-generation. We've got at least a 5-year roadmap mapped out in our key product lines, where we have developments going on that will be bringing out new capabilities to support the market as we go forward.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, if I could just real quickly on the service revenue line. That's trended down for 3 quarters, it looks like. I'm just wondering if that starts to flatten out, maybe improved through the back half of the year?","Mark P. Dentinger","Yes, I'd be happy to talk to that. A couple of things are happening there. First of all, we did have the OPD interruption this quarter, which cost us about $3 million in the top line. The second thing is that where we lightened up over the last, I would say, 2 to 3 quarters, is in what we call our billable work, which is where customers aren't on contracts. Most of the new tool customers are buying contracts that come along so that they can service the tool in its most intense initiation period of usage. So we do think that at least part of that effect was when Japan went through the tsunami last year. We had an intense increase in that particular region in billable. That has now subsided, that those customers have stabilized. So we suspect that we will begin to grow in the services revenue line in our fiscal Q4. We would expect that the growth to return to sort of normal trajectories as we move into next year. But those 2 phenomenon did have an impact on us over the last 2 to 3 quarters.","Richard P. Wallace","And to just add to that, I think that you're well aware that utilization at the leading edge is very high. But the utilization at the trailing edge is actually softer and that more tightly correlates to the service business than the leading edge does. So the systems business outperforms during that time period, in addition to the factors that Mark highlighted.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of this Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on your thoughts of technology upgrades versus capacity expansion in NAND. If you compare the state of foundry, logic is capacity-driven now. Memory is technology-driven now. But both could be more capacity-heavy as that we haven't -- the second half of the year? Is that kind how you're planning KLA?","Richard P. Wallace","Stephen, right. I think that's generally -- I might modify it a little. There's no question that there is technology happening in the foundries as well. Particularly in the areas of the advance design rules and that's a big catalyst for growth for us. But no question that memory right now is about technology, and it's also where we see capacity when we talk about the wafer manufacturers, which have been very, very slow. The only purchases we've seen in our wafer manufacturers have been associated with technology, indicating that we believe there'll be opportunity once they, too, resume their growth. But right now, there's -- it's all about technology. And I'd say the one kind of in the middle is NAND as it deals with advanced technology, and we're hoping to see some improvement in capacity later on NAND.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, if you look at the order guidance, if you didn't have that pushout with your order guidance have pretty much just been flat then at the midpoint?","Richard P. Wallace","I think that's right.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you talk about the DRAM strength, are you just talking about the June quarter or do you have some visibility beyond the June quarter on DRAM?","Richard P. Wallace","We don't have a lot of visibility beyond it. We do see some June activity. But as you know, I'm sure you know, there've been a couple of disruptions in DRAM, if you just look at some of the players that have caused to able to tap the brakes. One player didn't have really any access to capital, and the other one had a big financial problem. So that kind of froze everybody. Since then, you have one that's going through the process, and we think there'll be some resolution when it comes to the bankruptcy in Elpida, and the other one is merger completed in Korea, which means at least some of the CapEx. So we'll see technology, we're definitely seeing signs of that in the current quarter, and then we expect that later in the year, we'll see some resumption of capacity investment or more technology. But we're not talking about big numbers. I mean, it's been almost off. So we're talking about off of a very low base.","Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one final one. On the reticle inspection, you commented that, I guess, it will be slow for the a little while before you expect to see it pick up. Is the pick up around 22 nanometers then? Is 28 nanometer essentially done for reticle inspection?","Richard P. Wallace","I think there's 2 ways to think about it. There's definitely -- there's some truth about that the -- we sold a number of our 6xx series. The other thing is there is going to be some fab line business that becomes available. But when the yields are low on the advanced design rule, there's less business in the fab for some of the reticle business, so we see less business there until the yield issues really get ramped. And so I think that those are kind of 2 factors associated with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Co.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Rick, so I noticed that your metrology order is down for the quarter. Was that due to just timing or is this specifically related to certain end market? Can you help us over that?","Richard P. Wallace","We're down but above -- down quarter-on-quarter, but they're running a little bit higher than they had historically. I think it was also -- frankly, the strength of the wafer inspection makes it as a percent come up. But yes, there's timing associated with that. Some of that we'll see as we go forward. And then it's also associated with some strength in wafer displacing NAND.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I see. It's just a mix issue then. And then a question on the NAND side, I guess some of your peers has talked about NAND looks like it's going to be softer this year than a lot of, I guess, a lot of you were predicting for the year. Have you guys seen that softness in NAND or do you think you might not see that because you're more tied to margins than [indiscernible] these capacities [indiscernible] can you help us out on that?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, there's no question on NAND. On capacity, it has been slow, and we don't expect that to change much. Where we have seen some business and had a reasonable quarter in the March quarter was associated technology, but as we said, going forward, even in the June quarter, we expect to see NAND as a smaller percentage of a smaller number. So I agree that we don't see a tremendous amount of investment in NAND either except for some technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think Rick, you may have kind of touched on this in one of the prior questions. I just want to get it clear. With some of the challenges emerging in memory manufacturing, particularly on the NAND side of things, where vertical NAND structures are forthcoming. Where do you see the process control intensity for you guys in terms of either metrology and inspection? Do you see metrology getting the bulk of those increased dollars or are there inspection opportunities as well?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, so there's 2 sides of it. One is the overlay challenges and the 3D structures when it comes to making film measurements are both going to drive metrology for us. When it comes to the defectivity associated with the advanced design rules, just smaller device but also the VNAND structure creates opportunity for the wafer inspection. The other thing we've seen is some opportunity for bare wafer into memory in places where we haven't necessarily seen adoption in the past. So we think that's some good opportunity for us to penetrate further in those markets. So I'd say the mix is pretty good, given that wafer is overall larger percent of our business than metrology. I think you'd probably equal weighting and increase in opportunity, which means the mix stays similar. But both go up as a result of the process complexity. And that's based on the preliminary data we're seeing now and what we're working with customers in their development.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Two follow-up. I'm just trying to understand the dynamics of this pushout from March to June. And I apologize in advance if I'm beating the dead horse. But when I look at what we have heard from your customers and the customer's customers over the past couple of weeks, it seems like one measure of fabless company would have to redo the layout and come up with a new reticle set or mask set. Is that what could explain what led to this pushout?","Richard P. Wallace","No. The pushouts were related to just transferring of information and data, some pickups in IT. And we have since book the orders.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then June quarter has historically been your strongest quarter. So this push from March to June mix, this June quarter even bigger than historical trends and things of sequential changes?","Richard P. Wallace","Possibly. I mean, as we have a pretty wide range on June capturing that. Couple of things have happened. One, we're in pretty big numbers for us. And we're talking about a not that large customer base, which has always been true but it's especially true now. And so you have large orders from a few customers creating a large range and a certain amount of uncertainty. The thing that does give us some confidence is there's a high demand for spots, and so for us to be able to respond to support our customers, so we think we'll get more clarity as the quarter goes on. But I think as we have seen in the last few quarters, it's getting harder for us to have much visibility although we see demand just because we have a fewer number of buying a larger percent of the order book. And so I would say we're going to -- it will be right down to the wire and as it was at the end of March, and that's why we've given such a large range.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Would be fair to say that the visibility for your customers will actually become even more challenging later this year because there could be a process as they determine or evaluate what the demand would be next year. So could that lead to sort of a pause in booking patterns because visibilities are very limited and orders have become very lumpy?","Richard P. Wallace","I don't think so. I think that we're at kind of a pretty narrow visibility now, and I don't think it will get much worse. The only exception I would give you that the caveat is if you go back to a market situation where there is macroeconomic shock, then our bets are off. But I think we're living in a world now where our customers are driven by consumers. Many of our customers are not producing for their own needs but producing as foundries, and therefore, they have less visibility and therefore, we have less visibility. And I think it's unfortunately the new normal because I think foundries will dominate the CapEx spending because they're the ones really benefiting the most from the mobility work, which is where most of the business -- semiconductor growth certainly looks to be for the next several years.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood. You may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Mariana. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2016. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com. A final cast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release at KLA-Tencor's IR website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In those filings you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks; any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Wallace","Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce the KLA-Tencor's business continues to perform at a very high level. And we delivered another outstanding result in the December quarter, exceeding our guidance for shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period. In addition, new orders topped $1 billion for the first time in Q2, reflecting KLA-Tencor's market leadership and the critical process control plays and enabling our customers' success at the leading edge, and in legacy notes.","For the full year in calendar 2016 KLA-Tencor grew revenue 14% compared to mid-to high-single digit growth for the wafer fabrication industry. Our example rate performance both in the December quarter and for the full year in 2016, as a result of KLA-Tencor's market leadership and coupled with our record backlog of over $1.6 billion sets the stage for another year of strong top line and earnings growth for the Company in calendar 2017.","As our record order and backlog numbers demonstrate, KLA-Tencor is experiencing unprecedented levels of demand in our end markets, particularly in foundry and memory. Memory was notable strong in the December quarter driven by both DRAM and 3D NAND investments in Korea where we are experiencing higher adoption of bear wafer inspection along within thin turn and critical dimension measurement solutions, as a result of more firms paying deposited in vertical memory.","KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership is fueled by the successful execution of a product strategy that is focused on differentiation and intersecting market needs with the portfolio of complimentary solutions. This ongoing investment innovation and technology leadership help to drive these strong results in 2016, and as a critical component for our long-term growth strategies.","For example KLA-Tencor's two latest broadband plasma optical inspection platforms Gen 4 and Gen 5, together address the most challenging defect detection issues for development and capacity monitoring application of current and next generation devices in the marketplace today. We are now on our fourth major product upgrade for the Gen 4 optical inspection platform with multiple tools placed in every advanced production fab in the marketplace","And one of the key highlights of the year in 2016 was the successful launch of Gen 5, our new flagship broadband plasma inspection platform. Gen 5 is being deployed by customers to address early yield learning and engineering analysis applications for advanced optical lithography design rules and for EUV development. Calendar 2016 was a record year for the broadband plasma product family, and we see momentum continuing through 2017. In addition to the supplying wafer inspections capability for EUV layers, KLA-Tencor is also playing a critical role in radical inspection for EUV.","Our customers are relying on assets interested partner to enable success of the important technology transition to EUV, a move that will allow for lateral scaling and more economical device roadmaps at the leading edge. The new challenges and inherent to EUVs specific process control applications such as mask inspection, radical requalification and scanner control just to name the few present new market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address. Given our market and leadership in technology, EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for growth that the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor.","So to summarize KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2016 results demonstrates are strategies are working and the Company is operating from the position of strength as we've entered into another year of expected strong growth and earnings generation, given the business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, ranking KLA-Tencor's among the top tier of leading semiconductor companies, and with our strong leadership position in each of the most critical process control markets.","The stage is set to build on the momentum of calendar 2016 and deliver what we plan to be another exciting year in 2017. We believe KLA-Tencor's is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and meet or exceed our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7% in 2017 and what is expected to be another year of solid growth for the wafer fab equipment market.","Now turning to the guidance for the March quarter, Q3 shipments are expected to be in the range of $850 million to $930 million. Revenue for the quarter expected to be in the range of $860 million to $920 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.42 per share to $1.62 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments, revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio with particular strength in our flagship wafer and mass inspection product lines as well as solid execution and cost management in our manufacturing and service operations.","Revenue was 877 million in the December quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.52, and would have been a $1.57 per share at the 21% guided tax rate, GAAP earnings per share was also $1.52. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now turning to the highlights of the December quarter demand environment, although we're no longer guiding quarterly orders we'll continue to share our perspective on the quarterly -- current quarterly end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends and KLA-Tencor's performance. We eventually plan to provide end market mix detail for shipments results and guidance and expect to have that information available once we complete an upgrade of our internal analysis systems sometime in the Company few quarters.","At that time our end market customer mix, business segment and regional breakdowns will be provided on the shipment basis. In the interim, we'll continue to provide additional detail on order mix by end market. New orders in the December quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Memory was 61% in the orders and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We're currently modeling memory orders to be 34% of the total in the March quarter.","Foundry was 37% in new system orders in December also as expected, and Foundry is forecasted to grow to 63% of orders in March. We're currently modeling solid growth in Foundry orders in the first half of calendar '17 fueled by 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development from multiple foundry customers, and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. Logic was 2% in new system orders and is currently forecasted to be at a comparable level in the March quarter.","In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the fourth quarter, wafer inspection was 45% to new system orders, patterning was 35%. Patterning includes orders from our radical inspection business. Service was 18%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. New orders in the first half of calendar year 2017 are expected to be roughly flat compared with the second half of calendar '16.","Total shipments were 887 million in the quarter and just above the guided range for the quarter of 800 million to 880 million. Looking forward we're modeling March quarter shipments to be approximately flat at the mid-point compared with December and be in the range 850 million to 930 million. Our current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels at around 900 million for the next few quarters.","Turning now to income statement, as I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 877 million in December, finishing above the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $860 million to $920 million in the March quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.8% and a new quarterly record for the Company.","The better than model gross margin performance in December is largely a function of strong product mix on the incremental revenue delivered in the quarter and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the March quarter, down slightly versus the December quarter due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter.","Going forward we expect to deliver gross margin results of couple of hundred basis points above our published business model target due to a number of factors including product positioning, new product introduction execution and cost management. We are currently forecasting gross margin in calendar '17 to be approximately 62% plus or minus 50 basis points.","Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared with September and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. We are modeling operating expense levels of between $220 million and $225 million in the March quarter and in the range of $900 million and $920 million for the full year in calendar '17. Given our gross margin expectations, we continue to deliver operating margins at the upper end or above our published model for foreseeable future.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.5% in the quarter, above our previously guided long-term planning rate of 21% reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products manufacturing in the U.S. and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. We are planning to this product mix trend to continue through calendar '17, which will put some pressure on the tax rate. We assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes. Finally, net income for the December quarter was 238 million and in the end of the quarter was 157 million fully dilutes shares outstanding.","I'll turn now the highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investment end of the quarter 2.6 billion, an increase of approximately 100 million compared with the September quarter. Cash from operations was 222 million in the quarter. And free cash flow with 214 million. In December, we paid in aggregate of 85 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units, and made a supplemental payment of 40 million towards our outstanding term loans.","To date, the total amount of payments of principally on our term loan has amounted to approximately $254 million since it was added in the December quarter 2014. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor result in December reflect our market leadership the critical nature of process control and our customers gross strategies at the leading edge and in legacy designed rules and our industry leading business model. This coupled with almost 1.1 billion in new orders in the December quarter positioned the Company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '17.","Current forecast for the wafer fab equipment market to grow mid-single digit in 2017. Against this industry backdrop, we are modeling the Company's revenue to grow slightly better than the broader market. This performance demonstrates the Company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of portfolio solutions addressing the most critical yield requirement to leading edge and our operational core confidences.","Given our record backlog and expectations for new orders, KLA-Tencor is well positioned for another year of solid growth in 2017. With that to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is shipments in the range of 850 million to 930 million, revenue between $860 million and $920 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.42 to $1.62 per share with GAAP EPS of $1.40 to $1.60 per share.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay, thank you Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for questions, and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today's call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to participate in today's call as time.","All right, Mariana, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Rick, I wanted to get a sense of obviously memory orders were really, really strong at quarter. You guys have talked about that being the case. Is that more cyclical? Or is there something secular going on? And I guess I'm particularly asking about 3D NAND because seems like you guys maybe preparing a new solution that's going to help to improve yields there. So, I'm sort of wondering maybe what your outlook generally is for how your exposures are going to grow in memory? Thanks.","Rick Wallace","Thanks, Tim. Yes, we have some success recently with 3D NAND. I think both in terms of existing products, which we're finding more application as our customers. First, the technology is being more broadly deployed by our customer base. And the second is some of the yield challenges they are facing. We think leader in the calendar year will actually have more offerings to support 3D NAND. So, we think, if we execute properly by the end of '17, we should have a larger adoption of inspection to 3D NAND. So, we think that there is upside to our current levels of concentration now.","Timothy Arcuri","And I guess, Bren, question for you. Everybody else likes to put up their financial models and link their revenue to wafer fab equipment. I know it's a little harder for you because it depends on the mix. But if WFE is going to be 37 billion, yesterday, we haven't talked about that. Can you talk a little bit -- can you try to math for us WFE or your revenue relative to WFE? It seems like if you don\u2019t take any share at all, it seems like you could do 3.7 billion pretty easily at 37 billion environment. So, I'm just wondering if you can math revenue your model to WFE? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","Yes, Tim it's a good question. I mean as we look at calendar 2017, we think WFE is probably up somewhere in the mid-single digits. When we do our math, we end-up somewhere around 36 billion. And so against that backdrop, as I said in the prepared remarks, we think that we should do better than the broader market, so somewhere in the high single digit growth rate versus calendar 2016. So we feel pretty good about that. I also said in the prepared remarks that over the next few quarters, we expect it will be shipping consistently in an around 900 million.","I think as we get further out into the second half of the year through December, I think I've got pretty visibility to my bill plans through September. And as we get to the December, we will see how the second half order book ultimately feels out, but I think we are going to position for a good year and I think depending on how the second half plays out particularly around December. The numbers that you are mentioning aren\u2019t inconceivable to see, if that were to play out that way. But I think as the down, as I said we based on a mid single digit type growth rate, we think will do -- we should do better than the broader industry for the second consecutive year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad","My first question is on EUV. Rick, you've mentioned that you're seeing a good activity for Gen 5 being deployed both for OPC and EUV development. Can you talk about what progress you're seeing there? And how far along do you think you're in the qualification process? And is that something that can materialize in 2018 in meaningful way?","Rick Wallace","EUV, we've had some momentum based on the fact that there's more activity going on in development and in multiple places, multiple sides for our customers, and also the fact that Gen 5 is now out and being deployed especially in the area of qualifying the images that are been printed by EUV lithography. I also mentioned that in mask, we have some success with the 6XX platform that we've serving the EUV mask qualification market, and we think that as the activity continues to pick up on EUV that that part of our business should grow over the next couple of years.","With the expectations of high volume manufacturing of EUV by 2019 or 2020, we'll continue to see ramping of those capabilities, and we'll move from characterization to be more part of the production flow as we get out into those out years. And we should see adoption of things like Gen 5 especially in the back end of the line supporting the ramps, middle end and back end of the line supporting ramps as EUV comes into production.","Farhan Ahmad","And then one question on the 3D NAND that you've mentioned for back half of the year, could you give us some sense of how big is the growth opportunity for you in 3D NAND, maybe just in terms of like what portion of the market do you address currently? And what sort of opportunity the new products can bring?","Rick Wallace","Well, Farhan, I think you know we've talked about essentially memory being at about half the adoption rate of foundry in terms of process control adoption; however, it tends to grow faster in many respects for two reasons. One, it looks like there's more capability certainly that we can bring to solve some existing problems that people are not using process control to solve right now, and that I think we can grow that adoption.","So, we think that the adoption and or the process control intensity grows in 3D NAND depending on how much ongoing investment there is that sets that market size. But we think it can contribute to our overall outperformance of the industry. 3D NAND recently process control intensity has kind of mapped to what 2D plainer was, as some of the complexity of the process is being understood by our customers. So for us there's not really big difference in process control intensity for plainer versus 3D NAND, as 3D NAND is actually picking up for us as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","On the profitability profile, assuming you guys slightly outgrow the WSE market this year that would imply roughly kind of 3.5 billion in revenues. You guys drove 38% operating margins in December, 38% operating margins imply within your guidance in March. You've given us your sort of views on gross margins for the year and your level of OpEx, which would sort of in play operating margins in that sort of 36% to 37%. Last earnings call, you know of talked me down to a level of 35 percent-ish. But should we expect kind of 36% 37% operating margins on the parameters that you just gave us today? Is that kind of the way where do you think about it?","Bren Higgins","Harlan, it's Bren. Yes, in the prepared remarks I wanted -- as we head into in a year to give a little bit more perspective on how we are sizing the business. We've been doing obviously a lot of work on our strategic planning, so we've have got a deeper view and understanding of the mix of business going forward around certain products. And of course the backlog at the level that give us pretty good visibility to move to the year. So I wanted to go ahead and provide some of that information. I think the numbers that you are coming up with seem to make sense based on the numbers I provided.","I think in terms of how we are sizing the business I don\u2019t see how that changes very much going forward, significant swings would cause go up and down but in terms of where we are today versus what we expect I don\u2019t think that will change all that much. Gross margin is always a little bit with the business like ours and the mix of products we have depending on the mix of products can have some influence on gross margin both directions. But the ways you are thinking about it I think make sense and given the funnel and where we are loaded today I feel pretty comfortable with the guidance I provided.","Harlan Sur","You guys had a record year fiscal year '16 from China. It seems like there is more China domestic foundry spending coming online this year. And my question is, is China still a tailwind for KLA this calendar year? And even though these are more legacy type nodes like 20-nanometers, are these guys still tending to buy up to stock and purchasing your latest Gen 4 tools which we obviously know have richer ASPs?","Bren Higgins","They are investing for not only the nodes they are starting on, but they are also trying to invest to be able to migrate those nodes as they go forward and they expect to continue to migrate their designed ropes down. So the interest the other buying, they are not buying Gen 5, but they are buying we are seeing Gen 4 purchases. And also I think for the metrology challenge is that they feel like they are going to face, we're having pretty good penetration there. So, we feel good about China as it goes forward, it feels pretty sustainable based on the conversations we are having with customers and the successfully had to-date there.","Rick Wallace","The second half of '16 was a little bit slow on China so that wasn\u2019t digesting but as we look at calendar '17 from an order perspective I think China indigenous China our native China business will be up pretty significantly from what we experienced in '16. To reach point across a number nodes and very foundry logic centric, don\u2019t expect to see much memory investment in '17 I think that\u2019s more of 18 of them. But we think China is one of these factors why we think that at least for as we look at foundry business into '17 that we have got enough profile from not just the diversity of other customers investing to leading edge but what's happening here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Co. Your line is open.","Edwin Mok","So, first question I have is on your mass inspection product. You talk about how the customer around EUV was seeing handful to 66 products. I am curious is there a way for us to think about that, like let's not about how many chose their shipping this year. Is there anything you think about how much capacity customer will need that to take these EUV tools?","Rick Wallace","Well, historically, there has been a ratio of about EUV. We use to model about 10 scanners for a radical tool. But sometimes I could be frontend loaded when there is, we are doing development work. Part of what's interesting about the scanner is that, lot of scanners during the field the day weren\u2019t really driving much capacity any. Because I don\u2019t think they were really pushing designs very much on the EUV capabilities. We're seeing more advance designs now on EUV, and so I do think that if we go back to that ratio that's not a bad model. Even though, we are not at wavelength with this radical tool, it does seem to be a tracking relatively consistent with that.","Edwin Mok","Okay, actually that's helpful color there. And then another question I have is, one of your peers yesterday talk a lot for the bigger follow-up in the WFE in the second half of this year. And the associate would just be more frontend loaded spending in NAND. I am just curious, are you guys are seeing the same trend in the industry? Do you expect some top trend for your shipment for this year?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I think the second half looks maybe marginally weaker from a shipment perspective in the first half, we're talking about a very low single digit percentage today, and so that could change pretty quickly. So, I don\u2019t see it as a pronounce shift and then when I look through the revenue, I think revenue is sort of half-to-half in terms of how we are modeling today with the WFE assumptions I talked about earlier somewhat flattish.","So, I don\u2019t think it's a significant downtick and I have a lot of it also depends on what happens in the second half of the year around some of these other the timing of some of these other investments and I think 7-nanometer development could be wild card for us so it could strengthen into the second half and we just don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into some of that incremental business yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Chin","I actually have a question on image sensor customers. We see some higher present sales than in the past. Just wondering, if you're see anything with customers that can give us some sort of outlook on sales image sensor customers?","Rick Wallace","Image sensors that what's you are asking?","Steven Chin","Yes.","Rick Wallace","We have had good participation from -- in general, I think about the IoT, automotive markets, image sensors kind of in that category of IoT stuff, that's actually have been pretty good for us often what we see there is. If you think Gen 4, it's more or like in the inspection product line and might be Gen 3 products, supporting that. And but it's relatively episodic, so you get somebody that's investing for a particular capacity demand. So, we can't count on it every year, but it's actually have been pretty good business, when it comes along. And I think we work closely with those customers to support them when they're bringing out new technologies. So that's been a steady part of our business over the last couple of years.","Steven Chin","Thank you. And I have one follow-up. Not this only being seen as higher customer demand for 200-mm equipment. Can you talk maybe the mix that 200-mm equipment makes up for your sales? And maybe comment on this type of services revenue that you give 200-mm customer?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I think that one of the surprises, I'd say for the last several years, is the fact that 200-mm two things have happened. One, those fabs are being extended longer, and so what we are seeing as part of the supporting those customers is our service business grows. And we would have expected in a general transition to be down almost zero in terms of percent 200-mm. And I'd say probably its 5% to 10% of our business and systems now can be approaching 200.","There're also some older fabs on 300, so you kind of look at it more as the lagging technology. But yes, there's some business on the 200-mm that continues to get developed. They're not very big purchasers of capital, but they're often KLA-Tencor tools there, and it's a part of our business. There is upgrading capability and supporting them as they go forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho","Rick, a big picture question the last time you -- when we went through the industry ramp of 28-nanometers, you saw a large buying spree particularly from the leading edge, but one that also continued for several years. As we begin this transition to 10-nanometers and 7-nanometers, what is your perception of that node and could it be as large as the 28-nanometers which would give you guys, not only a near-term boost, but one that that's a little more sustainable?","Rick Wallance","It's certainly feels that way. I mean when we talk to customers, there're now multiple customers that are playing at 7-nanometers, and really no significant buys for seven right now, I mean there're 10-nanometer buys that are going to be applied to seven later. So, I think we're early days on seven, but it does feel like there'll be a wave of multiple players trying to pursue that node.","So, it's very hard for us to size it in general, but our customers seem very enthusiastic, because it's a node that gives both performance and also economic value to our customers, and there're multiple designs been started on seven. So, we feel pretty good about the extendibility of that node and the support for our business as we go forward.","Patrick Ho","And maybe, Bren, for you in terms of OpEx going forward, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about some of the new opportunities and some investments particularly as EUV gets more traction with customers out in the field. How do we look at overall R&D spending as it relates to EUV versus what you presented in your long term model?","Bren Higgins","Well, we're absolutely investing more I mean if you look at the numbers that I provided in the prepared remarks, we do think given the revenue level we have we think the opportunities that are out there, there is an opportunity for us to invest in some of these capabilities, not just in EUV, but Rick talked about 3D NAND earlier and so there's some opportunities there. In terms of EUV, there's some work going on, but as we've said and I'm sure Rick could more to this.","But as we said over the last couple of years or so, that any substantial investments to support EUV at least around the radical side of things, that we would be looking for customer participation disputed the business model dynamics there. But in terms of being able to drive higher level of sensitivity through our product portfolio, to be able to address what should be good opportunities for when you're scaling in again in the new EUV environment, we're continuing to invest as we always have to deliver that capability.","Operator","And your next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open.","Atif Malik","Rick, if I look at the size of the GPU, the graphic processor, they're about two to five X bigger than eight to ten like an application processor. Are you guys seeing a demand for your tools increase as there is intrinsically lower use on bigger die sizes to the penetration of high performance computing and the gaming?","Rick Wallace","Great question I think in the early days have some of those designs playing out 10-nanometers. Certainly, the adoption level of process control at 10-nanometers and support of those new GPU is higher as that has been in prior nodes. The question will be what happens when those ramp in terms of does the intensity come back to more historic numbers, and I think that will depend a lot on the customers' actual experience in terms of how they perform and what kind of yield they get.","But your point, in terms of course there is more value and more challenge associated with getting the larger die to yield. So, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was -- there was support. Certainly, there are more applications being applied to try to make sure that those designs work, if that is more work going on with the customers. So, we think there is a good opportunity, but it's still relatively early to know how the story plays out in terms of total adoption. In our planning, just say you understand, in our business that Bren has led out, we are not assuming the adoption goes up, we are assuming that would be upside to our plan.","Atif Malik","And then as a follow up you mentioned that you can help to improve the device yields in the 3D NAND. Can you tell us it\u2019s a basic term of what are the issues on 3D NAND leave for customer?","Rick Wallace","Well, I think the most basic way to think about it is. If you think about the way these structures are built then you are going vertical versus always horizontally shrinking, now you are not shrinking as much, but you are going deeper. There is a lot of ways that those materials will break down under the stress of manufacturing, so you'll get defects that would parkway down or all the way down the stack. And for customers, it's very hard to see those. It's very hard to understand how to improve the process.","So, part of it what happens is they have to go through destructive, that is electrical test or other means of de-processing the wafers to identify the problem. If we can visualize that for them in the fab which is different kind of inspection challenge it allows them to have fast or correct action to get the yields ramped up. So, it's not so much a size of the defect problem it's depth of defect problem and that\u2019s where we have had modified some of our technology to support that because as long as we have been in the industry it's about finding smaller defects not necessarily these very high aspect ratio defects.","Operator","Your final question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Bill Grinstead","Good afternoon guys this is Bill Grinstead in for Mehdi. Just quick question on reuse, equipment reuse as one of your customers, customers migrates probably 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer. What kind of impact you guys think that could have? Thanks.","Rick Wallace","Well, from 16 to 10, virtually no reuse. I mean that was more dynamic we saw from 20 to 16. So, you had new tools sets, you have more complicated patterning challenges. And since that you have a change in lithography and you have a change in the back in the line too. So those are all new tools. Customers always try to optimize their capital and so to the extent they can always reuse tools or any time they can it would try. So we think going forward from 10 to 7 there could potentially be some with we try to model that into how we think about it and so that's model in the and how we'd outline the financial performance for the next few quarters.","But I think if that, I think we feel pretty comfortable that what we experienced at 20 to 16 to 14 will, was a bit unique, and we won't see that going forward. Even from 10 to 7, you've got smaller or you get taller FinFETs, you've got in your new materials in the backend. You've got complicated multi-pattern in techniques, very significant process window challenges. So, we think there is a lot of additive opportunities there and as we introduce new products customers will quickly try to take up that capability and try to improve their costs to. So, I think that the new product cadence helps to insulate from some of that as well, and I think the challenge is going to or they are going to be pretty tough.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2015. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.","This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement this earnings call, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the EPS guidance and other supplemental financial information. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There, you\u2019ll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you\u2019ll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","More information regarding factors that could cause these differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, including our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Wallace","Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. KLA-Tencor delivered another quarter of solid financial performance in Q3 driven by our market leadership, our innovative portfolio of process control solutions and strong operational execution.","Financial results for Q3 were inline with our expectations, revenue in the quarter grew 9% sequentially finishing above the midpoint of our guidance at $738 million. And non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the upper end of the range at $0.84 per share driven by lower operating expenses in the period. New orders also finished in the upper end of the range of guidance in Q3 at $692 million.","These results are a good start for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2015 reflecting continued solid execution against our strategic objectives and the benefits of our ongoing focus on innovation and market leadership.","In fact, our latest industry market share data shows KLA-Tencor delivered another year of strong market leadership in the most critical areas of process control in calendar 2014 demonstrating success in our customer focus initiatives and the value of our portfolio of process control solutions.","As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is addressing our customers most critical yield challenges and the various technology transitions underway in the marketplace today including multi-patterning, new device architecture such as FinFET and 3D NAND.","Turning now to our perspective on the current market environment and thoughts on the industry landscape for the remainder of calendar 2015, first I think it's important to remind to everyone that setting aside the seemingly never ending stream of conflicting signals and uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of near term investment in the leading edge, equipment demand is generally healthy and our customers continue to drive their long-term strategies for growth led by major technology inflections at the leading edge.","But over the consolidated customer base, demand for leading edge logic and foundry limited to one or two large customers in the initial phases of a new node, the continued high class of next generation node transitions, we have come to accept a higher degree of volatility and quarterly demand, shorter leading times and the result of low visibility in the demand environment as just being part of our industry today.","But even with these factors and with caveats related to the timing of investments in the year, we still expect 2015 to be a solid - a solid demand for the equipment industry. With investment levels forecasted to be on par with what we saw in 2014 and with the potential for modest industry growth depending on the timing of some of the larger capacity RAMs that are expected in the second half of the year.","In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory investment initially focused on 20-nanometer conversions in DRAM followed by increasing 3D NAND investment in the second half of calendar 2015. The primary focus of investment for foundry in 2015 continues to be FinFET development and capacity ramp for a number of customers in addition to fill in capacity demand for 28-nanometer.","We also expect our R&D and pilot investment for the 10-nanometer design node to begin picking up in the second half of the calendar year. In this environment, process control plays a critical role enabling the successful execution of our customer's growth strategies creating opportunity for KLA-Tencor and fuelling our long-term growth. As the market leader in process control, we would expect revenue growth at least in line with the industry in the year.","In KLA-Tencor, we have an ongoing process for evaluating the company's progress in our long-term strategic objectives of customer focus growth, operational excellence and talent development.","Our goal in successfully executing these strategies is to deliver consistent growth, strong cash flows and profitability and sustain market leadership over the long-term with superior returns to our stockholders. We believe our ability to proactively get ahead of shifting customer and market dynamics as one of KLA-Tencor\u2019s competitive strength and a key differentiator for the company.","Consistent with this ongoing process, today we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce by up to 10%. This action and previous organizational alignment actions are aimed at streamlining our organization NAND business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry. Our efforts are directly - are directed and improving efficiency and removing complexity throughout our organization, streamlining our customer focus strategies and better integrating our R&D and product introduction processes.","The goal of these efforts is to deliver an increased capacity for investment in innovation and market leadership and direct our resources toward our best opportunities while enabling improved earnings power over time.","Example of various we have identified for future realignment of investment priorities includes scaling back our investment in EUV, as well as consolidating our customer facing organizations and our go-to-market strategies to better match the consolidated customer base.","We will continue to make the strategic investments necessary to fuel our long-term growth strategies and we\u2019ll also continue to proactively evaluate and adjust our plans as appropriate.","Regarding the headcount reductions we are announcing today, we are currently finalizing the details and specifics of these actions and we will have more information and details in the weeks to come.","In closing, long-term growth for KLA-Tencor is driven by the strong pace of investment in next generation semiconductor device technologies by the market leaders in logic, foundry, and memory. Process control plays a critical role in helping these customers solve the mission critical production problems associated with managing yields in the leading edge manufacturing environment.","As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from these ever more complex and costly yield challenges. As we look ahead, we are energized by the opportunities that lie ahead and optimistic that 2015 promises to be an exciting year for KLA-Tencor.","We are well positioned in key markets with innovative products to execute our strategies for growth in market leadership and to deliver strong returns to our stockholders.","Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. New orders in June are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenue guidance for Q4 is in the range of $710 million to $790 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.78 to a $1.02 per share for the quarter.","Before I conclude, I would like to thank the entire KLA-Tencor team for their continued hard work and dedication. As always, our driving focus remains on innovation and execution enabling us to meet complex customer requirements and deliver consistent solid financial results.","As we move forward we will continue to support high levels of investment and innovation to drive our market leadership, generate improved operating leverage in our business and deliver strong returns to our stockholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the quarter before returning for Q&A. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks Rick and good afternoon. Revenue for Q3 was above the mid-point of guidance at $738 million and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter at $0.84 driven by higher revenue and lower than modeled operating expenses in the period.","Fully diluted GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.81. The GAAP earnings per share in Q3 included $0.03 of acquisition, restructuring, severance and other related charges net of the income tax effect on these adjustments.","My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude these adjustments. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share can be found in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website prior to this earnings call.","Looking at the overall business environment, the landscape is similar to what we described back in January with shipments and revenue levels for KLA-Tencor expected to be generally balanced half over half in 2015 and what is now planned to be a year of modest growth for WFE.","There are assumptions in the forecast that could impact the timing of results but the overall view that calendar 2015 will be a solid but not spectacular year for KLA-Tencor and for the industry remains the same today.","New orders in Q3 were $692 million at the upper end of the range of guidance of $500 million to $700 million for the quarter. Foundry was 76% of new orders in Q3 and logic was 7%, memory bookings finished at 17% of new system orders in the period.","Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group, wafer inspection was approximately 39%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was approximately 22%, service was 26%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%.","Total shipments in Q3 were $715 million. Given current shipment backlog we expect shipment levels in the second half of calendar 2015 to be roughly equal to the levels in the first half.","In total, we ended the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total backlog comprised of $1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that have not shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Total backlog also includes $239 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been accepted by customers.","Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $738 million up 9% compared with Q2. Gross margin was 57% and in line with the guided range. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 58% in June driven by a more favorable mix of high end wafer inspection tools in the quarter.","Looking ahead, our gross margin performance should continue to reflect our differentiated business model which is fueled by 60% to 70% incremental gross margins.","Operating expenses were $218 million, down from $231 million in Q2 and below the guided range of $227 million to $229 million, a result of favorable variance and some discretionary budget in quarter and from our continuing focus on cost controls.","The global employee workforce reduction plan announced today and previous organizational alignment action are intended to optimize our global business operations to maintain our leading market position, free up resources to direct investment on our most important customer and product development initiative and appropriately aligned our organization and business processes to fit in involving industry and customer landscape.","We are currently modeling operating expenses for June quarter to be flat compared with March. At this time, we're enable to make a good faith determination of the cost estimates associated with the global employee workforce reduction plan and our June quarter GAAP EPS guidance does not consider the impact to these costs.","We plan to update GAAP guidance once we have determined the earnings impact of the proposed plan. Other income and expense was a net expense of $29 million in March, and we expect OAE to be a net expense in the June quarter of approximately $28 million.","The tax rate was 21.1% in Q3 and inline with the long term planning rate of 22%. Net income was $137 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share on a non-GAAP basis.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended Q3 at $2.3 billion, we repurchase 2.6 million shares of stock and paid a dividend of $82 million in period, and cash from operations was strong at $242 million in a quarter.","Lastly we ended Q3 with approximately $163 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I expect Q4 to end at approximately $160 million. In conclusion to reiterate our guidance for the June quarter is new orders are expected to be in range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenues expected in the range of $710 million to $790 million with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range $0.78 to $1.02 per share.","This concludes our prepared remarks for today. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point we'd like to open the call to questions. We once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. Stephanie, we're ready for your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You line is open.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was quickly, Bren, you mentioned that the second-half shipment should be similar to the kind of first half. What is your shipment guidance for June quarter? And I also had a follow-up after that.","Bren Higgins","Sure, Krish, the guidance for the June quarter, at the midpoint is up 12% to $800 million, so the guidance range is $760 million to $814 per shipment.","Krish Sankar","Got it, that is very helpful. And then a question for Rick as a follow-up. I am curious to know the thought process behind the 10% workforce reduction, because it looks like the industry spending is robust and you guys also said that you need to go in debt like six months ago. So why the reason for the cuts now that you are confident and seem to be doing it? Is this more a reaction to any kind of competitive situation, market share loss, or is it more looking at KLA specifically over the next 12 to 24 months?","Rick Wallace","Well it's actually looking at the industry over the next five years and thinking about how we should be structured and to provide answers to customer's challenges.","So two things, one, as we know that industry has gotten a lot simpler in terms of customer consolidation and we have the luxury of being able to forward a relatively expensive go-to-market strategy which we are streamlining in this.","The second one is our product divisions, we'd had number of product divisions and for while that made a lot of sense for most of company's history, but we think now that in \u2013 as what we're seeing now from our customers is really request for a solutions across products and our ability to do that means we streamline those product divisions, let's say, you end up with a fair amount of excess capacity in terms of management to support that.","And so we end up being streamlined in terms of our go-to-market but also our product development. So it's really reflection of what's going on in the industry and the result is we end up being in a position where we're going to have the reduction of some of the talent that\u2019s been in the company.","Krish Sankar","Thanks Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. A couple of things. Rick, I guess - this is just a big picture question, but I'm just looking at your WFE share. And in 2014 you lost about 50 bps of WFE share. And if the back half, revenue wise, is pretty similar to the front half of this year, you're going to lose another 50 bps roughly. And it seems like there is - that your lack of exposure to memory is becoming a real problem as a lot of the secular spending vectors are in memory.","So I guess I wanted your opinion on is this finally the straw that sort of breaks the camel's back that forces you to get into the process business to gain some exposure to memory? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks, Rick.","Rick Wallace","Sure, Tim. So, let me start with no, this is not something that force us into process. I think what it does is - we have opportunities to create more value in memory and to increase the capital intensity, but we don't necessarily - we haven't delivered those solutions yet to the market. And some of those memory processes are inherently less process control intensive and we know that. So there is some opportunity for growth there.","And we also as we model it out, we do think we are in a secular part of the, I guess, that the industry where memory is going to be higher, but not forever. And so when we model this we'd say, yes 2015 continues to be probably more memory heavy then if you go back three or four years, but we think that trend will swing particularly when we start seeing investment in next generation technologies as in the 10-nanometer node for logic and for process which have been delayed.","Then we'll expect to see foundry come into balance and we'll see opportunities to grow relative to the market. We think we hold to the market overall this year but we have chances for growth as we go forward. Bren, you want to add any color to that.","Bren Higgins","No, I think, Tim, within the segment itself, our market share position is very strong. And so we're comfortable with our positioning but obviously as you know memory isn't our strongest hand so every WFE dollars is not created equal in terms of the impact on our business.","So while we're - I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the share front memory and some of the opportunities to increase adoption, the adoption is not going to ever get to where foundry and logic is.","So we think that once foundry and logic begins to invest in earnest and some of the technology transition that Rick mentioned, we feel pretty good about our relative performance at that point.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, great. And then, a just quick follow-up to that, Bren you had guided, I have my notes, last call you said, that you saw orders in the first calendar half of this year would be about flat with the calendar second half of the last year, which is implying that orders in June would be like 825 something like that now even if I adjust for March being a bit better, being above the range, it seems like roughly $100 million pushed out of the first half of this year from the order perspective, can you talk about what that was?","Bren Higgins","So, once again the specific customer situations but I was expecting more for at least from an order perspective, more 10-nanometer activity to start to show itself from the June quarter and that looks like that's delaying now to the second half of the years. I'd see principally that's the biggest piece of the change.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Bill Peterson","Good afternoon this is Bill Peterson for Harlan. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Piggybacking on the move towards 10-nanometer, as you talked about, it's really limited to a few players at the moment, but as we look ahead, what is your view on capital intensity uplift for process control as we compare to, say, 14, 16, or 20, the combined node. And related, how should we think about the reuse of equipment when transitioning between these advanced nodes? Thanks for your insight on that.","Bren Higgins","Sure. The 10-nanometer process intensity we have some models for it but until it really happens, its going to be hard to validate those models because we're still early in terms of people's development for it. But we did have model that we laid out and we can talk to the specifics of that in a minute.","In terms of the transition and the reuse issue, I think that its pretty clear in cases like the 20 to 16-nanometer transition you do see the opportunity for customers to have fair amount of reuse depending on the back end of the process and how much change there.","So far that's part of it, but the other do they maintain the 20-nanometer line going and so reuse gets, I think you see more pronounced if the volume on the 20-nanometer decreases when they go to 16, does that make any sense. So 10 we think is entirely a different case more like the transition from 28 to 20 then it from 20 to 16 and so we expect more intensity as a result of that we're looking for some of that data and the specifics here inside.","Yes, so the way we laid it out, I don't think we feel, we feel very comfortable with the data at least on the foundry logic side that what we consider one exit in below which included 20-nanometer was in excess of 18% on logic foundry.","So to Rick's point, I think the biggest issue is very similar toolsets from 20 to 16, 14 with the same lithography, the biggest question was going to be the size of the node and the number of designs and therefore the ability to migrate capacity.","So to the point earlier with very little activity, 20-nanometer beyond couple of customers, customer were able to migrate capacity down to 16 and so, so I think that's the dynamic that we're seeing.","But we're comfortable with the 18% as Rick said early on 10 and so I think we'll save that for another day and depending on how you to that earlier question, depending on how you one day gets to this total, but with memory blended at 40% to 45% which is probably where it is this year. You're probably sub 14% -14.5% or so on that range between 14% and 15%, but we will see how it plays out through the year.","BillPeterson","Thanks for that color. My follow-up, and switching gears to memory, we are getting closer to 3D NAN adoption as we witnessed from a lot of the press releases out there. We would expect, of course, more [caption depth] [ph] intensity with reuse of a lithography. But can you give us an updated view on what your customers are standing to require from a process control perspective and how it compares to 15-, 16-nanometer Planar? I guess presumably areas like [indiscernible] OCD stress become more intensive but what about some other areas, inspection overlay and things like that? Thanks for the insight.","Bren Higgins","Sure. I would say it is more intensive in metrology than it is inspection when you look at the transition of 3D. There are couple of areas for opportunity and inspection, there's definitely opportunity when it comes to majoring, inspecting films and especially buying films and there's a big desire to keep those process as clean given the stat. So you do have opportunities there because angles are relaxed, you have less intensity associated with advanced wafer inspection expect for in the development phase, so you do see it there but not as much in production.","Metrology is kind of where the action is though, because there is so much in terms of number of players requirements, round overlay and film measurement, so we do see big opportunity in terms of what's going on in the metrology.","And so, in aggregate you do get an increase and the intensity, but it still is significantly what we see in the logic foundry. But the rate of increases similar to what we see in the rate increase in logic foundry, but the intensity is probably modeled, it was about half of that what you see in large foundry. So, we\u2019re matching subject to the shift for memory to logic or logic memory than we are necessary node to node, where we do see increased adoption associated with the advance node.","BillPeterson","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Weston Twigg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First just wanted to ask if you had a new investment program from your customers to move forward with actinic UV mass inspection, how quickly could you ramp that program up and does that potentially impact your workforce layoff plan?","Bren Higgins","I guess, we are having the lot of conversations with customers about that and nothing has really changed in terms of the customer sentiment around the need and timing of actinic inspection. So as soon as I think we see any capacity being available, should it get funded is 2019 and at this point we don't see a lot of appetite for that given the relative low adoption in terms of EUV and the production.","So what we do see here, we have some recent examples of some plans as you know to do, cut mask, but 6XX product line that we have there can service that and service those needs and it is going to be utilize to do that.","So the answer remains the same, its probably four to five years if we were to get funding we don't anticipate that happening any time soon and the talent that one would need to do that is not necessarily the talent that is - we\u2019re viewing as part of a transition to this linear structure as we go forward. And so from that standpoint it really has no bearing on actions that we are taking now.","Weston Twigg","Okay, that's helpful. And just secondly, Intel announced a large CapEx reduction this year from its forecast, largely based on equipment reuse as we migrate from 22- to 14-nanometer. That's a full node transition, so traditionally you wouldn't have had a lot of impact from equipment reuse and I'm wondering if that's a little different this time around? Are you seeing much reuse from that 22-nanometer node at Intel?","Rick Wallace","Not given the specific customers in terms of how that's moving, but I think if you look at the reduction in CapEx there and the reduction in CapEx from TSMC, we had about $2 billion of CapEx come out of the market. So about $1 billion of that was WFE and at the intensity levels we described earlier represents probably somewhere around - somewhere between $100 million and $150 million of KLA-Tencor opportunity given our share in the intensities I mentioned.","So, clearly those push-outs had an effect on our business as we look at the year. There is probably some opportunities for some upside out there, I think has happened around 10-nanometer or strengthening in some of the memory markets but recent terms however we see it today its hard to ignore that impact in terms of the - the impact on CapEx and the customer behavior we're seeing as a result of that.","On the reuse from 22 to 16, I think it's the same thing. I think in some way I think - the ability to extent certain tools, metrology requirements are different, so there is some there - customers always try to do that. I think at this note, I think its particularly a little bit more, there is more reuse but in general its always - they always attempt to use more and it really depends on how much of that process is changing through the front end, back end.","Weston Twigg","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Chelsea Jurman","Hi, this is Chelsea Jurman on behalf of Jim. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like you are now expecting WFE to be flat or up slightly and that this is going to be determined by the second half. Relative to where you provided your initial guidance for 2015, where are you seeing the most upside, and where is there the biggest risk to the downside?","Rick Wallace","That's the way we are seeing it right now and as I said I think upside is related to foundry logic 10-nanometer and Volume-NAND. I think that on downside there, I think is all publicly related to how much end market demand we actually see start to come into play around 16 to 14 and what does that do to drive more capacity I would say - absent the broader sort of macro issues that are out there that's how we would see it.","Chelsea Jurman","Got it. And then in terms of growing in line with the market in 2015 or in line with the industry, would you say that your forecast for industry growth has come down since the beginning of the year? And how is your growth impacted by the changing CapEx cuts at not only Intel but other big customers?","Rick Wallace","Yes I think we are inline with the rest of our peers around the views of the year and I think with the public announcements from two significant customers and our strongest space, or strongest segment that is certainly led us to moderate that view for the year.","Chelsea Jurman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to Wes' question for you, Rick, in terms of the mask inspection for EUV, how do you look at it from a KLA perspective in terms of the risk\/reward, the investments? Will you only do it if you're going to get some of outside funding or is there something you can do if the customer demand is there to take on that project?","Rick Wallace","No, this is one where we need to work closely with the customers to make sure that A, the demand is there and the commitment is there because right now the uncertainty around the timing of high volume EUV makes this a very different kind of question in terms of the investment profile.","Remember we build that tool and there is not a market for it, there is no other application for it. It can only be used for one thing which is to inspect EUV masks. And if you build advanced wafer inspection tool, it really only matters the people are making wafers and doesn\u2019t really matter the technology they are making it with.","So, for that reason we're coupled to our customers on this and talking closely with them about their needs and we'll develop in conjunction with them as we go forward. But to-date we have not seen compelling interest on their part to want to make that commitment.","Patrick Ho","Great; that's really helpful. And maybe, Bren, for you, in terms of some of the industry commentary you provided, particularly some of the pulls and pushes you're getting both on the FinFET 16-, 14-, and the 10-nanometers, do to see any pulls from your vantage point of -- or pushes and pulls from 14 to 16 being pushed out, but some customers trying to pull in 10 and accelerate that process? Is that something you could potentially see in the second half of the year in terms of additional 10-nanometer development in lieu of the capacity adds for 16 and 14.","Bren Higgins","I mean, I guess it's possible. What we've seen so far I think a continuation of what we've experience over the last couple of quarters and that's been a very measured pace of additional capacity adds for 14, 16. And so it's been a much more measured pace than we've seen in prior nodes and as a result on the margin we've had weaker sort of general results or order, orders and shipments.","And so, as we look at beyond - who knows what's going to happen? I think there is some high profile potential announcements in the second half of the year and does that drive competitive dynamics that drive incremental capacity as possible. We are certainly living in environment today where we don't get a lead time visibility from our customers because our customers aren't getting it from there.","So, I think we have the capacity to be flexible, the response to an uptick if it would happen. I mean, right now based on a commentary earlier and the way we're modeling is modest sort of up year for the industry and our performance in line with that.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thank you. Operator, read next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for take my question. My first question is regarding the OpEx that you announced. How should we think about the OpEx level, given that you're cutting your OpEx and should we think should be roughly about 10% cut from the OpEx level that you are currently at? And also how does the OpEx cut change your onshore versus offshore cash generation?","Rick Wallace","Good question. So, I think we'll have more to say about what are normalized targets are going to be as part of this, I mean part of action is really been driven by our strategic need in terms of how we're going to structure company, obviously it\u2019s a more efficient structure and they'll be savings, but some of the savings will be redirected into some other things that we want to invest more in. I mean one very strong aspect of this reorganization is it's allow us to very easily capital across different projects to capitalized on opportunities in a more effective and expeditious way if you well. So I think that's certainly something that we\u2019re looking at.","In terms of a model, the way I'm think about is we take the current business levels which roughly equate to about an annualize level of $3 billion with fully loaded variable comp we will generating operating margins of about 30% and with the ability to be able to scale the business on revenue growth at 50 to 60 incremental operating margin off of that base.","That's how we're modeling, but I think we're very early and we'll have more to say as we progress over the coming weeks towards SEMICON West.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. And then in terms of the programs where you think some investment could be needed, can you just highlight like maybe like one or two areas where you think like which are very good growth opportunities for inspection where you maybe increasing the OpEx?","Rick Wallace","Well, I'll take this. There is two areas really, one is around \u2013 these are areas we'd emphasize more and recognize that to Bren's point we're modifying how much we're spending but where we would emphasize and move, really around the two solutions we have one is around patterning solutions, which we look at the opportunities to bring together and we've already introduce 5D which is our solution to really trying to help our customer managed the challenges of complex patterning.","And so there's an elements of that that includes some of the design information as well as the overlay measurements of film thickness and stack and integrated that into complete solution that allows our customers to address the challenges they have.","So investing in that is one, the other one is in our defect portfolio and part of the reason for these changes is integrating again some of the data that we see in design along with the information we find during inspection with some of the information we have in review and what we call fusion program and in that we take that information and it helps our defect discovery for our customers and allows them to accelerate their ramps and identifying and hunting down some of the challenges they face.","So both of those are system solutions that our divisional structure didn\u2019t necessarily inhibit but it certainly will be facilitated in this new structure in those areas we are certainly going to focus on big demand from our customers for that and we\u2019re pretty excited about our ability to provide solutions there.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. That's all I have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, similar to Tim's question, if I look at your PDC market share, it has been pretty stable and actually going up, but the PDC share as a percent of equipment spending WFE has been coming down from 8% to 9% to 7%. Can you talk about your opportunities in the non-semi-markets, the storage packing? Is there anything you can do, either organically or inorganically to know there?","Rick Wallace","Sure. We certainly have, we participate in what\u2019s going on in some of the back end and packaging and so on. And we have opportunities for growth there but let me just caveat it by saying the size of that opportunity relative to the rest of the company doesn\u2019t provide a meaningful uplift to our overall.","But we think it\u2019s more important is associated with the intensity of process control and foundry and memory and a big part of that transition as we know is the increased memory spend.","We think that that comes back into balance, in the future we\u2019re not exactly sure when and we think that once again provides our opportunity to go faster in the industry. We do see increased intensity as we go node to node, some of that is opportunity that will capture with our existing products and some of it is opportunity that we\u2019re going to need new capability to capture and work minute above.","So we\u2019re not really looking outside of our core for to grow faster than the industry. We think we\u2019ve got what we need inside, we just need to execute.","Atif Malik","Great. And, Bren, at SEMICON Analyst Day last year you talked about returning 100% of accessible free cash flow to shareholders and then post this restructuring move, is that still the plan?","Bren Higgins","Yes I mean I think the extra element in that is how we think about de-levering the - some of the debt that we brought on and we structured a component that debt with a term loan bank component that we have prepay ability to. So using 100% of the cash flow obviously we\u2019ve got the ongoing dividend and that\u2019s a different exercise in terms of how we think about the growth rate in that ongoing dividend relative to the growth rate in free cash flow of the company.","And then the difference between the U.S. cash which is about 60% to 70% of the total less the ongoing dividend goes towards share repurchase and de-levering.","So we\u2019re committed to executing the share repurchase component of the recap announcement we made last fall and then beyond there I think my focus probably shifts more towards this beyond dilution more towards de-levering to my long-term leverage target at 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA.","Atif Malik","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Thank you very much. Just want to follow up on comment you guys made earlier that 20, 16, 14 node is not ramping as fast as you would have thought. And 20, it was supposed to be slow and I remember 28, when you ramped first, it was a huge year for you. You outperformed by 20% in that year, and we haven't seen that at 20, 16 and 14. So do you have some thoughts on what is happening in the marketplace with this particular node? If you consider this as a one-node, 20, 16, 14, and compare it to 28, why so much difference in these two nodes?","Bren Higgins","Well I think you mean the end market demand at 20-nanometer wasn\u2019t particularly strong beyond in couple of quarters and so customers have the ability to migrate some of that capacity, we\u2019ve seen that in the few areas to 14 16 given the similarities with part of the process. So I think having lumped them together is how we think about them and I think it\u2019s probably a combination of factors and market demand, competitive dynamics and so on that we\u2019re different and stronger perhaps 28-nanometer than what we\u2019ve seen so far at 20 and below.","That can change and change quickly but at least so far that\u2019s the pattern we\u2019ve seen and it\u2019s the pattern we\u2019ve seen over the last three quarters. So it\u2019s not necessarily something different in terms of couple of quarters. We think that that lot of that capacity begins to ship and then we will start to see how the rest play of it plays out here as we move through June and into the second half of the year.","Mahesh Sanganeria","And one more question on your commentary on first half similar to second half, can you talk a little bit about what do you see in terms of the distribution of spending in shipment terms between logic and memory in the first half over second half?","Bren Higgins","I don't know if I have that level of granularity, I know that that there just qualitatively fair amount of memory activity here in the June quarter that look at the data and then also some foundry shipments very strong quarter from Taiwan, you will see in some of the data in terms of bookings and I think that will turn quickly.","So foundry pretty strong as well through June. I think for the year as I said earlier, I think if you look at total order mix and modeling that memory is probably in the low 40 percentile of the total. And I think our shipment profile would reflect that.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chen with UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chen","Thanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just another follow-up question on the gross margin. Does any of this foundry 28-nanometer fill-in spend that you talked about have a negative mix impact on KLA's gross margin now and maybe that reverses itself the second half of the year or is this 28-nanometer fill-in expense just not that meaningful?","Bren Higgins","Our margins across all of our segments are generally very consistent and segments and customers. So there isn\u2019t really an impact if have one customer having versus another in the given quarter. Most of it\u2019s driven - most of the variations frankly are in gross margins driven more around product mix than anything else right high end wafer inspection versus low or radical for example mash up versus fab, those dynamics tend to influence our gross margin much more so than anything related to customer mix or segment.","Stephen Chen","And just a brief follow-up question on the capital intensity. The foundry customers have talked about moving quickly from this 2X technology node to the 1X technology node. Should this be any benefit to KLA at this year or has that played itself out already? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","While we\u2019ve certainly seen at least from some of the market leaders we\u2019ve seen some investments this quarter and in last quarter very, very strong quarter in the December quarter and those tools are now beginning to ship. There is some other backlog that we expect that we book in previous quarter also we expect to ship as we move into second half of the year. So I think a lot of it\u2019s going to be driven by end market demand that is dynamics among our customers and we want to see how that plays out.","Stephen Chen","Okay. Thanks Bren.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking the question. My first question would be are you planning to invest more into e-Beam inspection and into packaging related to tools?","Bren Higgins","I\u2019m sorry E-beam and packaging that was the question?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes E-beam inspection and packaging.","Bren Higgins","Okay. So separate, yes. What we have - we certainly we have interest in trying to provide a complete defect inspection solution and so there are certainly there are niches of that which are best served by E-beam and we participate in certainly E-beam review we have a product, we are proud of there, we have not been in the inspection market but we are certainly evaluating ways down there.","But we also believe that customers very much want high productivity solutions and the capability which are part of what our Fusion offering is aimed out as providing the capability of linking both optical inspection with the ability to quickly review those defects.","So we\u2019re participating, we don\u2019t have I don\u2019t see a huge increase in our E-beam inspection investment overall, we are investing pretty heavily in E-beam in general and we might move between some of the segments there.","As far as packaging, we do have some ongoing opportunity, we frankly don\u2019t see that big of a market for process control and packaging, we do participate in that but I would not anticipate increasing our investment toward packaging. I think the front end is much more interesting for us in terms of the opportunities that are out there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. And is there any particular product that could be more useful regarding automotive electronics, like micro-inspection that you might be invest in?","Bren Higgins","Well we have and we have had some success there again these are on a relative basis pretty small but we do have a product line that is a variance of some of our laser scanning product offerings that are used in the front end and this one is services the automotive and that is a product line called Altair where we have shared some success in automotive than we are seeing adoption across the number of customers.","But again relatively small ASP and pretty hard to see in our overall numbers but we certainly participate there.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is open.","Edwin Mok","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First is a follow-up question on gross margin. It was down a few points early in the quarter. I know you guys guided for that already, but I was wondering what contribute to that? And I think previously you guys said you expect a year to fall within the range of 57%, 58% range? Is that how we should think about maybe a longer-term gross margin or nominal gross margin for your business?","Rick Wallace","Yes I think as I have to think about at these business levels, so 57% to 58% three-ish billion range is where I think we are going to end up. We had a very rich margin in the December quarter and very much an alignment with guidance for the March quarter. We think that we got some slight mix improvements as I look at June with very modest revenue increase.","That's why we had to think about it and then over time I think you are to think dollar continue as I said in the prepared remarks to move it 60% to 70% incremental. One of the things we\u2019re seeing as a service business grows it does put some pressure on margin but that\u2019s contemplated in that incremental margin range.","But we\u2019ve have got that dynamic that goes on as well. So certainly in certain revenue levels, the impact of service margin can be higher than others. But that's how I have to think about it.","Edwin Mok","Okay, great, that's helpful. I guess a longer-term question on mask inspection, right? With the mask, the photomask industry is not consolidated already, and there is capacity out there, right? Do you see that market normalizing in the lower level and stabilize here? Especially with UV out there somewhere, is it possible that these company prefer not to invest in mask inspection or mask capacity in general?","Rick Wallace","Well I think that the challenge is the of multi-patterning actually put some interesting stresses on the mask because as we go below the 16 or 14-nanometer what we are seeing is increasingly complex mask which are driving a lot of requirements for our 6XX product line.","The good news is, we don\u2019t think that's a tremendously expensive investment required, it's off mostly algorithms and some modifications for the tool. So unlike going to new platform, we think that the investment required will be significant but not a significant if you had to do new platform.","But as long as multi-patterning progresses, we do see stress on the mask and we think that's opportunity for the mask business and albeit at perhaps at a slightly lower revenue level but profitability should be good because we can continue to invest but at a lower rate than if we are doing a new platform.","So we feel pretty good about that. We do have some tailwinds there because we can provide some capability for the EUV with that product line but that's already something that we've developed, there might be extensions to that.","But we think there is good opportunity, I don\u2019t think the mask business goes away at all, I think it probably has seen some of the tougher periods it\u2019s going to go through and we think it probably stabilizes from here as we go forward.","Edwin Mok","Great, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Shawn Lockman","Hi, good evening, this is Shawn Lockman on for Rubin. I was wanting to jump back to some comments you made in your prepared comments about scaling back investment in EUV as part of the workforce reduction. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your thinking there, and when you may reach a point again where that investment has to return, if that comes closer to 7 nanometer or prior to that and timelines around that.","Bren Higgins","Well we have for quite a while been very public that we are not going to continue to go forward on EUV reticle inspection without significant customer support because there is a limited set of customers.","So while we will continue to do feasibility and some of the work there, we\u2019re backing off some of the other work until we have that commitment from customers which isn't out there right now.","So it's really not a question we can answer because it's an ongoing dialog with customers but I think there is only one of two answers that really make sense one is that, collectively the industry feels like we\u2019re able to go ahead without actinic inspection for EUV and high production which I think is early to know that. And the way you go ahead is you leverage the 6XX platform and some other solutions to validate the reticles, that's one alternative.","Another alternative is that there isn\u2019t any high volume EUV production and we\u2019re certainly as an industry a long way from knowing the answer to that and hopefully there will be in everyone's best interest.","And then the last one is that the industry comes back and says that they are committed to actinic tool and we\u2019ll work with them to develop it. But right now we\u2019re backing off independent investment until we get that signal, we will continue to do IP work, we will continue do some work on source but we\u2019re going to - we have been reducing that and that's part of this transition.","Shawn Lockman","Great, that extra color is helpful. I was wondering also if you could talk about any customer activity you are seeing in China right now? A lot of chatter around buildout there in terms of the industry. Just wondering if you could shed some light on any sort of activity you're seeing there and then also what you might expect for that market in the next two to three years?","Bren Higgins","Well in terms of current activity we did see some business out of China from one of our major customers there, its business that we have been tracking for some time and I think it\u2019s been related to second source opportunities by some fabulous players. And so it\u2019s encouraging to see that investment actually play out over the last quarter and in last couple of quarters.","We\u2019re not modeling any fundamental shift in over the longer run spend in China or growth beyond what we have normally seen and something consistent with the market at least at this point. I don\u2019t know enough about what will happen, won't know what technology all those kinds of questions to put a \u2013 in a timeframe that makes any sense to put to try to quantify it in anyway.","But we continue to see we had a very good quarter there, we continue to see business there for non-TSMC foundry.","Shawn Lockman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho","Thanks for taking my question. Your backlog actually has a pretty healthy level. I think it was about 1 to $1.1 billion a couple of years ago and now sitting around $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of the backlog by end market and how confident are you that these products will be shipped, let's say, this year? And follow-on to that, are you seeing any cancellation that is more than normal? And can some of these tools in your backlog actually be used for next year rather than this year? Trying to gauge the health of the backlog in orders.","Bren Higgins","Yes. So the backlog, the majority of the backlog will ship over the next six months and just about all of it is planned to ship over the next six to nine months or so.","So it is a little bit higher now. We've booked some business and there has been some delays on certain fab projects and so that has made the backlog go little bit bigger than what we saw let\u2019s say a year ago. If we go back way ago, if you go back a few years you would see our backlog, shipment backlog is usually six to seven months.","Right now it\u2019s about five months, and so it is probably bigger than it was in the last year where it was four to five. So we expect that as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect that to ship, I don\u2019t have the details on the composition, but the composition ever reflects the composition of our orders.","The tools are in backlog for anywhere from three to five months and then they ship out in revenue within about six months or so from the time we take the order overall. So I think that it matches the order percentages that we give every quarter.","Sidney Ho","Okay. As a follow-up, I know this -- the CapEx got by two of your major customers have been asked a few times and I think the reuse of tools are pretty well understood at this current generation. But they also both talk about better capital efficiencies, just better use and whatnot. I think this is unique for the first generation of FinFET, but does that change if you were to -- this WFE will eventually reach what everyone has been thinking, like $37 billion at some point?","Bren Higgins","I'm probably not the best guy to ask about when the industry is at 37 or we see run up to there I mean the way we model is the capital intensity is probably not declining much anymore, its probably flat, its probably not increasing. And so the underlying semiconductor revenue growth rate of 4% to 5% which means CapEx and wafer fab equipment on a growth generally inline with that over time.","And so as we run our business, we see similar growth rates on the system side, our service business is growing faster than that and that's how we think about modeling the company.","Where the peak is, is always hard to say, usually peaks are followed by troughs but in terms of through cycle view that's how we think about it.","Sidney Ho","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Thank you very much. So I had a question on the restructuring. I know it's early and you are still working through it. Can you give a sense of where is the majority of the cut will be, in sales or G&A or R&D or is it more even?","Rick Wallace","Yes. We are not really in a position to quantify that now. As Bren said, and we said in our prepared remarks over the next several weeks as we work through those details, we are going to make that public as soon as we finalize those. But we are not ready at this time to disclose that.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. Then one quick question on the actinic inspection. I think you made some reference to cut mask. If you reuse just for cut mask, do you think it's much easier to do the cut mask without actinic inspection as opposed to the other steps?","Bren Higgins","I think that there are options, if it's cut mask and development that leverage the existing infrastructure. If it's only a couple of layers which is the way we\u2019re understanding it now. And I think using the 6XX to support that work for development.","High volumes are different question but for development I think we are certainly in a position to be able to help customers do that. And yes, the technical challenge is associated with the cut mask are going to be easier.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Okay operator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for all joining and we look forward to seeing you later on in the quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"12444":["KLA-Tencor Corp.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to KLA-Tencor's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Connor. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2015. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy.","A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement our earnings call including a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports.","In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements including those that we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of the quarter and our view of the demand environment in the second half of calendar year 2015, and provide guidance for the September quarter. Then Bren will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials.","KLA-Tencor executed well in Q4, delivering bookings and revenue just above the midpoint of guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share at the upper end of the guided range, reflecting our market leadership, strong gross margin performance, and focused cost discipline. New orders for June were in line with our expectations at $672 million, driven by stronger than expected demand from memory customers focused on 3D NAND capacity expansion which was offset by weaker logic and foundry orders in the quarter. Looking ahead to the overall industry demand environment for the second half of calendar 2015, memory investments focused primarily on 3D NAND capacity additions and is expected to increase and broaden out among the market leaders in the second half of the year.","Capacity investment in DRAM is expected to moderate in the second half of the year, with customers focused on technology conversions and process migration. In foundry and logic, investment in the second half of the year is expected to be focused on FinFET capacity additions by the market leaders as well as incremental new capacity expansion for 28-nanometer foundry. However, uncertainty over the timing and magnitude of leading-edge capacity ramps for two major foundries continues to create headwinds for foundry CapEx and the remainder of calendar year 2015.","With the recently announced reduction in logic CapEx budget for 2015, leading-edge logic investment is seen to remain at low level for the rest of the year. Our current expectation is for KLA-Tencor to begin shipping process control equipment for 10-nanometer development in the first half of calendar year 2016. For KLA-Tencor, our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. The focus of our strategy is on a long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7% per year, driven by leading technologies and differentiated solutions, and fueled by a high level of R&D investment in one of the industry's leading business models.","At SEMICON West this year, we discussed some of the structural changes we have implemented in our global organization to streamline our go-to-market strategies, and focus product development efforts on the best opportunities in pursuit of these strategies. We expect these actions to begin to produce results over the next few quarters. And we plan to receive initial orders for our latest generation flagship optical inspection platform and see the benefit of our recent OpEx reductions reflected in our earnings in the second half of fiscal year 2016.","Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $450 million to $650 million. Guidance for revenue in the September quarter is in the range of $595 million to $655 million and non-GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.66 in the quarter. With our current backlog and the anticipated order profile for the second half of the year, we expect bookings shipment and revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his review of the numbers.","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q4, my perspective on current trends in the marketplace, and our outlook for the second half of calendar year 2015.","Revenue for Q4 was $756 million above the midpoint of guidance and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter at the top end of the guided range in $0.99 per share. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the difference in EPS of $0.10. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in today's press release.","Turning now to customer segment commentary for the June quarter. New orders in Q4 were $672 million, also above the midpoint of the guided bookings range for the quarter of $550 million to $750 million as we saw strength in NAND flash orders in the period.","Memory was 62% of new system orders in June, up strongly on a sequential basis both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared with the March quarter. Memory demand in the June quarter featured strong NAND flash demand with orders from multiple customers supporting 3D NAND expansion projects highlighting the results. Foundry demand was 33% of new orders for Q4 and moderately below our expectations for the quarter. Logic was 5% of new orders in June, down sequentially and down compared with our original forecast.","Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group. This breakdown by product group now reflects the new organization structure we introduced two weeks ago at SEMICON West. For the purpose of comparison, the wafer inspection group is largely comparable to the order breakdown previously categorized under the same name and the patterning group now includes both the former metrology and reticle inspection categories.","In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, wafer inspection was approximately 47%, patterning was approximately 24%, service was 27%, and non-semi was 2%. Total shipments in Q4 were $739 million and below the guided range, principally due to a delay in buyout timing of a high ASP leading-edge mask inspection system, changing customer requirements for sub-20-nanometer shipments to a foundry customer that occurred late in Q4, and an accident in a customer fab that led to shipment delays into the September quarter.","Although current shipment backlog is strong at $984 million, the scheduled backlog is concentrated among a few customers who have recently been adjusting their scheduled delivery dates, impacting our visibility on a quarter-to-quarter basis and leading to shipment delays of tools originally expected to ship in the June and September quarters to later in our fiscal year. In total, we ended Q4 with over $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $984 million of shipment backlog, orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the six months to nine months, and $221 million of revenue backlog for products that have shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments in the range of $610 million to $690 million.","Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $756 million, up 2% sequentially compared with the March quarter and above the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $655 million in the September quarter, driven by the lower shipments forecast resulting from certain customer shipment delays and timing of customer product acceptances required for certain tools in the quarter. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point improvement compared with the March quarter, benefiting from a more favorable product mix and service mix than originally modeled. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in September, largely a function of the lower expected revenue levels for the quarter but in the range of our targeted 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model.","Total operating expenses were $214 million, down $4 million compared with the March quarter and down approximately $17 million on a year-over-year basis compared with the June 2014 level. Operating margin in the June quarter was 30.2%. The lower operating expense levels in Q4 reflected some of the benefit of the actions we have taken to adjust our global operations to match a consolidated customer environment, and to focus our R&D investments on our best opportunities, while maintaining our incremental operating margin model of 50% to 60%.","As Rick mentioned, our long-term objective is to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% per year through cycle over the long-term with a focus on market leadership, strengthening our position in our core markets, and continuing to drive opportunities for growth in our service business. Accompanying that goal is the objective to grow operating income at twice the rate of revenue growth over time. Results of the June quarter demonstrate good cost discipline and strong execution towards our long-term profitability growth objective. Accordingly, we are currently forecasting a $2 million sequential decline in quarterly operating expense to the $212 million level in the September quarter. This would represent a $28 million reduction in operating expenses compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 at similar revenue levels.","Our effective tax rate was 21% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate of 22%. In fiscal year 2016, you should continue to use 22% as a long-term planning rate for KLA-Tencor. The planning rate does not include any benefit from the R&D tax credit in the United States. In the event that this tax credit is extended, we'll modify our planning rate assumption. Finally, net income for the June quarter was $159 million or $0.99 per fully diluted share and we ended the quarter just under 160 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, an increase of $47 million compared with March. Cash from operations was $317 million in the quarter, up $75 million sequentially over the March quarter and free cash flow was $308 million. In the quarter, we paid $80 million in dividends and repurchased $168 million of shares of our common stock in the period. We also made a supplemental payment beyond the required loan amortization of approximately $20 million towards our outstanding term loans in Q4.","Additionally in July, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share, the seventh increase in our regular dividend since it was first instituted in 2005. We believe this reflects the board and management's confidence in our long-term growth strategies and target business model and is consistent with our ongoing focus of returning value and rewarding our long-term stockholders for their commitment to KLA-Tencor.","With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the September quarter is bookings are expected to be within a range of $450 million to $650 million but our current view that the second half of calendar year 2015 is roughly flat with the first half, shipments of $610 million to $690 million, revenue between $595 million and $655 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.66 per share.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to questions. We do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permit.","So, Connor, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. I guess first thing, Bren, just to clarify something you just said. You said calendar second half flat with calendar first half. You mean shipments, is that right? So that would imply that shipments in December are like $800 million?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I meant orders, Tim.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Orders? Okay.","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The order profile for the second half of the year is in line with the first half of the year. Obviously, we're seeing the seasonal effects in September with strengthening.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Then I guess just a big picture question for Rick. So I'm just looking back at, if I strip out the service number, if I just assume that service grows a bit and I look at just your systems revenue for September, it's as low as it's really ever been since the 2009 downturn. Nobody else is really anywhere close to that. So I guess from a strategic point of view, obviously, right now, you guys aren't super exposed to some of the 3D NAND things that are happening.","And whenever in the past we've talked about maybe getting exposure to that area, maybe via partnership with a films company, at the time the argument was that you wanted to remain independent process neutral third-party. But does that logic hold anymore? Do you think that now given some of the changes in device architecture that maybe it does makes sense for a process control company to work together or merge or combine with a films company? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think there's definitely benefit in working closely with process equipment providers in terms of helping create products and processes and solutions that support some of the challenges customers face. But it's actually a pretty broad spectrum. I think that, as a company, we actually do partner with a number of players both in etch and dep, and have found ways to create value. I think that's very different than putting two companies together and so we still don't see the value or the strategic \u2013 the way you get the investment back if you were to pursue that path. So the M&A front hasn't changed but definitely there is interest in people using metrology and inspection to leverage their process equipment.","And to your point, this is a very soft spot for us given the foundry and logic exposure we have and the fact that there's just not a lot of investment going on with those customers right now. We do anticipate that that will come back when we get into the 10-nanometer ramp which we think happens in calendar 2016 but certainly right now it's a soft spot for us.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about second half orders equivalent to first half orders. Last call, you articulated a view of shipments and revenue second half being relatively balanced. Based on your commentary today, it seems like second half is going be lower now even with December quarter inflection. So I guess first question is, is that a fair statement? And it sounds like most of this is foundry push-outs. So if you could just help us, is this more 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer FinFET push-outs or is it more the legacy 28-nanometer technology?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren. Your assessment is correct. From an order perspective, we think it lines up fairly consistent with what we had seen last quarter. But certainly, shipments and revenue, we did have some sizable shipments that pushed out of the revenue forecast in the second half of the year for sub-20-nanometer foundry activity that is the largely responsible for the reduced outlook in terms of our views on shipments and revenue into the second half of the year.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then your one large logic customer pushed out the timing of their 10-nanometer high volume production ramp by about a year. On the flipside, though, it does seem like the other two major foundry suppliers are still aggressively going to try and rollout 10-nanometer next year. How has this sort of changed your view on 2016, and the 10-nanometer contribution to the business? You mentioned 10-nanometer development tools shipping in the first half. Is this going to be more foundry or logic biased?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's a little early to call 2016 at this point. I mean, clearly, our view is, is that we'll see the 10-nanometer ramp again in the first half of the 2016, so you'll start to see activity there. Order timing is always a question in when you'd see those orders. On the logic side, we tend to get a little bit more lead-time than we do on the foundry. So in terms of how we're looking at how the shipments roll out, I think the shipments roll out largely consistent across both segments but it's a little bit early at this point. But I don't think our view is \u2013 we talked a lot about it at SEMICON a couple weeks ago, I don't think our views around 10-nanometer interest and timing have changed all that much.","It's just that's hard for me to see how you see any of that activity begin in this calendar year from a \u2013 you might start to see some orders at the tail end but certainly don't expect to see any shipments in 2015 for that.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them. First one, did you guys say that you expect some of your gen five optical inspection orders in the second half or is it more tied to 10-nanometer?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Krish, it's Bren. I don't know if it's tied exactly to 10-nanometer. It's really tied to the timing of those introductions. Typically, new products create their own weather in terms of timing of interest by customers. We would expect to see orders in the \u2013 toward the end of our fiscal year. And perhaps we'll see some revenue, too, towards the tail end. I don't think you fully see full scale sort of ramp and adoption until you move into the second half of 2016 but we should see some activity in the first half.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Krish, as you know, with a new product it's often the case that that is shipped and it's under contingency provision that when it achieves the milestones that you both recognize the revenue and the bookings. So less likely to see the bookings in the first half of the fiscal year because of that.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And then a follow up for Bren. If I took at your June quarter, over the last six months your OpEx is down 7% from December. I mean you guys have done a 10% head count. The June quarter numbers look similar to your target model. So is it fair to assume that you already started seeing the benefits of the restructuring or is there still more room to cut cost here?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's fair to assume we're starting to see some of it. Part of our assessment of where we were on a normalized basis, we were trending before we started the actions. And when I say normalized, I mean in terms of how you think about variable compensation adjustments and so on, somewhere around $225 million a quarter. And we see that trending down in terms of a fully loaded operating level of about $205 million to $210 million and we should see that progression across the fiscal year from here. So I think there's still room from where we're at now as we start to see those \u2013 some of those costs come off the books over the next quarter or so. And then we expect it to stay in that ballpark with some of the other actions that we have planned and are in process of executing.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And apologies for the voice. Curious your thoughts on 10-nanometer. We heard from one of your competitors talking about capacity being brought online in 2016 through 2018. And roughly 150,000 wafer starts versus, call it, 250,000 at 16, 14, 20, and 300,000 wafer 28. And would love to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes in terms of rising intensity but elongation of the node and smaller amount of wafer starts and what that means for annualized spend at the next node.","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, C.J., we haven't done the work on how we're looking at 10-nanometer starts. I mean, clearly, what we've seen so far in the sub-20-nanometer is not a lot of end-market movement towards 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, which obviously impacts that start level. So depending on the level of adoption that you do see obviously will impact what customers are able to do as they move to 10-nanometer. But so far at 20-nanometer outside of a couple high volume products, haven't seen a lot of activity which has enabled customers to use some of those tools at 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer. So a lot of it, I think, depends on not only the end-market activity but also the competitive dynamics at that node that drives ultimately the overall size of it.","So we think 10-nanometer will be a bigger node, given that it's \u2013 you have a full shrink to that node and that the ability to reuse tools if \u2013 is not the same as it was at 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer given that you had effectively the same back end process is at 20-nanometer down to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer. So we're optimistic about 10-nanometer both from a competitive dynamic front but also from an end-market front at this point.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, just to add a little color. The one thing we have seen is more starts in our work with the mask shops, we've seen more 10-nanometer designs than we might have thought at this time. And it does appear to be true that the fabless guys view 10-nanometer, kind of to Bren's point, because it's more of a shrink, it's actually being more of a real node and more advantageous to go to. And I think that that was part of what happened to 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer. So we see that. The negative of course is people have not yet really determined how difficult it's going be in terms of the ability to get yield and the impact that will have on all the cost per wafer. So I think you might see cost per transistor come down if people can figure out the yield challenges.","But the negative to that is we saw an earlier player push it out and partly due to some of those challenges. So we think there's going to be interest in getting designs going and hence a bigger node but the timing is harder to predict. And we know there's been push lately.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","That's very helpful. And as a quick follow up, I guess, a short term question, given the lower utilization at many foundries, how do you think about your service revenue trajectory into the back half of the year?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, C.J., that tends to be pretty linear. I don't expect to see an acceleration there. I expect to see it continue along the trajectory that we've seen, somewhere between 6% and 8% per year and growing quarter-on-quarter generally.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, part of what's happening of course, as you know is some of the fabs being extended longer that aren't at the leading edge. So if you look at the contribution that the service business from the very leading-edge and even some places where the utilization is slightly lower, it's actually to Bren's point, it responds slower. So we're seeing pretty good signs out of our service and our interactions with customers. Plus, we've identified a number of places where we can do upgrades and give more productivity to those customers to give us some upward pressure on the growth rate.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. If you look at gross margin relative to your competitors, your margins are about 10 to 15 points higher. And your competitors are saying, while true, their revenue growth is better. So sort of implying that there's a direct relationship between margins and top line growth. And I'm curious what your take is. Do you feel that gross margins at these levels are holding back the revenue growth to a certain extent?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's a great question and one that we've reviewed over time. I think the challenge is it doesn't appear to be the case that demand for process control is elastic. So if you were to offer \u2013 if you were to reduce prices, there's no evidence to support that there'd be more business there. I think people find the level they want to be at in terms of investing to get their process to ramp and to keep it under control. And they're going to pay for that with based on the returns they get. Whereas in a process situation, if I'm getting designed in at a node and the customer has a very strong view of how many they're going buy, they're in a very good position to negotiate that price over the life of that particular node.","And I think that's why you don't see the expansion, margin expansion for process equipments near the same way that we have it. And it's harder for them to get that beneficial pricing. With us, it's really a question of, if you need it. And if you don't need it, you're not going to buy it. And if you do need it, it's going to be a value exchange and that's where we see the strength in our business model.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Rick, on that point, you have talked about market share which you ceded a couple points last year. And I know the expectation internally is that you'd like to grow share. So does margins and pricing play a role in improving your share in process control at the time?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It hasn't historically. And the reason I say that is we've never been tool for tool low cost and competed on price. What we have to do is differentiate on performance and if the performance is there, we can typically, we can have higher productivity than the alternative but since we don't really make the same tools, when we look at our tool compared with our competitors, they're not the same tools. They are different approaches, different technologies. The most extreme example would be gen five against the e-beam alternative that's out there. So if we can demonstrate capability and higher productivity, it's again not a function of price. So what we're not going to do is chase the markets where it's based on a pricing decision because that's not consistent with our model. So this is why we invest heavily in R&D to have that differentiation. So two things we say. One, you got to have differentiation and the differentiation has to matter to the customers in a way that they see benefit in buying it and we think there are those opportunities for us.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Rick, I want to go back to the 10-nanometer commentary. There seems to be some confusion out there as to how the die size, not so much of the cost per transistor is going to change. Based on the tape-outs you've seen, do you have any color, anything you can share with us as how the die size is going be impacted by adverse impact of multi-patterning? And I'm referring to over-provisioning that limits the die size shrink? And is there a factor that is going to somewhat reduce the scaling that we're all hoping to have in the 10-nanometer? And I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've seen a range. As you know, when you think about advanced design roles for logic or for the foundry market, often one of the biggest drivers for those tends to be, it has been historically FPGAs, which tend to utilize large die. And I think that for those they're still going to be pushing performance and wanting scaling but there are a number of other chips of course that are going to drive various ranges of die size. So we've not heard that. I think it's an astute insight but we have not heard that as being a limiter for the 10-nanometer rollout as we've seen these increased number of designs. But to your point, it's also pretty early. So we haven't. I think it's still early days.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","And this is my follow up question. The reason I ask is, when we migrated from 28 to 20-, there was some yield challenges and despite lower wafer start, you were actually able to do relatively okay. And it was much better environment than converting, than migrating to sub-20. And now that we're a year or so away from 10-nanometer, is it true shrink? And I'm just wondering if some of the opportunities would go away? Is this something that we're going to learn more about the impact of die size at 10-nanometer? Are we going to learn that when wafers come out of the pilot line in the spring timeframe? Or are you going to be able to provide some color by October timeframe?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know how much color we'll have by October but I can give you my take on the last migration. I think a lot of what happened was, as we know now, looking back, 20-nanometer, we did do reasonably well going to 20-nanometer but it didn't carry over to 16-nanometer because as we went to 16-nanometer, of course we were left with reuse. I think the challenge in 10-nanometer is for customers it is a full shrink so they're going be challenged by that. But then as we think about 7-nanometer, the question is, are they going to have reuse opportunities there? And so part of the way we plan on addressing that is with new products. And I think the new products will give us this catalyst for driving new capability and creating more of an opportunity for us to grow.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Rick, a question on your December outlook. You're looking for a pretty substantial increase in order in December. Can you give us a little bit of color on what's driving that? Is it order for the new product you're looking at or is there segment specifically that's driving the order growth because we kind of know that 10-nanometer is a little bit far out.","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mahesh, it's Bren. So in terms of how we're sizing, I mean I'm not really guiding the December quarter as I said. It looks roughly flat in terms of half to half, so strengthening into December. We think obviously memory continues to be solid but we do expect to see some foundry activity start to pick up in the December quarter as well. There's some timing of some trailing edge projects that are out there that looks like we might see some of that activity start to book in the December timeframe. So, a combination of things across a couple of segments that gives us confidence around December being a solid increase versus September at this time.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then a follow up on that, the \u2013 usually you have a much longer lead-time but it has been shrinking for a while. If you see order pickup in December, I would say the \u2013 is the shipment pickup \u2013 significant shipment pickup happens in March or is it something that can happen in December?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It tends to be customer-specific. So harder to say at this point. I'm not sure I can guide the second half shipment profile right now.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is open.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess, follow up question on the memory order, very strong this quarter and you guys attributed that to 3D NAND. But I understand some of your customers might be looking to convert planar NAND fab to 3D NAND rather than doing greenfield. To the extent that they do that, is that a lot of reuse can happen and would that kind of limit your opportunity on the NAND side?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In the quarter, we had \u2013 3D NAND was solid. Also we had some DRAM activity that was good as well. I think you're going to see some conversions but most of the activity that we're seeing so far is more greenfield focused.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It also has more variation. I mean 3D NAND inherently doesn't necessarily have a lot more process control intensity but the decision by our customers to upgrade or try to reuse often depends more on the age of the fleet and what's out there and when they did their last process control buys. So memory was pretty soft for a while so there'd become more opportunities and when they're spending we're on the list of opportunities that they're looking at. So it's not quite as simple as their reuse because in those cases, the memory guys have invested at a lower level historically than we saw in foundry.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. That was good color. And then my follow up question is on 10-nanometer. Our understanding is that there's a change \u2013 and obviously when you go to 10-nanometer we have more multi-patterning steps and I understand there's a pretty big step-up in the number of patterning steps. How are you guys capitalizing on that opportunity with this new organization focusing on patterning?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I think that part of what customers are looking at as they look ahead is the metrology challenges both the \u2013 and really starting with the definition of the patterns with mask, and the interactions that you see on multi-patterning, how much the pressure there is on the overlay budget and film controls budget is they're really looking for the ability to synthesize and integrate the different tools in the portfolio. We're now organizationally set up in a much better way to support that because it's really aligning with our customers and many of our customers you'll find someone who is the exact counterpart to the new organizations that we've set up.","So we're in a better position to support that as opposed to them having to deal with three or four different representatives from different divisions. So the customer response to our reorg has been just flat out either very good or really good. Because I think, from their standpoint, it's just better. It's easier for them to deal with. So I think that gives us opportunity. And then of course we have the products in place but we're pretty well aligned with the 10-nanometer challenges. And there is a huge push for increase overlay control as they go down to 10-nanometer and the fear of what that is going to look like in terms of some of the errors induced starting with how the mask look.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. That's good color. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Redstone Research. Your line is open.","Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research","Yeah, thanks so much for taking my question, Rick. It's two questions. First, I just wanted to understand ASML has been pushing its EUV to its logic customers and several customers, just wanted to understand what is the status of the EUV mask inspection as ASML plans to ship several tools over the next 18 months to a major logic customer. I know you had kind of scaled back a little bit on the EUV. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we think we have a pretty compelling answer to reticle verification for EUV but it doesn't require an EUV reticle tool. It requires the 6xx platform that we have and our ability to do print check on devices once they're printed. And so, from our perspective, that is the answer to support the customers as they go through and the degree with which they adopt EUV. We're already supporting that in terms of the work that's going on in the reticle tool. And then we can support it when they printed on the actual wafer, so that is our answer.","Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research","Okay. Thank you. And just a follow up, I just wanted to understand fundamentally if you look at all the patterning opportunities that your competitors, like, Lam and Applied have laid out in terms of their growth in the patterning step, you would imagine that etch and deposition which are intensive for several of these applications would definitely need process control. Just wanted to get your thoughts into why the process control market hasn't really grown as one would have imagined? Is there anything that we are missing something like that? I'd appreciate your input on that.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think it's much more a function right now of the mix between memory and what we're seeing in terms of customers investing in memory versus investing in logic. In logic and foundry, our intensities are pretty good. It's just those customers are in a bit of an air pocket right now for us whereas the most of the investment has been along memory where there's also multi-patterning opportunities but that's \u2013 when you breakdown our process control intensities by different technologies, whether it's memory, logic, or foundry, that shift to higher percentage of memory is really explains the shift in our demand environment.","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing on foundry, logic intensity changes node to node. I think the biggest issue right now is, is that you are dealing with very similar tool sets at 20-nanometer and below and so the ability to migrate the capacity that was acquired for 20-nanometer down to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer with no backfill of design tape-outs where that capacity has enabled customers to reuse some of that equipment. But in terms of the intensity that we've seen on those purchases, it is in line with what we were expecting to see at 1x.","Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Yes. Sorry about that. Rick, kind of a bigger question in terms of multiple patterning and traditionally where you get process control intensity. Do you ever see more and more double, multiple patterning steps that should drive increasing I guess process control intensity that you've seen the foundry, logic space? I guess why hasn't the DRAM space or the memory guys adopted more process control, I guess in line with that transition?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, so there's two things if you think about process control. One is around the metrology space and the other one is around the defectivity space. And if you remember our SEMICON West presentation, we talked about in patterning, our market share's probably in the 40% range. So the capital intensity is higher in patterning and our share is not particularly strong and it hasn't actually gone up that much in memory for process control intensity. The other side though is defectivity, and defectivity for multi-patterning doesn't really depend so much on multi-patterning as much as it does on the device type. So you're making memory. These guys are almost at 100% repair when it comes to DRAM. And so you're not going to see as much and we haven't for many, many years see the adoption as high in DRAM.","And then 3D is a different decision because, for them, because there they really want 3D capability to look through the stacks and that technology just doesn't exist. So it's more a function of the process control intensity on defectivity and our market share in terms of the patterning and the relatively lower level of intensity and patterning as well in terms of what we see in memory. So really those combination of factors. Does that make sense?","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No, that's actually really helpful. And maybe again a bigger picture question for you. There's been a lot of chatter and one of your largest customers talked about Moore's Law cadence being kind of pushed out. From your perspective, maybe both for KLA specific and process control, how does that change where they've talked about 2 to 2.5 years potentially impact you guys?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're pretty dependent on node transition. So obviously if that pushes out, then we end up in a soft spot like we're in right now. Really the question is when, for us, the real question coming up is the 10-nanometer adoption because our belief is we're going to be in a relatively softer position for the next quarter and then we'll start seeing some improvement in the December timeframe. But what we're going to have to depend on is the 10-nanometer is going to happen in calendar 2016. Then the question is how much of a stretch is it from 10 to 7 and what's beyond that. It's pretty hard to say at this point.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand a little bit of the shipment profile of the 3D NAND orders that you received in the June quarter. Is it pretty much timed in September quarter or is it going to be spread out over next few quarters?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think around that segment most of those orders will ship in the next, over the course of September and into December. So lead times being three to six months on those tools.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then one high level question, like if we just look at like the yield problems that are going on, in whatever segment we look at there are yield challenges that are kind of slowing down the ramp plans, like we hear about DRAM 20-nanometer being like an issue for a lot of customers. And 3D NAND obviously is having issues and in foundry, since it doesn't seem like yields are progressing as well as people would like. So the question really is like despite the yields being challenged, why are we not seeing like an increase in process control intensity as one would have imagined like a few years ago? It seems to me like whenever you have yield challenges, process control used to benefit. Is there some change going on here? And is there a different way that we need to think about when yield challenges are there and not just in the process control segments that KLA is serving here?","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah well, I think if you recall, we laid out the process control intensity model over a year ago at SEMICON and talked about the difference between what we'd see at foundry and logic and what we'd see in memory. And the biggest change in terms of our demand environment has really been associated with the shift toward an increase in memory concentration, which inherently, although the new nodes have more process control intensity than the prior nodes, they're almost half of what you see in logic and foundry.","The logic and foundry intensities have been in general okay, but what we've seen recently is logic is almost at a historic low in terms of at least for the last 10 years, their investment right now is they're on pause. The other thing that happens is in foundries they might have a big focus on yield, but if then the business isn't won then what we see is the investment then stops altogether because it went somewhere else. So we have experienced some of that as well.","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Farhan, the only other thing I would add to that is, is that so far, the process control intensity in a high mix foundry is higher than, let's say, a high volume logic fab. And given the level of activity we've seen with design starts at so far 20, 14, 16, most of the behavior has been more in line with high volume logic-like adoption levels where customers are running high volume products. And so end market activity is a driver of process control adoption. And the limited end-market activity so far has had an impact on the intensity for sure.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you have any view on the order mix for calendar 3Q?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so for September, it looks like 43% memory and foundry 35%, logic 22%.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. And then where do we stand on the buyback and when do you expect to complete that authorization?","Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we've got in excess of 8 million shares remaining on the authorization. We repurchased $168 million in the June quarter. So we see a continuation over the course of the year, now approach is to do, what we call, a dollar cost average-like approach towards that over time. And so we'll continue to do it quarter in, quarter out. Certainly, we \u2013 as we manage our overall cash relative to our U.S. target, it does have an impact in terms of cash needs and in terms of where we ultimately end up around share repurchases.","And we are going to start to pay down the debt. We've started to do that in the last quarter and so that will be an aspect to the cash management going forward as well. So we're about halfway through, a little over halfway through and we'll see it continue over the course of the next 12 months or so.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Just a follow up question on the impact of Intel's CapEx cadence change. It wasn't clear to me, does this impact how you run KLA at all? Do you maybe throttle back manufacturing output? Or is the impact just not that meaningful since logic has been, I think you said, a smaller part of your orders recently? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, obviously if anyone is reducing their CapEx and our sensitivity to process control intensity is higher in foundry and in logic than it is in memory, that's we don't consider that a great thing, so that dials us back a little bit. If you think about the restructuring that we did, we talked about two motivators. One was to position the company better to deal with our customer challenges to get to market and be easier for our customers to deal with us. But the other side of that was to reduce our cost base, and we've done that. And if you look at where we are from the peak, we're down pretty significantly. So our view is that, in the event that this continues, we want to be positioned appropriately for our investments to support it. But we never know how long these things are going to go.","There are many examples in the past where customers give one direction and then change directions based on the way things go. And we're prepared for either one. But I think that we have taken actions to deal with, for us, what was a lower end market demand environment than we would have hoped for a couple years ago, but we also think that, in 2016, we will see a resumption of the investment.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for sharing that, Rick.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood.","Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Connor.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM, Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website.","There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.

Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us today for our March 2017 Earnings Call. I plan to briefly cover three things with you in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick look at KLA-Tencor's outstanding performance in March followed by a look at highlights of the very strong market share performance delivered by the company in 2016, and then concluding with an updated outlook for industry growth for KLA-Tencor in 2017.","Let's begin with the March quarter. KLA-Tencor delivered excellent results in March, thanks to another outstanding performance by our employees in executing the company's growth strategies in what is a very exciting and dynamic period for the company and for the semiconductor industry as a whole.","March shipments, revenue, and diluted GAAP and non GAAP earnings per share all came in above the mid-point of our range of guidance with shipments finishing at a record $909 million in the quarter.","During the quarter, we experienced strength across our inspection and metrology portfolio with growth in market leadership metrics for the March quarter continuing the momentum we achieved in calendar year 2016 and highlighting by the quarter record for our unpatterned wafer inspection products.","Working in close collaboration with leading global semiconductor device manufacturers,","KLA-Tencor's strategies are focused on ensuring our customers' success. This effort is helping to address the most complex manufacturing challenges for inspection and measurement in the marketplace today in both development and capacity monitoring applications.","These challenges include patterning and process window issues associated with EUV and multi-patterning lithography and as the industry moves to smaller dimensions and three-dimensional structures to address cost, power, and device performance improvements. Our successful execution of these strategies continues to bear fruit in terms of market leadership and relative outperformance of KLA-Tencor. In fact, the recent market share numbers from Gartner show the overall process control segment grew 11% in 2016 or roughly in line with WFE industry growth in the year. In that period, total revenue for KLA-Tencor grew 14% and systems revenue grew 18%.","The 2016 share data also shows KLA-Tencor increased our market leadership in process control by about 300 basis points in the year, reflecting our focus on market and technology innovation in the most critical applications in inspection and metrology, as well as the breadth of our product and services portfolio.","We saw a particular strength in 2016 from optical wafer inspection. Recent successful new product introductions in this flagship market for KLA-Tencor including the launch of the new Gen 5 broadband plasma platform, plus strong customer acceptance of the Gen 4 platform for a leading-edge capacity monitoring and successful new offerings in laser scanning patterned wafer inspection as well as unpatterned wafer inspection, together contributed to expansion of the total available market for process control and growth in KLA-Tencor's share of the process control market in 2016.","The story for metrology in 2016 was highlighted by the growth in optical CD metrology, which is the preferred technology for an increasing number of CD metrology applications. Optical CD is playing an enabling role in the proliferation of advanced 3D device architectures and leading-edge memory and logic, measuring not only line widths but also profile features on the chip.","The robust market share and relative growth delivered by KLA-Tencor in 2016 are the results of continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address the most complex inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive growth in innovation in a period of solid sustained performance for the semiconductor industry.","Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2017, as March results have indicated across the board, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today are solid and broadly based, supporting a growth outlook for the overall WFE industry that's expected to be in the mid-single-digits or higher in 2017.","Given the momentum in demand demonstrated in the March quarter results and with upside to the original industry growth estimates for the year coming from a broadening of the competitive landscape in 10- and 7-nanometer foundry, we now see WFE growth favoring the upper end of the initial range of our estimates for 2017 and our preliminary view of the 2018 industry landscape points to a continuation of these investment trends.","Given a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage and ranks KLA-Tencor in the top tier of leading semiconductor companies and coupled with leadership position in each of the most critical process control markets, the March quarter results show that the stage is set to build on the momentum of calendar 2016 and deliver what we plan to be a year of double-digit revenue growth in 2017 for KLA-Tencor.","Now turning to guidance for the June quarter, shipments are expected to be in a range of $890 million to $970 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be in a range of $885 million to $945 million with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share.","And I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor.","Shipments, revenue, and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management and our manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was $914 million in the March quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 in the quarter and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62.","In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now turning to highlights of the March quarter demand environment. Although we are no longer guiding quarterly orders, for the time being, we will continue to share our perspective on the current end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends in KLA-Tencor's performance. Upon completion of an upgrade of our internal analysis systems, our plan is to begin providing end market mix detail for shipment results and guidance beginning in September quarter.","At that time, all end market customer mix, business segment, and regional breakdowns will be provided on a shipment basis and we will discontinue all formal order commentary including disclosure of the quarterly results. But for now, for the March quarter, new orders were $990 million. Foundry was 54% of new system orders in March, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes.","We are currently modeling foundry orders to be approximately 50% of the total in the June quarter. Memory was 42% of new orders, with investment evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling memory orders to be about 40% of the total in the June quarter, with NAND representing about 60% of the memory mix. Logic was 4% of new system orders and is currently forecasted to be approximately 10% of the June quarter total.","In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of calendar 2017; wafer inspection was 56% of new orders; patterning was 21%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business; non-semi was approximately 3%; and service was 20% of total orders. Total shipments were a record $909 million in the quarter, finishing above the $890 million midpoint of guidance for March.","Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to be a new record at the midpoint of guidance and be in a range of $890 million to $970 million. Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels in excess of $900 million and we expect this trend to extend at least through the second half of the calendar year. This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January. Current expectations are for second half of 2017 shipments to be up mid-single-digits versus the first half of the calendar year.","Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $914 million in March, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $945 million in the June quarter.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.5%, in line with expectations for the quarter. The strong gross margin performance in March is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. Compared to the December quarter, the benefit of the incremental sequential revenue was offset by a less favorable product mix in the period.","Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% and 63.5%, up about 50 basis points at the midpoint versus the March quarter, due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter.","As we highlighted last quarter, going forward, we expect to deliver gross margin results a couple hundred basis points above our 2015 published business model targets due to a number of factors, including customer reception of new product offerings, more efficient new product introduction execution, and improved variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations.","Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $224 million in March, up about $3 million compared with December and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. We are modeling operating expense levels of between $234 million and $238 million in the June quarter due to higher compensation expenses and prototype materials expenses for current programs.","For calendar 2017, we are modeling operating expenses to be around $950 million due to incremental investments in product road maps supporting 3D NAND and EUV inspection and metrology opportunities as well as higher variable compensation expense. Given our gross margin expectations, we expect to continue to deliver operating margins solidly above our published model for the foreseeable future.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter, just below our previously guided long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. You should assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes.","Finally, net income \u2013 non-GAAP net income for the March quarter was $256 million and we ended the quarter with 158 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","I'll now turn briefly to highlights on the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $111 million compared with the December quarter. Cash from operations was $225 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $215 million.","In March, we paid an aggregate of $86 million of regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $25 million towards our outstanding term loan. We expect to continue executing our delevering commitments over the remainder of the calendar year, consistent with our leverage targets.","In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in March reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer's growth strategies at the leading-edge and in legacy design rules, and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, position the company for another year of greater-than-market growth and an overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow mid-single-digits or higher in calendar year 2017.","This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of the portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading-edge, and our operational core competencies.","With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is: shipments in the range of $890 million to $970 million; revenue between $885 million and $945 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.44 per share to $1.64 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter.","I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed?","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, I'd like to open up the call up to Q&A. And we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow-ups and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to follow up in today's call as time permits.","All right, Christine, we're ready for your first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Bren, I just wanted to ask you about maybe as you think about updating your model. Everyone else is coming out with these financial models that are tied to WFE. And it looks pretty obvious that this year, WFE, you guys aren't quite as high, but if you look at the other guys, they're thinking like high, high 30s, maybe $39 billion. So it seems like $40 billion is now sort of like the new norm almost. So I'm wondering, can you give us a sense of what EPS would be in a new model at a $40 billion WFE? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, Tim, we haven't published a new model so it's a little bit difficult for me to answer that in terms of different WFE levels. I mean, I think the way you have to work through that is, as I've said around the revenue performance from an operating margin perspective, I think we're operating a couple hundred basis points better than what we have published before.","But the easiest way to model that is if you're talking about in nearer term, and I think it's important assumption, are we talking now or a year from now and so on? But if you're just thinking in nearer term a $40 billion environment, you'd have to think about process control intensity on that. And I think in calendar 2016, process control intensity was below 13 percentile, so somewhere between 13% and 14%. The mix of business would be a factor in that.","Market share was Gartner just reported 51%. We've got internal objectives to gain share at least a point of share a year over the next few years so that's certainly a factor there. And then our service business, which is currently \u2013 would be somewhere around $800 million into calendar 2017. So if you put all that together with the operating margin, I suggest that I think you can probably work your way to an EPS result.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Awesome. Thanks. And then I guess, Rick, a question for you. So there's a lot of concerns that have actually gotten a lot of questions recently about some perception that there's a lot of reuse between 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. I guess it sort of ignores all the investment that still has to be made at 10-nanometer. But can you talk about that? I guess it comes down to how much backfill there is on 10-nanometer. But can you talk about that from like a high level? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Absolutely, Tim. I think the biggest issue associated with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer is the number of design starts that there are that are ultimately going to land at 7-nanometer. And 7-nanometer is a much more significant node than what we saw with 20-nanometer going to 16-nanometer, so therefore we don't see reuse as being as significant, mainly because there's going to be such an expansion in the overall capacity.","So we think that will drive our intensity and it'll be more like what we saw with the 28-nanometer node. When you combine 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, it'll look more like that. So we feel pretty good about how that is playing out. Not only that, you have multiple players in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer race, so you've got broad industry support, a number of foundries all competing for that as there are increased starts.","Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking my question. My question is regarding the OpEx increase in second half of the year. Can you just talk about, what exactly are you investing? And you touched a little bit upon EUV opportunities, and I just want to understand, like, is there something new that you're doing in that area or just accelerating some of the programs that you had there?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, Farhan. Thanks. It's a good question. So there is some acceleration, I would call it incremental investment. We think there are opportunities for us on the inspection side. Well, frankly, metrology side as well for driving more process control into 3D NAND. And so there are a number of efforts in the company that are focused on that. There is also work that we're doing to enable EUV development activities. And so there's work there.","Finally, the industry has strengthened, certainly the company performance has strengthened. So there's some variable comp dynamics that are part of that. And so when you add it all up, it looks like it's about $20 million higher for the year than what I was suggesting back in January.","But our outlook has strengthened as well. So I think if you look back January versus today, we're probably in excess of $200 million of incremental revenue to where we see things today. And so if you follow our traditional drop-through model of operating margin, it's an incremental $20 million or so on costs.","So it fits our model and we see it as an opportunity to invest in some of these big opportunities, we think, that will help drive process control intensity into 2018 and 2019.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. And then, Rick, you talked about 2018 outlook looking positive at this stage. Can you maybe touch on some of the product drivers that give you confidence of some growth in 2018?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Sure. I think that as you look out into 2018, what you see is that the investment timeframe that'll include work on the 5-nanometer, so as you get to later in the year, and then continued expansion in addition to additional capacity being brought on by the guys who aren't in the lead in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, so that's really from the foundry standpoint.","Memory, you have continued investment going on kind of across the board. And our process control intensity is strengthening in memory so we see continued drive from that. And, of course, we've all talked about the investment that's going on in China. So right now it looks pretty good and our customers are certainly excited about their prospects as we go forward.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, I imagine you have a pretty good view today in terms of the capital intensity as we migrate down to 7-nanometer and would love to hear your thoughts on what that intensity looks like from process control vis-\u00e0-vis 10-nanometer or 14-nanometer, whichever is easier as a compare for you?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, so, C.J., it's Bren. I mean, as we look to calendar or we look at 7-nanometer, I mean, 7-nanometer has a full shrink. You're shrinking in the front-end. You also have your shrinking in back-end in transistor wiring. So we think that that coupled with the multi-patterning schemes, the process integration structures that customers are doing with these new materials in the back-end will create a number of process window challenges, we think, will be good for our business. As we move into 7-nanometer, we have a number of new products that'll come out that customers will be able to try to address some of these technology challenges but also drive cost of ownership.","So I think process control intensity per wafer goes up somewhere in that 20-ish percent range or so. Obviously, the number of wafer starts ultimately over time and design starts will be a factor in that because lots of designs change how customers invest. But how we're looking at it now is I think that to Rick's earlier comments, I mean, reuse will be limited. And I think the new product introductions plus the technology road map will be a good driver for our business.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, if you make the assumption that your revenues and market grows in calendar 2018, will the OpEx uptick we just saw be temporary or will that continue? Will you continue to invest given the heightened revenues? And this is just investments, not including the increase in variable comp.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, the variable comp will adjust, right? So that's one factor that will play out as we move into 2018. I think the easiest way for you to think about modeling the company is back to the model that we had put out, we're targeting an operating margin level based on certain revenue targets. And we're exceeding the published model because of the strengths in gross margin, which we believe are sustainable. And so that's what's driving the outperformance. So as revenue grows, we will invest. And I think that as I outlined earlier, I think there's a lot of opportunities out there and so we'll invest in those. But we're committed to the operating model and that's how you got to think about it.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid results and on the outlook. Last call, you guys talked about the potential for shipments to be slightly down second half versus first half. Now you're expecting second half to be up by mid-single-digit percentage points. So maybe you can just help us understand what's driving the better second half view. Is it foundry, logic, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer? Or is it memory? Is it legacy China? Is it a combination of all of the above?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren, and thank you for the comment. It really is more of an all-of-the-above statement. Certainly, logic, foundry into the second half of the year has strengthened it terms of the shipment profile. And we certainly saw that versus where we were in January. So now it looks like it's up a little bit and it's been really filling out in the December quarter. So we feel pretty good about that.","I think in China we continue to be surprised by the customer pull that we see from those customers, so that's a factor in it as well. But I think all segments right now are investing and are putting a lot of pressure on us in terms of quick delivery. So I think the good thing about the upside we're seeing is it's quick orders and quick deliveries which will enable us to drive some revenue performance in the second half. But that's basically what's driving it.","And I think finally the only other thing is that the order profile, so you look at the backlog that we're bringing into the year, the order result March, what we expect to be a book-to-bill greater than 1 in June. So we've got a fair amount of sort of backlog or runway in terms of what we see coming and how to scale and plan the factory through the second half of the year.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Just add to that, Harlan, I think one of the things that changed in the last three months is we were anticipating but not convinced that there was going to be this broad support for the 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer across multiple customers. And we see a lot more evidence of that now, so that really has strengthened the foundry side of the equation, to Bren's point, driving all those things. So it was a good quarter from that regard.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great insights. Thank you for that. Recently on the memory side, we were talking to the CTOs of one of your large 3D NAND memory customers. And when we asked him about his equipment spending intensity going from 2D to 3D, he's saying that most of his buys are three areas: number one, deposition; number two, etch; number three, metrology. And this was for 32-layered 3D. They're transitioning to 64-layered now and still saying that metrology tool buys are a very high priority.","So I know that you guys have been wanting to collect more data on this but it seems that on the metrology side, whether it's overlay, film thickness measurements, CD, whatever, that your metrology intensity for 3D is increasing pretty dramatically over 2D. So, first of all, are you seeing this sort of higher metrology intensity on 3D versus your prior assumptions? And is there any way to quantify that?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Harlan, yes. So, I mean, the metrology side has been pretty healthy. The concern we had was actually on the other side and the defectivity side being lower intensity. And we're seeing that strengthen. And that's relatively early just due to the offerings that we have. But I think that was the area where we think there is more upside because of all of the work that people have to do to do disruptive tests. And as the complexity increases, there's more opportunity. So we do think the intensity goes up. And I think that if you look at planar, overall process control intensity for planar versus 3D, they're actually pretty comparable now and likely more upside to that as we go forward.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on gross margins. You're guiding Q2 gross margins to 62.5% to 63.5%, which continues to be a pretty strong level above levels we had seen two, three years ago. Is this kind of the new normal for the company and we should expect this to be a sustainable gross margin number or going forward should we expect kind of a reversion to the 59% to 60% range?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. It's a good question and really, we're seeing benefit in a lot of places. I mean, we're seeing improving margin profiles in service, we're seeing improving margin profile across products. New product introduction execution has been very strong in terms of how you manage from transitioning from one product to another. And at these revenue levels, I think the scaling of our factory and the leverage that exists in that has all been good.","So I don't envision a drop-off like you described. I mean, certainly, at these revenue levels, I think as I guided, I thought calendar 2017 was 62 plus or minus 50 basis points. I think we're probably at the higher end of that guidance range now as we look into next year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that suggests that this profile will change going forward. So we feel pretty good about it. And as I said earlier, I think what's driving how we're looking at our operating model and performance of various revenue levels is not so much about what we're spending, but how much more gross margin we think we're going to generate from our revenue.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then I had a follow-up on the wafer side of things. I think it's been about a decade since the Shin-Etsus and the SUMCOs and the Filtronics have expanded capacity in a meaningful way. And we hear more and more about very tight wafer supply these days. Just curious have you had preliminary talks with your customers about potentially expanding capacity or are they still very disciplined and still 12 to 18 months out before they make a meaningful change in their capacity plans? Thank you.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, we have ongoing conversations with them as they are \u2013 we're critical suppliers to them. And there has been levels of investment for technology capability on a routine basis. But we have seen expansion recently and 2017 looks like it's going to be a very good year overall relative to capacity in support of increased capacity demands. So that business is part of the strength that we're seeing.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","So the only thing I'll add to that is that in our unpatterned inspection business, we had a record year in FY 2016 and we just had a record quarter in that business in the March quarter from an order perspective.","Now some of that is 3D NAND because 3D NAND is driving unpatterned inspection.","They basically use these tools to monitor the deposition equipment to ensure cleanliness and so on, but also the wafer activity is a part of that.","And I think that's starting and we expect to see that growing a little bit over time here and it'll be a nice tailwind as we progress through this year.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thank you and congratulations. I think there's been this perception or there was at least, as memory spending grew as a percentage of WFE, KLAs revenue growth would underperform. That's kind of the trend that we saw in 2014 and 2015. But more recently, the revenue performance has been substantially better in spite of pretty healthy memory spending.","I can't say I appreciate what's the difference this cycle. And if you could talk maybe a little bit about if DRAM continues to grow as a percentage of WFE, how does KLA do in that environment?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, there's really two things. One, what we saw in the period you referred to where it was underperforming \u2013 where we underperformed, I think the other thing that happened in addition to the mix shifting quite fast toward memory. You also had a lot of reuse happening, so it was kind of a combination of factors that played against us.","What we have now is expansion of capacity continuing in foundry. Foundry continues to be reasonably strong. Less reuse, more players in our memory process control intensity going up over time, and then some other factors like the last conversation we just had like the OEMs and the wafer manufacturers investing.","So really a broad customer base. On top of all that, we have China, where the process control intensity tends to be higher overall because these are smaller projects. So we have a lot of factors working in our favor that are supportive of our revenue growth performance.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So is it fair, Rick, to say that you're sort of agnostic to the mix of WFE?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Not agnostic. We have a much higher percentage of adoption in foundry than we do in memory. But unless there is a major shift in terms of the relative performance, we believe we'll continue to perform in line or better than the industry as we go forward.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So recently one of (34:57) your customer and I think we've heard from other people as well that there's talk about shrinking from 20-nanometer to 22-nanometer rather than moving down to 14-nanometer and then 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, right? And how would that benefit or affect your business? Do you expect that shrink to drive increased process improvement?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","I'm sorry from 28-nanometer to 22-nanometer, is that what you said?","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Yes. Yeah.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. Sure. I mean, any time there is any kind of shrink going on, there tends to be increased demand for, especially in the wafer side, wafer inspection side for finding smaller defects. So that will drive it. But you're talking about a relatively small part of our overall market. So you wouldn't see as big a change as you would in a node shift down to 7-nanometer, for example, if that makes sense.","But sure, any of those trends are good, and especially when the fabs \u2013 from our standpoint, if it's the smaller fab doing it, the relative process control intensity is higher just because of where they are on the yield curve and on the volume curve, if that makes sense.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Actually that's helpful color there. And then on your guidance outlook, I think you've talked about a logic order picking up this quarter. Is this kind of renewal resumption of spending by the logic guys or was it just a kind of one-quarter timing of things?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. I think when you look across the year, our view on logic spending in 2017 versus 2016 is relatively flat, so I think it's a quarterly dynamic more than anything. So, yeah, I think it's just \u2013 we got orders that are going to get placed and numbers a little bit higher next quarter.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, Rick and Bren. Congrats on the results and the guidance. I just had a follow-up question on WFE spend from China. In China, we are continuing to see satellite pictures of some of these big domestic China fabs making pretty good progress constructing their shelves. How impactful do you think domestic China WFE will be this year for pilot line equipment? Thanks.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, when you look at our order profile, I mean, it was so what we saw in 2016 and what we expect to see in 2017 for the most part is foundry-centric. And so it was roughly 15% of foundry orders in 2016 and maybe 25% of foundry orders in 2017. I think what's interesting is while the memory investment from a shipment perspective is more of an 2018 and beyond dynamic, we are starting to see memory orders show up in the funnel. And so as we look, I'm not sure exactly when we'll see those orders booked, whether we'll see them booked in June or whether we will see them booked in September. But they are for shipments in early 2018.","And so your question about progress on the facilities is a good one, and so far as we monitor that and we begin to staff up in anticipation of supporting these ramps, these are factories we watch pretty closely. But right now, there's a lot of activity there and we're chasing trying to hire people and ramp up to be able to support those customers in a pretty diverse fab footprint overall across the country.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Bren. And then a follow-up question on the market share gains that KLA saw last year. Do you get the sense that customers were waiting for KLA's new products last year and the strong gains you saw last year should continue into this year as well? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","I certainly think we create more momentum with new products in general than in the industry cycle. So a new product cycle is very good for us. And I think that in this case, there are two things. One, there is a large-scale adoption of, in this case, our Gen 4. But not just that. We brought out the Gen 5, but also in metrology we had products that were meeting a need.","So I'd say that our market share position continues to be very strong. We are investing very heavily in new capability to bring it on. But the other thing we've done in response to the demand in China, we've actually restarted some of our product lines that are well-suited for that market because we believe market share in China is critical going forward.","The other thing that's going on there and you may be well familiar is one of the big challenges a lot of our customers have there is talent and engineering talent. So one of the other ways we can help is with the worldwide apps, presence and the ability to support them as they ramp, not only do they benefit but we benefit from strong share as well.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a solid execution. Two questions, Rick. First, on the 10-nanometer and the 7-nanometer, I'm just wondering, how should we think of growth between the wafer inspection and metrology? We have new materials being added and new dimensions with the FinFETs and things like that. So I just wanted to get your perspective on the growth between wafer inspection and metrology. Then I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Sure. Yeah. I think the way I think about it is the wafer inspection is really driving more capability in terms of \u2013 if you think about smaller defects and the actual scaling has happened to go into 7-nanometer, so not only do they need more capable tools but they have to run them at higher resolutions, which drives the utilization in a way that they need more capacity.","Metrology, there are more layers, especially with multi-patterning. So what you end up with is more capacity device in addition to increased technology. So on a percentage base, both are growing slightly different drivers between the two though.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Okay. Fair enough. I just wanted \u2013 the second question as a follow-up is I wanted to understand your momentum on your Gen 5 tool. And how should we think about the ramp in calendar 2017 versus calendar 2016? And is there a possibility of seeding Gen 5 into memory at some point? Thanks.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. Gen 5 is pretty much doing what we thought it would do. And like any new product introduction, not necessarily exactly in the places because it's kind of had different adoption in different locations. But we've broadened our penetration. And Gen 5 is now at both memory and at foundry and logic facilities. And we're seeing we've got multiple orders now in both foundry but also what we're seeing in memory.","So we feel pretty good about our penetration. We're on the plan that we laid out when we introduced the product in terms of our 2016 objectives. And Bren can talk to the details of that. And then we hope to be entering \u2013 through 2017 entering 2018 with a lot of momentum.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, I think as Rick said, it's going pretty much according to plan. We revenued four tools in 2016, our plan is to revenue 8 to 10 tools in 2017. To Rick's point, they're seeded all over in multiple customers so across all the settlements.","The other dynamic is driving Gen 5 besides the discovery opportunities where we compete more directly with (42:33) capabilities is that you're also seeing it deployed in EUV development situations too because it's used as a tool for radical verification when they print wafers and use the wafer results to calibrate pattern fidelity on the wafer or the reticle.","So there's an additional use case there that we're encouraged by and we're in line with our plans. And I think by the end of calendar year 2017, we should have somewhere between, I don't know, 15 and 18 tools or so in the field fully installed. So we'll see how many we actually end up with revenue beyond the plan, I told you, but there's \u2013 they're out there and getting deployed, demonstrating value.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Congrats on a solid execution.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job. Rick, in your prepared remarks, you talked about gaining share and seeing strength in unpatterned wafer inspection last year. What drove that strength in terms of end markets? Was it just the volume of wafers being kind of cranked out in 3D NAND, or which end markets drove that strength? And then I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, unpatterned really does benefit from 3D NAND. So we definitely see demand coming from 3D NAND. And we also see it just in general multi-patterning there are more layers and customers have long realized that monitor wafers can be a very efficient way to clean and maintain and come up from downtime on tools to re-verify their process. So that's really it. Plus we saw, as Bren said, we think the momentum continues based on some of the work we're seeing in the wafer manufacturers which are part of what was driving our March results. So we think that continues to be strong for us.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then on China, the investor community is still kind of skeptical on the Chinese projects, obviously there's 10-plus or these (44:36) and then 5 or 6 more active ones. But overall, when you look at these projects, do you think China has the expertise or the engineering talent to build and run these fabs or are we going to be seeing (44:52) build these fabs and just kind of learn through the experience and then kind of stumble or move towards low-end products (44:58)? I just want to get your sense of how ready China is to build fabs and then run them?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","It's a great question. Let's start with there's certainly a significant commitment, and I've been in this industry a long time and I would say I've heard this before out of China but we're seeing a lot more evidence now of actual commitment. There's also leadership has been put in place from other areas so you have experienced leaders now running a lot of these companies that have demonstrated their ability to run successful organizations in other parts of the world. So I think you have that.","The biggest gap probably ends up being the engineering workforce to be able to execute. And I think in that case, what we're seeing is a lot of these ambitious projects are also coming with requests for support from equipment companies. And so we're definitely feeling that and are participating.","We are relatively cautious too. And if you take our plans, we don't bake in everything that we hear that's said in China in terms of how we run the business. But we're also positioned to be able to support it, should it ramp. And I think the most significant part of that expansion to WFE is not in 2017 or 2018. It's actually toward the end of 2018-2019. And so I think it's still early. Right now we feel very good about the prospects for 2017, and the early 2018 numbers look very doable from our standpoint.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You answered this a little bit when you talked about the Gen 5 product and some of the applications that you're getting adoption for that product. But given the continued success of the Gen 4, is that slowing any of the, I guess, the product momentum for Gen 5 and that adoption given that Gen 4 is still, I guess, a workhorse tool for even these next-generation nodes?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Not really. I mean, I think that goes to two things. One is our customers have always sought the lowest cost solution for solving the inspection problems. So if we had not expanded the Gen 4, then maybe that would be the case. But the Gen 5 in its development isn't yet at a point where it could have offloaded those inspections. Whenever we introduce a whole new technology platform, we almost are forced to reduce the functionality of it on introduction, which is the case here. So it has capability but it doesn't have the same breadth of capability that a Gen 4 would have. That will happen over time, and as that does, the Gen 5 will take more and more of the layers as we go forward.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And as a follow-up question, given your strong exposure to the foundry segment, today we're seeing the second-tier foundries building out their 28-nanometer capabilities. How much of, I guess, your expertise in that node given that you've helped the other leading players ramp up on that years ago, how much are you helping out those second-tier players and how is that helping provide potential incremental business or even services opportunities with these second-tier foundries that are trying to get ramped up?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, we definitely have a close partnership with many players across the board on, say, 28-nanometer, and I do think we support them as best we can. We don't really make money on services from that. What we do is we support them with tool sales. Our market share tends to be pretty good, and we're committed to doing what \u2013 helping them with best practices in terms of ramping their facilities. These are very capable people, but they do often appreciate the support.","The other thing I'd mention is in some cases we've actually restarted some of the older products to be able to support them with exactly the capabilities that they need. So we're not selling the latest generation, in general, into those facilities. We'll sell a mix. Some new and some of the maybe Gen 3 kind of product line.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Market share, just only thing I'll add is market share tends to be stronger with those customers? And so what comes with that is, to Rick's point, the need for some additional support as we work through it. So we have applications engineers in fabs all around the world and they get deployed in these opportunities. And we think we benefit pretty well from the market position we have on the tools and these folks help the customers get value out of the tools.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. KLA-Tencor posted solid results that met or exceeded our expectation for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Our financial performance in Q2 was highlighted by gross margin and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance. Reflecting KLA-Tencor\u2019s strong competitive positioning in the most critical process control markets as well as a heightened focus on cost discipline across our worldwide operations.","New orders were also strong in Q2, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance at $865 million and up 53% compared to Q1. The recent end market demands trend continued in the second quarter with new orders from leading edge foundry and logic for sub 20-nanometer production comprising the majority of system bookings in December, followed by 20-nanometer capacity conversions in DRAM. As we look ahead to calendar 2015, with leading edge device demand expected to be strong and customer profitability expected to remain at high level, we are planning for another year of growth for the industry and for process control, with semiconductor WFE investment forecasted to grow in a range of 5% to 10% in the year.","In this environment of sustaining strong investment in the leading edge, the demand outlook for process control and KLA-Tencor\u2019s prospects also remain very favorable. In the near term however, demand remains fluid, particularly in foundry and logic, where we have recently seen orders from select customers slated for sub 20-nanometer, originally expected in the March quarter, pushed to later in the calendar year. We believe these delayed orders reflect yield and process stability issues associated with bringing these advanced device architectures to market.","Demand from memory customers remains robust, and in fact we achieved our highest quarterly bookings level for memory in Q2. Memory demand is expected to remain strong in calendar 2015 with 20-nanometer conversions in DRAM making up the majority of memory customer activity. NAND projects in calendar 2015 are expected to be largely focused on plainer architectures with expanded investment in 3D planned for later in the year.","As always demand growth in our business is driven by the strong pace of investment in next generation semiconductor device technologies by the market leaders in logic, foundry and memory. Process control plays a critical role in helping these customers solve the mission critical production problems associated with managing yields and leading edge manufacturing environment. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from these ever more complex and costly yield challenges.","So from our perspective 2015 promises to be an exciting year for KLA-Tencor. Looking beyond these near term market factors, we\u2019re well positioned in key markets with innovative products to execute our strategies for growth and market leadership and to deliver strong returns to our stockholders.","Turning now to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, new orders in March are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $700 million. Our current forecast shows orders in the first half of calendar 2015 on par with levels achieved in the second half of calendar 2014. Revenue guidance for Q3 is in the range of $685 million to $765 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.87 per share for the quarter.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bren, for his commentary on the quarter before returning for Q&A. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick and good afternoon. Revenue for Q2 was in the upper half of the range of guidance at $676 million and non-GAAP earnings per share finished above the guided range for the quarter at $0.68, driven by stronger than expected gross margins in the quarter and good execution of cost management, fully diluted GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.12. The GAAP earnings per share in Q2 included $0.53 of charges related to the leveraged recapitalization transaction, which we completed in Q2 and $0.03 of restructuring and acquisition related charges, net of the income tax effect on these adjustments.","My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude these adjustments. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share can be found in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our Website prior to this earnings call. New orders in Q2 were $865 million above the midpoint of guidance of $700 million to $900 million for the quarter. We continue to experience a high degree of variability in order timing and delivery day commitments from our customers. We believe this is the new normal for our industry, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 75% of demand today and often with one or two customers accounting for a significant portion of order and shipment volume in a given quarter.","With each customer having their unique timeline for executing their technology, investment and capacity expansion plans and with shorter product delivery lead times becoming normal in our industry, forecasting accuracy of bookings within a 12 week window has clearly become even more of a challenge. ","With that, though December orders and shipments were strong, the near term shift in customer demand requirements that Rick mentioned have resulted in certain shipments which were originally slated for the March and June quarters moving into the second half of calendar 2015. We see this is largely a timing issue and our optimism for calendar 2015 to be a growth year for KLA-Tencor is high.","Our internal shipments forecast for calendar 2015 is consistent with business levels that would support revenue growth for KLA-Tencor, in line with the overall industry growth rates and what is expected to be another year of strong CapEx investment, with shipment volumes roughly balanced across the first and second half for the year. ","Regarding customer segment commentary for the second quarter, combined foundry and logic customer demand was 56% of new orders in Q2, and slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to some marginal weakness at the leading edge. As I mentioned, we believe the near term volatility in foundry and logic is largely a timing issue and a function of a variety of factors including customer concentration and yield issues as well as shifting capacity requirements at the leading edge for 14 and 16 nanometer and the timing of early development activity for 10 nanometer. Memory bookings were a record in Q2, finishing at 44% of new system orders in a period with upside from DRAM. ","We expect memory demand as a percent of total system orders in calendar year 2015 to be on par with our calendar 2014 result, with investment focused on technology upgrades in DRAM and our capacity additions of plainer device architectures in NAND and 3D NAND. Investment by our customers at 20 nanometer and below constituted roughly 69% of the orders we received in the December quarter.","Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 47%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was approximately 20%, service was 20%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q2 were $766 million, up 40% sequentially from September. We expect shipping growth again in Q3 to a midpoint of approximately $785 million in the quarter. Given current shipment backlog, we expect shipment levels to remaining at a high level with first year calendar 2015 shipments expected to grow compared with the second half of 2014.","In total we ended the year with just over 1.3 billion of total backlog, comprised of 1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Total backlog includes $262 million of revenue backlog of products that have been shipment and invoiced, but have not yet have been accepted by customers.","Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $676 million above the midpoint of the guided range and up 5% compared with Q1. Gross margin was 58.5%, an increase of nearly 3% from September and significantly above the guided range for the quarter. Our gross margin significantly exceeded guidance for the quarter due to a favorable mix of products and services and better than expected manufacturing efficiencies due to output levels and favorable foreign exchange impact in our off shore factories. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56.5% and 57.5% in the March quarter as the benefit of higher revenue volume is offset by a less favorable product mix compared to the December quarter.","The shipment dynamics related to today's operating environment have also added additional volatility to our gross margins. Over time our gross margin performance should continue to reflect our differentiated business model, which is fueled by 50% to 70% incremental gross margins. Operating expenses were $231 million, down from $240 million in Q1 and below the guided range of $236 million to $238 million for the quarter, as we saw the benefit of a heightened focus on cost management.","Over the past few years we have made critical investments in R&D and customer application support, advancing the product roadmap for flagship products such as Broadband Plasma and latest scattering wafer inspection technologies and the Archer platform in overlay metrology. We\u2019ve also made investments in new opportunities for growth, such as the 5D patterning control solution. We believe there are additional opportunities to continue to meet customer requirements and sustain our market leadership, while driving better cost efficiencies throughout our organization.","Looking ahead, we are modeling operating expenses of approximately $227 million to $229 million in the March quarter and expect operating expense level to decline over the course of the calendar year to about $220 million per quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $29 million, reflecting the impact of the debt on the balance sheet resulting from our leverage tree capitalization. We expect OAE to be a net expense in March of approximately $30 million.","The tax rate was 16.4% in Q2, lower than the 23% revised guidance rate for the December quarter, principally driven by the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. Going forward, you should continue to use a long term planning rate of 22% for modeling purposes. At the 22% guided tax rate, earnings per share would have been $0.64 in Q2. Net income was $113 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, a decrease of 576 million compared with September. This reflects the impact of the leverage recapitalization transaction we completed in the December quarter. In conjunction with this transaction, we issued an aggregate amount of 2.5 billion of senior notes with various maturities with a blended interest rate of 4.28%. We also entered into a $1.25 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. This credit facility consists of $750 million of amortizing term loans and commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of $500 million. The interest rate on the $750 million credit facility is 1.49% based on current rates.","With proceeds from the leverage recapitalization, we paid a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share for a total amount of $2.76 billion. Concurrent with our leverage recapitalization, we also announced that the Board of Directors has authorized an expansion of our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced in July by an additional $250 million. In quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $69.94.","As of December 31, we had approximately 14.8 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We plan to execute these share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition to the $16.50 special cash dividend in December, we paid a regular dividend of $82 million or $0.50 per share in the quarter. Cash from operations was $11 million in the quarter, down $24 million sequentially, largely due to the higher account receivable associated with the ramp in shipments in the quarter and monthly shipment linearity. And lastly, fully diluted shares ended the quarter at $167 million. In conclusion to reiterate, our guidance for the March quarter is, new orders are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $700 million, revenue is expected in the range of $685 million to $765 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.87 per share.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay, thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. We once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Please feel free to re-queue for you follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. Candice.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Timothy Arcuri","Bren, your commentary on the first calendar half of the year, did I hear that right in that it suggests that the June orders are going to be up like 35% - 40% sequentially and I guess does that assume that the push outs on FinFET, that they come in June or is that they\u2019re more additive to that during the back half of the year? Then I had a follow-up.","Bren Higgins","So Tim, it\u2019s a good question. So when we looked at it, we saw a similar profile to the second half of calendar '14 with the weaker first quarter with some bounce back into the June quarter. So it looks -- as we size the six month period, it looks pretty similar to us. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I think that the 12 week widow dynamic is becoming a more challenging dynamic for us to forecast with the customer concentration we have and size of orders and so on. So as we look at the six month window, it looks like it\u2019s roughly the same size.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay thanks. And then just on margin, Bren. At this revenue level, margins are a very good 150 basis points below. I'm just looking at the March guidance. They\u2019re good 150 basis points below where -- if you kind of average out where they've been over last couple of years at that particular revenue level, it seems like you\u2019re giving up about 150 basis points on margins. What exactly is happening there with the mix and will you get that back in June?","Bren Higgins","Well, the mix factors are -- for the same reasons we talked about with the shipment plans, as you ship tools to customers and you\u2019re shipping more to individual customers, you\u2019re revenuing tools faster. So in some ways, your margin is impacted by the mix of products your shipping to a greater degree than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Clearly margins were extremely strong in Q2 for the reasons we talked about and there is some correction of that in the March quarter. I think if you\u2019re modeling out our business at this $3 billion run rate, I expect to see gross margins somewhere between 57% and 58%. There are obviously the mixed dynamics that will play out in any given quarter, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re modeling it today.","Rick Wallace","And I think the other thing to keep in mind is the growth of our -- Tim, I think one other thing to keep in mind is the growth of our service business, while accretive at the operating margin level is dilutive to our gross margins. The way we do our accounting, there is no operating expenses there. So we believe it\u2019s -- there is an impact, dilutive impact to gross margins from that dynamic in services in the low 20 percentile of our revenue mix.","Operator","And your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Farhan Ahmad","Can you briefly talk about, like the push outs that you saw, are they coming more from the leading edge sub-20 nanometer production as you mentioned? Is it coming from primarily in U.S. region or is it coming from overseas, some foundries? Can you just briefly describe which region did you see the push outs from?","Rick Wallace","Well, we came in obviously stronger versus the midpoint in Q2. So certainly that impacted our views on Q3 with some pull ins in the Q2. But in terms of Q3 versus what we thought, it\u2019s really a mixed bag across foundry and logics. So its leading edge, but also some of the trailing edge business that we\u2019ve been forecasting for some time and has been a bit allusive and I think that\u2019s dependent ultimately on some competitive dynamics in terms of second source strategies and so on. So I would say it\u2019s across the Board in terms of what we saw in Q3, and as I said earlier some of it we think comes back in Q4. ","Farhan Ahmad","And then, second question I have is just talking about your next six month forecast, you're talking of revenues being flattish, half and half. If I look at the EBITDA level that you had in second half of calendar year, it's about $313 million. Assuming that your profitability and revenues are similar, you're looking at like EBITDA levels of about 600 -- $26 million and $30 million, do you think that there is some risk to the debt-to-EBITDA covenants as we look for a year or two? Your EBITDA profile seems pretty low compared to what it was a year ago, in terms of like -- if I look at the six months period from now and the past six months, and compared that to the previous one year, it's down quite a bit? ","Bren Higgins","So our commentary on the first half was bookings related, not revenue. So I expect the revenue to be higher than bookings. I won't guide June obviously but I don't we will see sequential growth into the June quarter. So I don't have the math in front of me on EBITDA, but as I've looked at it relative to the covenants I have with bank debt is that we feel pretty comfortable with the level we have relative to what our expectations are for the business going forward. So I don't have any concerns based on what we see today. Obviously with the backlog position we have and our expectations for shipments into this quarter, June should set us for a sequential increase and improving operating profitability. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. ","Krish Sankar","Two of them. First one, Rick or Bren, it looks like you're running at a $600 million run rate for bookings in March and $800 million or so in June. What do the composition of those orders look like in March and June in terms of memory and foundry? And I had a follow-up. ","Rick Wallace","Yes, so we're not guiding the June quarter but for March. March looks to be pretty foundry centric, so 70% foundry. And memory is 19%, logic 11%. And NAND as a percent of the total memory mix is up 31%. ","Krish Sankar","Okay. That's helpful. And then a second question is one of things I noticed, both December, March and your guidance on OpEx is that, the OpEx seems to be coming up pretty strongly. It seems like -- just trying to find out, is this a function of you guys responding much faster, more aggressive on the OpEx side given gross margin or pricing might be under pressure or is it a function of the fact that there are some projects that don't need to be executed any more, like 450 or something else like that? ","Bren Higgins","Krish, you said coming up? Did you mean OpEx is coming down? ","Krish Sankar","OpEx is coming down, yes. ","Bren Higgins","Yeah. ","Krish Sankar","Okay ","Rick Wallace","So, Krish I think that's right. If you look at the last couple of years, we have had sustained investment in a number of key platforms in the program. Obviously we're investing in 450, investing at a slight level but investing EUV in addition to some growth opportunities like our 5D solution. Customer support, another area. And so we've invested according to the road map. We think we're in a position now relative to our road maps and our competitive position that we think that there are opportunities for us to start to scale this down somewhat. And so saw that momentum play out in the December quarter. We think it continues in March and progresses through the year. So we're also doing some things underneath the surface in terms of how we think about our sustaining engineering, how do we use offshore engineering resources more efficiently and so on, that we think we can drive the operating run rate down to the 220 range as we move through the calendar year. ","Operator","And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","C.J. Muse","I was hoping to go back to your comments on your customer concentration, because if we go back in time, you guys had great ability to manage through a six month backlog give or take, and clearly there was customer concentration issues then as well. And so just curious, is it movement of market share from one player to another? Is it enhanced customer concentration? What's driving the change in your business model? ","Rick Wallace","Well I think it's really our customers. Given the lead times that they have in the markets that they are supporting, I think their lead times have come in and I think we've seen that same pressure pushed back on us. So we have -- we had to change our business somewhat in terms of our ability to be flexible and respond. But in a lot of these cases, we will have these conversations where we'll ask for more lead time and our customers will push back, given the dynamics that they are facing. ","So there is less predictability. We've seen it for a while and I think it just changed versus where we were in the past. I think it's more the end markets and I think the concentration we have, very sizable orders, sizable shipments that are going to ship out, and as the customer changes the plan, that has a dramatic impact obviously on a given quarter's shipment. So our shipments tend to be pretty close to the ranges that we're guiding, but it's more of a challenge today and certainly impacts not just the overall shipment level, which has an impact on revenue but also the gross margin, given the mix of products that you're shipping. ","Bren Higgins","I also think if you think about consolidation, one way I would think about it is, I look at consolidation of our customer's customer in terms of their influence on the spend. So especially in the foundry space, their actions actually are often not really clear until very late to our foundry customers and that\u2019s part of the dynamic of the movement. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t get more visibility I think from our foundry customers.","C.J. Muse","That\u2019s helpful, and I guess as a follow up \u2013 Tier 1 was, how should we think about the uplift in your account receivables? And then the second one is, you\u2019ve shown really good growth on the service side. Will that continue, and how should we think about I guess service spares, as well as upgrades as part of that mix?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I\u2019ll take the service side. I do think we\u2019ll continue to see growth out of service. One of the things service is benefiting from on the, one way I think about it, the Internet of Things isn\u2019t really driving a lot of front end WFE spend, but it is driving the longevity of a lot of these fabs which is good for our service business. And so I think part of what\u2019s happening is that some of these fabs run longer and get more devices, we're the extension of the life of the tools that are being serviced and that\u2019s part of the underlying driver for our service business, which is great, and I'll let Bren handle the accounting part.","Bren Higgins","So the day sales outstanding was, on revenue about 85 days. So significant uptick there. And that was really a function of the monthly shipment linearity. We shipped a number of tools in December and in the last part of December or so. The cash collection will happen in the first quarter on those shipments and so I\u2019m expecting reversion back to normal 70ish or so DSO levels, plus or minus a few days, and it will drive operating cash flow probably up in the $250 million to $300 million range as we move into March, based on what we\u2019re expecting to ship today and the timing of those shipments so.","Operator","And your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Bill Peterson","Yes hi, good afternoon this is Bill Peterson calling for Harlan. I was hoping you can I guess share a little more color on this push out. Is it basically just one customer or is it broader participation? And I guess what gives you the confidence that these will materialize for the second half of the calendar year? What do you base the confidence on?","Rick Wallace","Well, if you look back, even some of the stuff that we pushed out, even within December and we were having very high level of conversations with customers that felt like they had pretty strong commitments from their customers to move forward and they were in process of allocating space and slots to support their ramp, and then very late in the day that got pushed and so some of those things even pushed outside of the March -- and into the second half. So when we look at the overall dynamics you say that we\u2019re in great shape share wise. The adoption seems to be working. What happens is these guys slide as the dynamics behind them are moving. And we see that both as Bren mentioned to the prior question, both at the leading edge and as we\u2019re seeing some of that in logic, but also some of the not leading edge, in the foundry space we\u2019re seeing movement.","So just go back to what are your assumptions about WFE for the year and what do you really think of foundry spend, and our view is, if in fact the WFE numbers work out, then we\u2019ll see them in the second half; but until -- as you know, until the orders are placed, it\u2019s very hard to know if they will. But if you go back to -- our underwriting assumption is WFE up 5% to 10% this year and the mix largely intact with what it was last year, we feel pretty good about how the year is going to play out. It\u2019s just the uncertainty has increased the volatility due to concentration.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Jim, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about your plans for paying down or refinancing the new debt, and whether or not 2 to 2.5 times is the leverage level to be thinking about?","Rick Wallace","So, we just borrowed the money. So we're not planning to refinance. We're pretty happy with the structure of the debt that I laid out in the prepared remarks. Our goal -- our long term target is 2 to 2.5 times. We think that makes sense for a business with our characteristics. We went above that in this case as I talked about in the last call, given the attractive lending environment, but also what we expect to be a healthy CapEx environment over the next couple of years. We structured the debt in a way that we can pay it down and we\u2019ll pay it down with -- the term loan piece, which is pre-payable with a lot of flexibility and how we do that. And so we\u2019ll do that over the next couple of years, working down to our long term target. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, thanks. And as a follow up, you mentioned in the last call that you\u2019re expecting multiple players to be on FinFET by the end of 2015. Have you, are you still expecting multiple players, or is that more of a one player?","Rick Wallace","In the foundry?","Unidentified Analyst ","Yes, in foundry.","Rick Wallace","So, I think you\u2019ll see multiple players. I think that\u2019s still our expectation, but to the point earlier, we\u2019re seeing a much more measured ramp up capacity for FinFET. I think the leader is comfortable with their position and the other players are working quickly to try to catch up, and I think the competitive dynamics on that front will ultimately drive how much capacity gets added over the course of the year. We think that is what\u2019s driving some of it into the second half, but ultimately I think you end up with multiple players with the capability.","Operator","And your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Your line is now open.","Edwin Mok","First one, did I heard correctly that you said you expect your shipment in the memory space to be roughly the same this year or flat to the last calendar year? And if that\u2019s the case, that would imply a very strong growth in foundry potentially in the second half. Is that how we should think about kind of shipment trajectory for your business?","Rick Wallace","Well we said orders. The order mix as a percent of the total, we expect it to be roughly similar, in the low 30 percentile. That was memory in calendar \u201815 versus calendar \u201814. There could be some timing issues, but generally that should translate mostly to shipments in a similar mix, but obviously the timing issues and the lead time can have an effect on that. For us from a pricing perspective, product mix perspective and so on, there\u2019s not a lot of difference in terms of what we ship in memory and foundry. So it doesn\u2019t really have an impact necessarily on the revenue levels or the margin profile of the various segments. So it\u2019s all pretty consistent across the segments for us.","Edwin Mok","And then on this foundry push out, maybe just some clarification there. So you mentioned there is some push out, not just in leading edge but also trench [ph] orders right? But then you also mentioned that as your quarter came in a little stronger than expected and there was some [indiscernible] on order. I\u2019m just trying to understand the dynamics, are these pushed out? Are you expecting a lot of these push out to be captured in the June quarter, which is you guide for higher order in June quarter, but some of that expect through the second half? In terms of shipment of these order given the push out, should we expect the shipment to come back in the second half, or is it more potentially delayed to \u201816?","Rick Wallace","Well, we had a nice bounce back in foundry from Taiwan specifically in the December quarter. So that was encouraging to see, but foundry was weaker than we expected going into the quarter. Most of the strength came from a much stronger memory and mix of business than we were remodeling. As we look at the next quarter or so, a couple of quarters, as we said earlier, it\u2019s a mixed bag. Its 20-nanometer and below. It\u2019s also some 28-nanometer business. And obviously there\u2019s also some 10-nanometer early activity that\u2019s part of that as well. So it\u2019s a collection of customers, and not huge amounts of dollars, but in the aggregate obviously had an impact on what we were planning for in the first half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Patrick Ho","Maybe a big picture question for Rick in terms of memory process control intensity. If I recall, at your Analyst Day last July, you mentioned that you expect to see process control intensity rise for the memory space. Looking at the DRAM spending that we're seeing today and the conversion to 20-nanometers, one, are you seeing this? And secondly is there a bias towards inspection or metrology, particularly as you see more multiple patterning steps at 20-nanometers?","Rick Wallace","Pretty much tracking the way we laid it out at SEMICON, in terms of memory. The one caveat I would say, for DRAM it is and back to the mix, it looks like historical mix. You do get overlay. To your point you get some strength there. But you also have advanced defect [ph] inspection to find some of these smaller nodes as you\u2019re pushing DRAM technology. So DRAM looks very much like we said. And as we said then, and even said in the last call, it\u2019s too early to tell on 3D Flash because there just hasn\u2019t been enough of it and its still early days on that. So whether or not that plays out to be at the intensity that we laid out, time will tell.","And given the latest -- the view that there is going to be more push out of 3D from what was expected even at SEMICON, I think that it will be the best of the calendar year for we'll really have validated that model. But I think for DRAM it has been tracking the way we assumed in this -- the historical mix looks pretty similar between metrology and inspection.","Patrick Ho","And as my follow up question, maybe also for your Rick. In terms of the foundry process control intensity, you guys saw a big pick up when 28-nanometers was rolling out, given the yield challenges. I guess the two part question there is, one, how come you haven\u2019t seen it yet with the 16 and 14 given the challenges there? And secondly do you think you\u2019ll get that kind of incremental step up that you saw at 28?","Rick Wallace","Yes. I think that the challenges associated with the yield right now, we\u2019re seeing sub-20 are not necessarily things that inspection and measurement can address. I think it\u2019s more a function of some of the just process integration. And while we could be helpful in diagnosing that, that\u2019s very different than addressing the manufacturing RAM. So we\u2019re still early days on that. Will we see it again? We\u2019re too early to say whether that will be validated in the rollout, because people aren\u2019t really far enough along in that development to know. But our expectations are that the signs are good. There are also some questions about utilization of existing facilities. For example will customers roll what is 20-nanometer capability to 16 and then what happens to the intensity in that scenario? And again, it\u2019s too early to know that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Rick, it seems like you a pretty good confidence with opportunities this year. It's just that the quarterly booking and shipments are lumpy, something that we went through last year. So given your confidence and also the lumpiness, why not provide us with kind of the year end guide so that we could avoid debating whether June will be up 30% or flat, and put the focus on your longer term opportunities, rather than trying to time the specific orders that have such a big variance, given the customer concentration.","Bren Higgins","So maybe I\u2019ll go ahead and start. So we try to provide a little bit more color in broader windows, six month window about we\u2019re seeing in the business over the last few quarters. And I think that\u2019s important. We\u2019ve also tried to give you some insight into where we are, based on where the industry is projecting to be where, we think we\u2019ll end up relative to that.","So for example, when we talk about calendar \u201915, I think in Rick\u2019s prepared remarks we thought given the dynamics of the mix of business across foundry and logic versus memory, that we would expect if the industry was up 5% to 10%, we ought to perform somewhere in line with market. We think that obviously the process control intensities of the two segments or three segments are different, with memory as a higher percentage. That does impact our ability to outperform the industry.","So as we look at it this year with roughly the same mix of business, we see a market perform year and I think that translates from a 12 month perspective into a $3 billion to $3.1 billion type performance level at the $33 billion and $34 billion WFE level, which is that plus 5 to plus 10 range. So we\u2019re trying to do it, all but at the same time, we feel like we don\u2019t to be less transparent in the process. We think the quarterly bookings are less relevant to our business today, given concentration and given that the industry is not as difficult as it was in the past. But it is something that we\u2019ve always provided and we\u2019ll continue to provide it. We've put a broader range on it and we\u2019ll do the best we can and then try to bridge it back to what happened versus what we thought would happen.","Rick Wallace","And Mehdi, to your point, I know you\u2019ve made this point before. I don\u2019t disagree with the thought process in terms of the lumpiness and how much help is it really. But on the other hand, as Bren said, we\u2019re reluctant to remove something, given the general view of the desire to have transparency. But it is something we debate from time to time. I could tell you it\u2019s not exactly how we run the business. When we go back and think about how do we run the business, how do we size the business and how do we make investments, it\u2019s not based on the quarterly numbers. It\u2019s based on what we view as trends, and even then, it's not even annualized. It's on a longer term basis than that. But your point is once again made.","Mehdi Hosseini","That\u2019s fair. And then my follow has to do with EUV. When you presented at a competitor conference in December, you highlighted some of the intimate conversation you\u2019re having with some of your customer. The big foundry in Taiwan is proceeding forward. What are you going to come down to? It seems like you\u2019re waiting for investment, the largest customer is proceeding forward. Is there a timeline here or are you just not going to proceed forward, even if your largest customer wants to move forward?","Rick Wallace","Well, I think that the way it stands today, that any production done with EUV before 2020 is going to be done without at [indiscernible] wafer, a reticle inspection. We are now too late to make any insertion point. And that\u2019s based on the fact that there is still a lot of debate by our customers about the relative tradeoff between the cost of us developing that technology and their confidence its need in production. So I'm not saying EUV won\u2019t go into production before 2020, because we don\u2019t know that. But I can tell you it won\u2019t go in production before 2020 with [indiscernible] reticle inspection. So either it won\u2019t go in production or they'll have to figure out how to deal without it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mahesh Sanganeria","I just want to get one more clarification on the foundry push out. ASML reported a pretty good booking, and I think that primarily came from Taiwan, and I think you commented that your booking had a pretty good Taiwan component. So my guess is that the push out you were seeing is not from Taiwan and other places?","Bren Higgins","Well, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s a mix group and it comes from a number of regions and in a number of nodes. So I think given lead time, I think certainly customers tend to get into the queue with litho sooner. I don\u2019t know exactly what ASML set or they positioned it. But as we look at it today, and into Rick\u2019s point earlier there is some fluidity to these orders, certainly at 28 nanometer and so they\u2019re moving around a little bit and so the timing is uncertain. And we're set to see how it plays out.","Mahesh Sanganeria","So can you comment on what could be the driver -- we know that was 2016 the driver is that the yield issues and customer giving allocation to different foundries, that\u2019s a big driver for 16-20 nanometer fluidity. What in your opinion is driving the changes at mature technologies?","Rick Wallace","I think it's a similar dynamic. It\u2019s just not happening so much with the leading edge foundries. I think there is significant competition for 28-nanometer foundry capacity, and we are seeing movement among those players as they try to win that business. So similar thing but just not with these exact same players.","Operator","And your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Weston Twigg","Just wondering real quick on the reticle inspection business, which I know is a good high margin business, but you've mentioned it\u2019s somewhat saturated. I was wondering if there is any opportunity for that to pick up a bit more as customers move to multi-patterning schemes, or do you think the installed base is generally pretty sufficient at this point?","Rick Wallace","It\u2019s a great question, Weston. I think that the -- we don\u2019t know the answer yet. I think that it\u2019s not as much about multi-patterning per se as it is sub 20-nanometer technology. So the multi-patterning above 20 I think is pretty well positioned. The question will be sub-20, are there new kind of inspection modes that require new algorithms new developments as people try to figure out exactly how to tune those reticles to support sub-20. And there are some indications that will create some boost in demand. But again, it\u2019s relatively early in that and we don\u2019t really see it.","So what mostly is happening now, we did have some good reticle business last quarter, but mostly what happening is in the fab and those tools are not fully -- those are not as complete tools. So you have a tool that\u2019s targeted at fab line that\u2019s a different kind of tool than what we sell in our shop. But we\u2019ll wait and see on that. I think that there is a good possibility that we\u2019ll see some increase in demand. I wouldn\u2019t forecast that in the very near term, no. I think that\u2019s a longer term thing.","Weston Twigg","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then just really quickly, wondering with the new cash balance, can you give us just an update on what\u2019s offshore versus onshore?","Bren Higgins","It\u2019s -- about 1 billion [ph] of it is onshore.","Rick Wallace","$2.4 billion onshore ","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Romit Shah","Rick, ASML said the other day that every single memory maker is increasing capacity. And I know you indicated that visibility in 3D NAND as a bit limited today, but I was wondering on DRAM, how do you see capacity playing out here in the first half? Is it increasing? And how would you describe the pace?","Rick Wallace","Yes, I think memory is setting up to have a good year again in 2015. We have seen strength in our memory business as we commented on the call. The December quarter was our best memory quarter and we see that continuing, and it is mostly in DRAM and we think for the year it looks that way with the 3D NAND being later in the year. So I think it\u2019s true and I think our adoption has improved, but again it\u2019s at the lower level that foundry. So from our standpoint, a mix shift toward memory doesn\u2019t increase our available market.","Romit Shah","And Bren just on the special dividend, I think it was a little controversial at the time, but in retrospect it looks it was a very good decision, and I'm curious how you\u2019re thinking about this going forward? Have you considered at all the idea of doing a smaller, but perhaps more frequent special dividend based on the performance of the business?","Bren Higgins","So I'll back up and our process is that as we evaluate the Company\u2019s strategic plan and we look at not only our cash reserves but the debt capacity that we have, we go through that process and we think about the alternatives of how we invest operationally, M&A considerations or shareholders return consideration. So that\u2019s a regular process for us. Clearly the shareholder return options are viable options, and I think in terms of value creation, the other options are juxtaposed against that. So clearly we have a long-term target, and in terms of leverage levels we think that makes sense, and as we de-lever the debt and we see the growth in EBITDA and our business we\u2019ll -- to the extent that that affords a position for us to run through that process and consider it again, it\u2019s a possibility but we'll run through the process and make the right call, based on what we think is in the best interest of the shareholders long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sundeep Bajikar","Two questions on foundry. First, what level of sub 20-nanometer foundry capacity do you currently expect to see get built or converted overall? And how much of this did you actually see get built in the December quarter, if at all?","Rick Wallace","So we just -- I think some of the 20-nanometer conversion will be largely determined by what happens with the end markets and whether -- the major customer there, as they migrate away from 20 does that capacity get consumed by other fabless customers. So I think that's the wildcard. I think that the 14, 16 capacity is really just starting to get at it. And so we'll see that capacity get at it over the next few quarters or so through this calendar year, with FinFET designs coming out of the foundries probably sometime in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. At least that's our best estimate at this point. ","Sundeep Bajikar","Okay. And just as a follow-up. What's typically the lead time in foundry? I know you said you don't have a lot of visibility, but if you can provide a perspective on how much the lead time might have shrunk, I think that would be helpful? ","Rick Wallace","It varies by customer across products, but I think we're -- generally if you look at our backlog with most customers we're usually -- it's about four months from the time that we get orders to the time we ship the tool. So it varies, but I think that's a reasonable way to think about it.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sydney [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. ","Unidentified Analyst","I just want to make sure that I hear that in your prepared remarks you mentioned the WFE market is going to grow 5% to 10%, but you expect your mix to be similar to 2014. I don't know if it's orders or revenue. But at the same time you also expect to grow in line with the WFE market. If I look back at 2014, I think the mix was -- if the mix is the same but you actually under grow the market in 2014, as well as '13, and I believe that one of the major reasons is because of mix. Can you help me reconcile how you're going to be able to grow in line with the WFE market? Is there some customer specific -- is there some intensity increase, that kind of thing?","Rick Wallace","Well think of it this way. If the mix stays the same year-on-year, then we shouldn't see under the market grows less than the overall market, right? What happened in '14 is the mix swung to memory. That make sense?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. ","Rick Wallace","So therefore it drove down the overall potential market for process control, because memory intensity is lower. If year-on-year the mix is the same as last year, then our compare is last year and then we ought to be able to grow with the market for this space. Does that makes sense? ","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, I guess the point is the mix didn't turn more unfavorable. ","Rick Wallace","Well it stays where it was. So as opposed to shifting. What happened in '14 versus '13 is it increased for memory, and that drove down available market for process control, right.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay ","Rick Wallace","If '15 ends up looking like '14, then that's your compare. And of course we hope to outgrow it, but when we're looking across the board. Now if memory is actually a larger percent, if that makes increases, then we'll be up against that headwind and we'll have to grow either through market share or driving additional adoption.","Unidentified Analyst","That makes sense. My follow-up question is on foundry. I think there are many questions on foundries, but it seems like there should be a big push for foundries in the first half and I know you talk about some push outs and what not. Is there enough visibility right now to look at what you think you're first half versus second half is? ","Rick Wallace","Well I think overall we can do the whole year and we look out and that goes back to WFE for the year. And as things slash around, and they are -- to Bren's point it can impact it, because late enough in the year our ability that revenue -- because of the shipments and revenue. But the dynamic right now is shaping up. We still think the year looks consistent with a up 5 to 10, but with some moving parts and we're not certain how they're going to play out. But we don't give guidance beyond the next quarter other than commentary on our perspective on the year. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lockwood for closing remarks. ","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Candice. That concludes our call for today.

Muse - Evercore","Patrick Ho - Stifel","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan","Operator","Good afternoon. My name is Christine and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA Corporation Investor Relations. You may begin you conference.","Theodore Lockwood","Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31st, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Wallace","KLA reported excellent results for the December quarter, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each closing above the range of guidance in the period. The December quarter caps the third consecutive year of mid-teens revenue growth for KLA. The consistent, strong financial performance we are delivering is a result of our continued customer collaboration, product innovation and outstanding operational excellence.","Our performance also highlights the strength and resilience of the KLA business model and the company's ability to consistently deliver long-term growth while delivering top-tier financial performance and strong cash returns to stockholders.","Consistent with this vision and with an eye to the future, on January 10, we unveiled the new name and logo for KLA Corporation. Our new, more contemporary brand honors the legacy of KLA's past and reflects our vision of the future for employees and for partners.","Now for some perspective on today's market dynamics. In terms of our view of the current WFE demand climate, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for a down year for the equipment investment in 2019, largely driven by meaningful declines in memory spend in both segments, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in advanced foundry and logic.","However, notwithstanding the near term market headwinds currently impacting WFE investment, the long term growth dynamics for the industry remains strong, fueled by larger and more diversified semiconductor device end demand and disciplined market-driven capacity planning.","The reduction in memory capacity investment we are seeing today is a result of weaker mobile demand and a pullback in data center. However, we expect supply and demand to rebalance over time given a more rational and disciplined capacity investment posture by customers.","In contrast to memory, leading edge foundry and logic investments have begun to ramp and momentum is expected to continue in 2019, reasonably balanced through the year with customers investing to support transitions to advanced nodes and the insertion of EUV lithography. For KLA, we have already seen our mix of business shifting to logic and foundry and investment from these customers is expected to remain strong in 2019.","Now for some highlights of our market leadership and product differentiation strategies. KLA continues to experience significant growth in demand for our wafer and mask inspection products driven by tighter wafer cleanliness and geometry specifications in the bare wafer market and the introduction of both EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops.","We're also seeing strong customer acceptance of recently released new products, including the revolutionary new Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms. Both products are being adopted in volume at multiple customer sites, demonstrating that our long-term R&D investments and product strategies are meeting market requirements and enabling customers to progress their advanced technology road maps.","KLA's service business also continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while generating strong cash flow. Service is expected to exceed $1 billion in calendar '19 and deliver long term annual revenue growth rates in the 9% to 11% range.","Growth in services is tied to a number of factors, including expansion of the installed base and more end demand for legacy applications, driving higher utilization of capacity and extension of useful life.","These are just a couple of examples of how our strategies for technology and market leadership are delivering results. As we move ahead in the new year, we remain focused on advancing our long-term strategies, positioning the company for success and continuing to deliver strong financial performance and long-term stockholder value.","To conclude before handing the call over to Bren, I'd like to give a quick update on the status of the Orbotech transaction. KLA and Orbotech are continuing to work cooperatively on approval of our transaction with the Chinese antitrust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and we're finalizing discussions with them.","We expect to receive China regulatory approval this quarter. Given the timeliness and sensitivity of these discussions, we will forgo any further discussions and will not answer additional questions regarding the transaction until we have new developments to discuss.","This concludes my comments for today. Now I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance in the quarter.","Revenue was $1.12 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.44 in the December quarter. In today's press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.","As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now for highlights on the December demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were a record $1.09 billion, above the range of guidance for the quarter. The upside to our shipping guidance was a result of pull-ins of approximately $65 million of deliveries originally scheduled for the March quarter. As a result of these pull-ins, the shipment results for the second half of calendar '18 were essentially flat with the first half.","Our outlook for March quarter shipments is in the range of $860 million to $940 million, with the quarterly sequential decline in shipments a function of these pull-ins into the December quarter as well as the shift in delivery dates from two memory customers that occurred very late in December.","Though visibility in the industry today is challenging and customer plans remain fluid, particularly in memory, our current view is for the second half 2019 shipments to be greater than the first half, a result of the factors I just discussed and our latest customer delivery expectations for 2019.","Memory was 61% of semiconductor shipments in December. DRAM accounted for 38% of system shipments. We expect memory to be approximately 40% of shipments in the March quarter. Foundry was 24% of shipments in the December quarter and is forecasted to be about 50% of the total in March.","Logic shipments were 15% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 10% of shipments in March. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 28%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 21%, and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%.","I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.12 billion in December and $50 million above the midpoint of guidance. We expect March revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $960 million. March revenue levels are lower than we expected back in October.","As highlighted in our recent earnings reports, the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition means that quarterly revenue levels are now more closely tied to quarterly shipments. Due to this dynamic, the shipment pull-ins we experienced in December have led to meaningful revenue upside in the quarter but at the expense of the March quarter. This coupled with the memory shipment delays I mentioned earlier, are lowering our revenue expectations for March.","Due to our record shipment backlog and expectations for system shipment scheduling for the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the March quarter will be the low point and anticipate sequential revenue growth to resume in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of calendar year '19.","Gross margin was 63.6% in December, 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance as the modest improvement in product mix was offset by slightly higher manufacturing and service costs.","In March, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%, principally due to volume as manufacturing costs are spread across a lower revenue base. Product mix expectations are roughly consistent with the December quarter.","Total operating expenses were $275 million in December and at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 39.1%. For the March quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $278 million at the midpoint, with variability around this level driven principally by the timing of program development costs.","Looking forward, our customers' technology road maps represent an opportunity for served market expansion for process control and market share opportunities for KLA.","Our operating expense investment levels for 2019 are geared to meet the needs of this expanding market for our products and technology. We are making significant investments to support EUV adoption, increasing metrology and inspection challenges in memory and data analytics and design-based capabilities to ensure customers are able to get increasing value from our products. We are optimistic about these growth prospects and plan to invest accordingly.","The effective tax rate was 11.4%. Given the new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, we are adjusting our long-term planning rate down 1% to 14%. At this point, we expect this rate to remain at 14%, inclusive of Orbotech after close of the transaction.","Finally, net income for the quarter was $372 million, and we had 152.6 million fully diluted weighted shares outstanding.","Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.7 billion, cash from operations was $282 million and free cash flow was $256 million. Capital expenditures for 2018 were higher than our historical run rate of around $50 million to $60 million per year due to the expansion of production facilities to support future growth as well as investment to support our new, R&D-focused facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan.","I would expect CapEx levels to remain elevated in calendar '19 as we continue to make investments in these areas. For calendar year '18, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 30%.","In the December quarter, we baked an aggregate of $115 million in regular and quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $250 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.","We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization with just over $400 million remaining as of the close of the quarter. We expect to complete this program over the next couple of quarters consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional $1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition.","In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA in the December quarter reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control on our customers' growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model.","Given these factors and coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the anticipated Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA is uniquely positioned to continue to deliver long-term value to stockholders.","After three strong years of memory investment, 2019 will be a year of digestion for this segment of the industry. Customers continue to press their technology road maps, but their capacity planning remains fluid.","For KLA, we expect that given our technology leadership, coupled with expected growth in the foundry and logic segments and along with our exposure to broader opportunities in the wafer and reticle markets, we are well positioned to outperform the industry in 2019.","With that, to summarize, guidance for the March quarter is: shipments in the range of $860 million to $940 million; revenue between $880 million and $960 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.35 to $1.67 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.39 to $1.71 per share. We plan to update guidance inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition shortly after completion of the transaction later this quarter.","Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to notify investors that we have decided to shift our 2019 New York Investor Day from the original planned date in March to later in the calendar year. We will update you on the new timing at a later date.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Theodore Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead, sir.","Timothy Arcuri","So Bren, I'm trying to sort of noodle through the pull-in and noodle through the impact of that. So if I adjust for the pull-in, the shipments were like $2.15 billion in the back half of 2018. And then if I adjust for that pull-in, the shipments would be like $965 million roughly at the midpoint for March.","You said before that the first half shipments would be up versus the back half. So for it to even be flat, that would imply that June shipments would have to be like $1.18 billion or something like that. So they'd have to be up a lot versus March. So I'm just wondering, have those two memory push-outs, do they push out beyond June such that the June shipments would not be $1.18 billion so that it would be what you said it was before?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Tim. So I think on your math, look, we had $65 million of shipment pull-ins into December quarter. So based on that guidance, yes, just that effect alone would move the number from $900 million to $965 million. The push-outs are pretty significant in terms of two major projects.","So I would say one pushed out further than the first half of the year. The other one, we'll see. I think that there are a number of projects where timing might be in the middle of the year. So we'll have to see where it ultimately lands. But clearly, it had a effect on our view.","First half now, I would expect to be down versus the second half of '18. And then we would see a recovery in the second half of '19. So down somewhere in and around 10% plus or minus is how I'm modeling it today, but we'll see how it plays out.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay. Got it. And then if I look back at the revenue, if I just take the midpoint of the revenue guidance, something like $920 million. And I look back at what you did when you were at $920 million in the past, margin was about 200 basis points higher than what you're guiding it. So can you maybe give a little information why is margin so low? Is it just mix? And do you get that back in June and throughout the rest of the year?","Bren Higgins","So Tim, I mean, we were obviously sizing the company. And as you can see our output from December in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range. So the decline in the second half of the year and then that carrying forward here through the first quarter is that we're taking basically a factory that's sized to ship a much higher level and spreading those costs across a smaller revenue base.","So the volume impact of that is pushing gross margins down, and that's really the only change from a quarter-to-quarter basis as you look at the different moving parts within margin.","So I would expect as we start to see revenue pickup given the guidance we said of sequential revenue growth through the rest of the calendar year, we'll start to see some incremental gross margin improvement there.","And based on the guidance that we were giving in terms of outperform relative to the industry based on where consensus WFE estimates likely are, we probably see gross margins somewhere in and around, I would say, 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points as I'm modeling the year.","We'll have to see how some of the mix dynamics play through. But obviously, we're in a much lower revenue level today. And with the industry contracting than what we saw in calendar '18, and that will have effect on our gross margin in the near term.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Ada for John. Can you discuss if you're seeing any changes in domestic China at this point?","Bren Higgins","Well, the domestic China is a little weaker versus the last call where we were thinking that shipments looked about flat for the indigenous projects year-to-year. As we look at that today, it's probably somewhere in the 10% to 15% lower. We'll see. Obviously, visibility in the second half is not so great at this point. But if I look at the shipment profile of what we shipped in '18, what we expect to ship in '19, it's about 10% to 15% lower, most of it around memory.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And can you talk about the implementation of EUV in DRAM and logic foundry and if you're seeing any changes to the adoption cadence given kind of the slow adoption of leading-edge nodes that's being discussed right now?","Richard Wallace","No real change. This is Rick. In terms of the rate of adoption, we see continued piloting in early development with an intent to ramp. And we're participating in that through some of the development work we do and also in the mask shop some of our demand has been driven by that. But no real change in the cadence of what we've seen in the past.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Your line is open. From Cowen, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Steve calling in behalf of Krish. The first one I wanted to ask about was on your bare wafer inspection tool business. Just given how strong that business has been performing for a while now and just given some of the moderation in wafer starts in the semi industry, how should we think about the trajectory of that business across the rest of this year?","Bren Higgins","Yes. So this is Bren. So that business continues to show very strong momentum. You have to keep in mind that there are a number of things that are happening there. First of all, there was a long period of time without any investment really at all. So there's a change in the capacity requirements there that customers have been investing in.","That, coupled with spec changes, have driven not just the inspection tools, but also need for the metrology tools. So we've seen that business perform very well through '18 and would expect as we look at '19 not much change from that business.","So I would expect to see it carry forward. And based on communications so far with customers, I don't have any reason to change that assessment.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Got it. And as for my follow-up, wanted to ask about the relative trend or profile of foundry and logic demand across this year. Is that going to be more first half weighted followed by a moderation in the back half when, I assume, memory picks up the demand profile or do you also see foundry and logic relatively steady across the year? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","In some of the prepared remarks, we talked about it being reasonably balanced across the halves. So I think second half could be a little bit larger, but generally pretty reasonably balanced for both logic and foundry as you add the two segments together.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.","C.J. Muse","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the deferred revenue side, it was a nice uptick for September, but looks like very modest impact here in December. So I guess first question, do you think that the volatility associated with deferred revenues is now behind us?","Bren Higgins","Yes, C.J., I think it is. It wasn't that big of an issue for us. But certainly, we're seeing revenue much closer to shipment as you saw from the results in the December quarter and the guidance for March. And if you look in the 10-Q filing, you see the reconciliation between 605 and 606, effectively the same results quarter-to-quarter.","So there was the timing issues that played out. But at the end of the day, I think the right way to think about the business and model it given that these are really timing dynamics is pretty much the shipment number will be the revenue number with some variation related to new products.","Now we do ship more new products maybe than some of the peers and so that can have an effect or certain regions where you may have to go all the way to customer acceptance. But generally, the numbers are going to be pretty close together.","C.J. Muse","Okay. That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, as you think about the progression of EUV and thinking specifically to foundry, can you speak to what's driving the demand here, 7-nanometer versus 5-nanometer and how you see the revenue kind of progression through calendar '19 and into calendar '20?","Richard Wallace","I'm sorry, C.J., what's driving the demand from the device standpoint or for us?","C.J. Muse","I'm trying to understand your demand side, both from a more modest pilot line 7-nanometer plus activity this year, ramping more aggressively to 5 next year.","Richard Wallace","Yes, sure. It's pretty straightforward actually. Most of the demand early in the 7-nanometer comes out of the mask shop because that's where people are qual-ing new mask sets and driving a lot of utilization of new capability in the mask shop. And also in the development phases of trying to get those devices to work.","And then it'll shift toward production and it will drive more in line kind of applications, both inspection and also some of the metrology needs as we ramp. But right now, what we're experiencing is mainly in the mask shop and the development.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Maybe, Rick, as a follow-up to C.J.'s EUV question. From your delivery perspective, has everything generally remained on track or do you see any potential pull-ins or push-outs in terms of the timing of delivery of your reticle inspection tools?","Richard Wallace","No, nothing has delayed. If anything, throughout calendar '18, we saw accelerated demand in support of a larger number of starts than we would have forecast for a year ago in terms of advanced design. So far more tapeouts of advanced designs, both for EUV, but also just advanced 7-nanometer without EUV.","So we're seeing the demand on both of those. We don't have an EUV-specific tool in the market. We have tools that can cover both. So we're pretty well situated to support it either way. But that's been strong and particularly in the foundry logic area.","Patrick Ho","Great. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question in the DRAM market. We've seen how, I think, in the past you've talked about an increase in metrology usage with 3D NAND. As the DRAM industry goes to 1Y and eventually to 1Z and with increases in patterning steps, how do you see the mix of an increase in process control intensity?","Is it going to be more biased towards your inspection tools because of the patterning steps or are you also seeing more metrology applications come online as the DRAM industry migrates down these next few nodes?","Richard Wallace","Yes. Some of both, but for sure, the DRAM will push inspection, high-level inspection sensitivity because they're more sensitive than, say, a NAND flash would be towards advanced inspection capability for smaller defects. So definitely, DRAM is going to push it in terms of things like our Gen 5.","Metrology, both of metrology more so I think the flatness and cleanliness on wafers for NAND has been a driver we've talked about in the past. So it then moves when you got a DRAM back to overlay constraint.","So it really depends. Fortunately, for us, there are different problems that kind of push different parts of the portfolio depending on where they are in the cycle.","Patrick Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe focusing on products. On your flagship Gen 5 PWI inspection system, can you guys just true us up here? I know the team was anticipating 17 to 18 systems in the field exiting last year. Did you guys hit that target?","And more importantly, sort of given the ramp of EUV, the early work on 5 and 7-nanometer logic, one alpha node for DRAM, what are your thoughts around growth of Gen 5 this calendar year?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Harlan, it's Bren. So thanks for the question. So yes, we did hit our target. Expectations were very consistent or results were consistent with expectations for that product. And as we move into next year, we're still seeing a steady cadence of investment here. Most of the tools are development-focused.","We're introducing the second iteration of the product line that provides more, a better cost of ownership for customers, slightly better throughput and also has some new features with data analytics, computational capability, design-based capabilities and so on.","So it is moving along pretty well, should be deployed. We'll start to see it crossover. I don't know exactly what the crossover percent will look like in '19. But as you start to think about 5-nanometer ramps, you'll start to see more Gen 5 deployed in production.","Harlan Sur","Yes. Okay. Good to see the momentum there. And then can you guys just give us an update on your multicolumn e-beam inspector system for sub 7-nanometer mask inspection? Last time you gave us an update, which was about a year ago, I think the team was on track to introduce systems this calendar year, calendar year '19. Can we get an update and any early metrics on performance, throughput or customer feedback?","Richard Wallace","Customer interest remains high. We are now on a phase of this program where because we're engaged in developments with specific customers, we're not talking publicly about progress.","But I can tell you there's a lot of interest, a lot of demand out there for capability as you've seen the increase in EUV capability and implementation. But we're not in a position right now to go through the specifics of where we're going based on the collaborations we have.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions. At this time, I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Theodore Lockwood","Thank you, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours.","Theodore Lockwood","Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Wallace","Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call. Q4 was another solid quarter for KLA with results finishing above the midpoint of guidance demonstrating the company is benefiting from our strategies for growth in market leadership while delivering strong relative performance in a challenging year for the industry.","I'd like to provide some insights into today's equipment demand environment. Even with the signs of stabilization and NAND pricing, DRAM continues to be weak and the business environment in memory is soft. This has resulted in broad based low levels of investment as customers have idled existing capacity and delayed new capacity plans as they focus on rebalancing supply and demand. The weakness in memory is being offset by rising demand from foundry and logic, which are traditionally strong markets for KLA.","The business environment in foundry and logic is expected to continue to be strong through the second half of 2019 and into 2020, driven by next-generation technology development, capacity additions at the leading-edge, increasing competitive dynamics, and investment in EUV infrastructure. Altogether our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 remains consistent with the initial view we held in January, with demand expected to decline by approximately 20% in the year and with a significant shift in product mix to foundry and logic.","Now I'd like to update you on some recent product highlights from our semiconductor process control business. KLA's market leadership is enabled by successful execution of a portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're very pleased with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we're experiencing across our portfolio.","For example, we are currently seeing accelerated adoption of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, which is now in its second iteration since first being produced in 2016. We expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 compared to the previous year. Customers are leveraging the combination of sensitivity and throughput in this platform to enable unique detection of yield limiting defects at significantly lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives.","The strong customer adoption of Gen 5 and the continued success of the Gen 4 platform, now in its fifth iteration, are further confirmation of the success of our multi-generation platform strategy for innovation and market leadership in optical inspection. Further, the latest generation of our laser scattering optical inspection platform, known as Voyager, is also enjoying strong adoption in the marketplace. Leading memory and foundry customers are deploying Voyager for in-line monitoring application in high-volume manufacturing.","In mask inspection, the strong momentum which we have experienced over the past several quarters continues and is positioned to extend through 2020. We are seeing upside from leading foundries for our latest generation mask inspection platform and expect demand to broaden as customers move ahead with our EUV deployment strategies.","In metrology as WFE is transitioning more toward logic and foundry, we're seeing strong adoption of the new film and CD platforms released last year as our customers ramp complex technology architectures like finFET, new materials and new metal interconnects. And with the recent acquisition of Orbotech, we are further diversifying our business, broadening our product portfolio and growth opportunities and serving a larger market.","Integration and synergy activities are now well underway and we're very excited about the growth opportunities in combination with Orbotech. We look forward to further discussions on this in our upcoming Investor Day in September.","In summary, despite uncertainty in the current industry demand environment, momentum is building for KLA driven by strength in our semiconductor process control business and contributions from the recent acquisition of Orbotech. As a result, we are on a path for strong relative performance in 2019 while we continue to drive innovation and introduce differentiated products and solutions to serve the market when growth re-accelerates.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the Q2 financial results. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks Rick, and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue in Q2 was 1.258 billion and above the midpoint of range of guidance. GAAP earnings per share was $1.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78 each finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Total shipments were $1.354 billion approximately $79 million over the midpoint and exceeding the high end of the range or guidance for the quarter. Semiconductor process control shipments were approximately $1.080 billion.","We are pleased with the results we achieved in the June quarter despite significant noise and uncertainty in the global electronics market. As we continue to focus on executing our business across all markets, and move forward with our integration and synergy plans from the Orbotech acquisition.","Beginning this quarter, we will report our results under the new segment reporting structure that we adopted subsequent to the completion of the Orbotech acquisition and you will see this reflected in our Form 10-K when it is filed. Under this new structure we will report the KLA process control business in the semiconductor process control segment and will separate the former Orbotech businesses into two segments; specialty semiconductor process and PCB display and component inspection. The latter segment now includes the former ICOS component inspection business of KLA.","We believe this new segment reporting structure best reflects how our business is organized and the unique characteristics of each segment in terms of channels, markets, and technology. Results from the applicable services components will also be included within each segment. In addition, the June quarter will the last quarter we report shipments in our earnings call and we will no longer provide shipment guidance going forward.","As explained in detail on the earnings call last May, under ASC 606 revenue recognition, the overall timing of revenue shifts forward and as a result, the difference between shipments and revenue is immaterial and does not warrant the resource commitment to maintain dual reporting. Subsequently, investors can assume a close approximation of shipments to reported revenue in any given quarter.","Now, for the June quarter results, as I mentioned total revenue in the fourth quarter [ph] were $1.258 billion. We expect total revenue to grow about 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion in the September quarter. And for the second half revenue level to be higher than the first half with continued sequential growth expected in the December quarter across all our business segments.","I'll now turn to some detail and commentary regarding segment revenue trends in the June quarter. For the semiconductor process control segment, which as stated represents all legacy KLA, except our component inspection business, revenue was $1.003 billion in the quarter. component inspection revenue was just over [indiscernible]. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 remains mostly consistent with our original view from January with KLA benefiting from stronger foundry and logic demand.","I will note that on the margin over the past six months, although review of the overall demand environment in 2019 is unchanged, the near-term outlook for foundry and logic investment has improved offset by declines in memory. In fact, over the course of the June quarter we've seen our overall second half expectations improve modestly. Our current view for the semiconductor process control businesses is for the second half revenue to be up in the low double-digits versus first half of the calendar year as we now expect revenue from foundry and logic customers to be up over 35% versus the first half.","Memory investment remains weak and directed towards technology migration only. Memory was approximately 51% as semiconductor process control systems shipments in June and we expect memory to be approximately 42% of system revenue in the September quarter. Foundry was 35% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 44% of system revenue in Q3 [ph]. Shipments from logic customers were 14% and the current outlook is for logic revenue to be approximately flat in September.","Turning now to discussion of the semiconductor process segment, the former SPTS division at Orbotech. SPTS is a leader in PVD and etch solutions in fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices, as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $67 million.","June quarter results for this business were impacted meaningfully by the U.S. Department of Commerce ban on shipments of RF and MEMS semiconductors to Huawei as customers with Huawei market share delayed planned capacity investments. As the leader in etch and deposition tools for these markets, SPTS saw a delay in a portion of its expected business due to this ban. Though the longer term implications of this action are not clear, notwithstanding this issue, SPTS is still expected to deliver year-over-year pro forma revenue growth in calendar year 2019.","Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $185 million. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's ICOS component inspection business. Results for this segment were in line with our expectations for the quarter and are on track with our plans for this year.","Now I'll discuss the distribution of revenue by major product category in Q2. Wafer inspection was 32%. Patterning and which includes reticle inspection was 23%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the semiconductor process control segment. PCB display and component inspection revenue was 10% and specialty semiconductor processes 4%. Other, which includes solar, instruments, and the KLA pro mature products enhancements business was 4%. Service was 27% of revenue in the June quarter.","In terms of regional split of revenue, China was 32%, Taiwan was 25%, the U.S. was 15%, Japan was 10%, Korea was 8%, Europe was 6% and rest of Asia was 4%.","Now for more detail on the results and the P&L. Gross margin was 58.9% in June at the top end of the guided range for the quarter of 58% to 59% as a higher level of semi process control revenue offset the Huawei effect on our specialty semiconductor business. We expect gross margin in the September quarter to be in the range of 60% to 61% as the more favorable product mix in our semi process control business and higher expected service margins drive gross margin improvement in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we believe there are many opportunities for us to improve the Orbotech gross margin profile across the businesses by leveraging our global supply chain, service infrastructure and global footprint. We will discuss these initiatives in more detail over the coming quarters as we get a firm picture on the timing and financial impact of these actions.","Total operating expenses were $370 million in June below the guided $375 million target due to lower than expected expenses across the business and some synergy benefit from Orbotech. Operating margin was 29.5%. We expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019 consistent with the timing of our planned product development investments and the realization of initial synergy activities. Other income and expense in the June quarter was $38 million and we expect OIE [ph] to be approximately $36 million this quarter.","The effective tax rate was 13.7% and going forward investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at the 40% level given a new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit. Net income was $289 million and we had 162 diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","Now for some highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.7 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. Cash from operations were $325 million and free cash flow was $270 million. We are making infrastructure investments to support our future growth, including the construction of a new building in our Milpitas Headquarter site, and a new facility in Ann Arbor Michigan. We expect annual capital expenditures to exceed [indiscernible] over the next few years due to these projects and other infrastructure investments necessary to sustain our future growth expectations.","In the June quarter we've made an aggregate of $121 million in regular quarterly dividend and dividend equivalents upon vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $345 million of common stock at an average share price of just below $112 per share pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $900 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. For September we expect fully diluted share count of between 159 million and 160 million shares.","In conclusion, the June quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance with our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across our broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019 and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in our business.","With that, to summarize, guidance for the third quarter [ph] is revenue between $1.31 billion and $1.39 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 a share to $2.34 per share.","Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to remind investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We look forward to seeing you there.","I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Theodore Lockwood","Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A we request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please feel free to requeue if you have any additional questions, which we will accommodate as time permits. Jerome, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You are now live.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. I appreciate letting me ask questions, congratulation on the solid results. Rick, it's good to see foundry and logic performing strongly in the calendar second half's expectation that continues into 2020, I'd be kind of curious, as you look at the memory market and differentiate between NAND, DRAM and maybe process control and bare wafer, how do you think that market plays out in the back half of year, which quarter do you think it bottoms in and how do you think about the recovery potential in 2020?","Rick Wallace","I'll give you some thoughts and then let Bren weigh in. Right now we don\u2019t see, as we said, we don\u2019t see a lot of momentum in DRAM. I think what we've got now is some strengthening I think we think in the foundry and logic as we said, but not a lot other than technology migration and not a lot of capacity. So if you think about when the recovery might come for NAND probably first half of 2020 and DRAM what our customers are saying now is more mid 2020 timeframe before we would see any meaningful change.","Bren Higgins","Yes, John, I would say that I'd characterize the market as what we're most is seeing the technology migration investment only and one thing about KLA is since we do help our customers navigate their roadmap transitions we are seeing some level of business from some of these customers. There is also some activity in China. We saw some last quarter shift influenced our shipments and we expect to see some more in the second half of the year.","But to Rick's point, I think as we look at the overall market I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any meaningful capacity as until we get into 2020. And given that customers have been disciplined and pushing out capacity they have been idling capacity. How quickly that comes back is a little early to tell from this point.","You mentioned bare wafer, on the bare wafer side we see our business at bare wafer being roughly flat into the second half of 2019. Now 2019 overall for that business is lower than it was in 2018. We had a huge inflection in 2018. We've seen it come off a bit in 2019, it probably comes off a little bit in 2020.","I think we're operating that at a more sustainable or higher level for that business moving forward given the dynamics around memory, around specifications both for inspection, but also from metrology. So, and the numbers that we provided in the commentary I think that's been part of our view in terms of expectations moving forward. So I wouldn\u2019t say that much has changed there and that's certainly we've been pretty open about.","John Pitzer","Well that all, I got it. And maybe as my followup, Rick I'd love to get your comments on just inspection and process control intensity in foundry and logic as you move to 7 and then 5 and I guess it's kind of a complex equation. How does EUV going to fit you guys in the business going forward?","Rick Wallace","Sure, John. I think a couple of things, one we mentioned the strength in Gen 5 and a lot of that is driven, of course logic is going to drive that harder than we're seeing that transition from Gen 4 to Gen 5 in terms of the bulk of our system. So the design will shrink. We're going to drive smaller deep activity requirements driving toward the Gen 5.","The other thing that's happening is overlay is a big driver for us in terms of the additional pressure put on our customers as they drive advanced design rolls. Eventually we're seeing that in a couple of ways. One, we're seeing it in our shop with the number of starts, pre-EUV but also the anticipated large number of EUV, but also the print down checks, because I think what's really going to happen for a while as people are going to want to verify the designs, so another use for Gen 5.","So overall, we think there is going to be an increase in process control intensity as we introduce EUV I think that that's more in the development phase. Longer term I think it levels out a bit as we get into high volume production later. But right now definitely the mix is favorable to us in terms of what we're seeing. We also mentioned increased competition in foundry and that's also been a driver I think to the mixed shift overall.","John Pitzer","Thanks and congratulations.","Rick Wallace","Thanks John.","Bren Higgins","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. You are now live.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarterly execution and strong outlook. In terms of the strong results and outlook, specifically within your mask or reticle inspection business, EUV system shipments, looks like they are going to grow about 70% this year.","If I look into next year, the installed EUV base is still growing about 50% to 60%. So given your guide is very high market share at the of mash ups how do you see your mash up inspection business directionally and do you guys already have visibility into the directionality of this segment next year just given the long lead times and continued growth of the installed base?","Bren Higgins","Yes Harlan, it's Bren and I'll go first here, but if you look at the reticle inspection business couple of things are driving it. First, significant tape-out in the foundry at 7 nanometer and so that's driving significant purchasing of the product. You have to remember that reticle inspection in a mash up behaved somewhat to process, when you are inspecting every reticle before you ship it to the fab. So it has some unique dynamics in terms of how customers buy relative to the design starts and they move together. That's one dynamic and that's driving the business.","The other obviously is the EUV development activity that's also driving the Teron system. So you have both effects, but frankly the biggest driver today is more around the design start at 7 and it is driving that business to have nice solid growth in the year obviously where WFE is down. So we're seeing growth in that and as Rick said in his prepared remarks, we would expect that to continue into 2020.","Timing of the EUV deployment and how we see that plays out next year, it will potential influence some of the upgrades to the existing install base out there, but there is some sustainability in the business and we're seeing a nice recovery in it. And then we'll see that next generation products as they come out as we move into the second half of next year to support EUV directly. So there's a lot of exciting things happening in that space and we're seeing the numbers flow through in terms of P&L impact.","Rick Wallace","I think just to build on one aspect of it, I think the fact that we have extended the Teron platform to be able to handle these EUV layers, yes we benefit whether or not depending on the number of EUV layers, we still benefit because we've got an optical platform that can handle either the mask for EUV or for traditional lithography. So I think that's a part of why we're benefiting more depending on the starts and just the intensity of the advanced nodes, not necessarily just on the EUV because it's still not clear how many layers and at what nodes they are going to be adopted, but we're seeing strength in reticle regardless of which way that goes.","Harlan Sur","All right, thanks for the insights there. And then you guys were thinking 90 days ago that there was an upward bias for the Orbotech business moving into the second half of the year, but just given all of the China trade overhang, given that Orbotech has a number of large customers, do you guys still see the second half of this will be better for the Orbotech team and if so, maybe a bit of color on what segments are improving in the second half? I mean I would assume that specialty semi is doing well just given the strong focus on RF and power, but what about FPV and PCB?","Bren Higgins","Yes, so growth expectations for specialty semi have come down a bit for this year directly related to the Huawei effect. The indirect effect, but you do have customers in the RF space that have market share with Huawei phones and so they've more cautious and in some of their plans for capacity and that's impacted that business.","So that business is still going to grow year-over-year, but probably not to the degree that that we expected 90 days ago before the ban came out. I would say PCB and flat panel, are in line with our expectations, PCB flattish, flat panels down this year, but most of the growth for the business is going to come from specialty semi. So there's still some growth there year-to-year, but but a little bit less given the Huawei effect.","Rick Wallace","Yes. But just to put it in perspective Harlan, we're still within a few percentage of what we had originally modeled in terms of profitability and contribution to KLA for the business. So it still looks good. As Bren said, some kind of shifting dynamics, so not really that different from what we thought earlier in the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, great job on the execution. Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You are now live.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I guess the first question Rick is that, there have been some other companies in your broader sector that the past couple of weeks have talked about, some pull-ins from China that are sort of helping the back half of the year. And I know you talked last quarter about a big project that was out of the second half and now is sort of back in the second half, but what are you seeing generally in China? I guess, is it your view that the trade stuff only increases the pace of these projects as you kind of look into the back half of the year and into next year?","Rick Wallace","We have definitely seen some puts and takes in China to the point, but we're seeing what others are seeing, where so maybe increased urgency in terms of the second half to get those projects fully up and as you know, there's just a lot of noise in the system. In terms of what effects might come in. The only substantial thing we've seen is a very small part of our business as Bren mentioned, but overall, pretty much where we thought in terms of the second half having some strength in it.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I think the DRAM project, I mean it's interesting at that start beginning of the year, we thought it was completely out and wow it looks like we'll see it ship in the second half of the year. We're seeing to Rick's point some puts and takes related to some of the wafer plants in China. So overall I would say our expectations for China business this year versus where we thought are probably on the margin, slightly higher than where we were before, but not a lot of change there overall.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay Bren, thanks. And then I guess is the second question, I'm wondering if you can quantify in the spec SMEs segment how much the sort of indirect Huawei there, is it something like $10 million to $20 million a quarter, is that what it's costing you sort of into the back half of the year? I'm just sort of trying to baseline what the business would look like if this ban had not, or is not in effect?","Bren Higgins","Yes, so Tim, I think in the immediate quarter and you'll see some adjustments to plan meet the quarter, the impact was between $20 million and 25 million and certainly some of the strength in other parts of our business helped us achieve our results for the quarter. That number probably goes up to the $35 million-ish plus or minus as we move into the second half of the year in terms of our expectations. In total, so probably somewhere around $35 million to $40 million impact on calendar 2019.","In the long run, it's interesting as those, as other providers that are non-U.S. providers start to ramp their capacity that creates an opportunity for the specialty semiconductor business there. So in the long run, and they are in an inferior position, so in the long run there potentially a big opportunity out there in terms of how the designing around the supply chain works. But in terms of the current year, the impact is probably somewhere between $35 million and $40 million in total.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, guys, awesome. Thank you so much","Rick Wallace","Jerome, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. You are now live.","Krish Sankar","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. First one for Rick or Bren, I know you guys have not given out your guidance, but if I look at some of the commentary you made in terms of strength of foundry lasting into first half of '20 and NAND in first half and maybe DRAM in the second half of '20 recovering, is it fair to assume that your legacy KLA, the business is going to be up in calendar '20 versus calendar '19 and if so, what is the risk to that guesstimate? And then I had a follow-up.","Rick Wallace","Yes, so let me take the first part and then give it to Bren. So we're not going to call it legacy. It's a process control business now that we have other businesses and the trajectory is good. We're going to get into more discussion of the outlook at our Analyst Day next month, but definitely, we feel like things are coming our way in terms of the right kind of market momentum, the advanced design rule work that's going on. In addition, some of the competitive dynamics, we talked about Gen 5 strengthening and some new projects, new products hitting the market. So we feel very good about overall position and Bren can talk in broader terms.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I think we feel pretty good about logic, foundry and sustainability of spend levels into 2020. So I think if you look across those end markets and you look at the activity there. We would expect to see continued investment. We talked about competitive dynamics, the strength of the 7 nanometer node out there is also limiting how much reuse customers can do, and so that's certainly having an effect as well. You'll see automotive and industrial hopefully start to come back next year and so as you think about the broader demand across all of logic, foundry, I think there are a number of drivers that give us some confidence moving into next year about those segments.","Krish Sankar","Got it, okay. And then as a follow-up, you guys, introduce a new e-beam wafer defect review product recently and I'm kind of curious, how do we think about the coexistence of Gen 5 and e-beam down the road for your product portfolio and is this e-beam kind of just targeted towards specialized applications, so just kind of curious on how to think about the lay of the land for your products? Thank you.","Rick Wallace","Well, I think what we said all along is we think there is a complementary role for optical and e-beam and this continues that. I think that what we have in our latest technology is a very capable e-beam tool that when our customers utilize with our advanced optical they really get the best of both in terms of capabilities for the market. But I don't think there will ever be a day where there is not a complementary e-beam solution with optical.","Optical keeps getting better, e-beam has to get better too, but I think the general mix between e-beam and optical will remain about the same in terms of the way customers spend their dollars. But we're very excited about what we've seen in the market and we think the synergy of having our optical tool, coupled with our e-beam is really great for our customers trying to solve some of their very challenging problems.","Krish Sankar","Thanks Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. You are now live.","C.J. Muse","Great, thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to follow up on that last question regarding your expectations for sustainability of foundry, strength to continue through 2020. I guess within that could you speak to, I guess both your positioning within Gen 5 EUV, e-beam, perhaps new products that you haven't announced yet, but you just highlighted? And then also from an end market perspective in terms of rising competition as you look at Samsung coming in, we'd love to hear, I guess in more detail your thoughts on that front?","Rick Wallace","Yes. So, this is Rick. I'll talk more sentiment than actual numbers in terms of 2020 because we really don't know, but you can always to higher customer is behaving and what the mood is in the market. And right now we're actually in a situation where we see a lot of energy around our customers pushing for new capability, pushing for getting their advanced designs out, you see a lot of tape-outs, the mask business has been good, so definitely feel strong.","The other thing and not to be missed, what Bren mentioned is, we don't see a lot of reuse happening because of some of the challenges of the new technologies. So that was something that we were trying to really map out and see what it was going to look like and the combination of new capability on our side, new challenges on our customer side, make us feel like it looks very strong in terms of the momentum.","How long into '20, we don't really have great visibility into that. It's just now we have a case where you've got multiple players really concerned about bringing out new technology and ramping new devices, and at the same time we're hitting with some products that are new to the market and very exciting for us.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful, thank you. As my follow-up, could you I guess speak a little bit to your expectations for growth in the service bucket, both for process control as well as for overall Orbotech?","Bren Higgins","Yes, CJ, so in process control for those process control customers we believe we have a long-term trajectory somewhere in that 9% to 10% CAGR opportunity over time. We're adding tools to the installed base at a much faster rate than they're coming off, so that creates opportunities for us. 75% of that revenue stream is contract based because of customers desire to keep those tools up and how they buy process control also just a general complexity of what we sell. So that's good for that business. We've seen it slow a little bit in the near term related to just some of the idling of capacity that's well understood in the market. But over the long run we've seen it grow at that rate and we expect it to continue to grow like at that rate over time.","The PCB business for Orbotech it has a strong service profile, say 95% of the tools are under contract, so of the PCB revenue we reported about 40% of it is service stream. So because of the imaging technology and the need for that tool as enabling for circuit boards, that's a positive trend for that business.","I think on the flat panel side, there is very little service activity in terms of some consumable parts that are attractive, but there is some opportunity there for us certainly. And on specialty semiconductors, as we think about how we try to leverage our position in working with customers to offer better solutions over time there might be an opportunity for us to help customers that way on the specialty side.","Smaller companies always have a harder time with service just the broader footprint. So maybe what we end up doing is enabling a better cost position for both flat panel and for specialty semi, but a lot of opportunity for us moving forward I think in terms of driving that straightforward for the company.","C.J. Muse","Thanks, Bren.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You are now live.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. First on gross margins, so you're guiding gross margins up 160 basis points or so, 60% or 61%, what's driving that and should we expect margins to continue to expand as your sales potentially grow again in December?","Bren Higgins","Well, as I said last quarter, I thought there were some unique effects affecting the June quarter from an overall mix perspective in our semi-process control business. Not all our products carry the same margin and under 606 it's whatever you ship is ultimately what you revenue. So some of that was a bit dilutive to our margins, drove the margins down to the almost just short of 59%. Moving forward, obviously we have some growth in revenue and that's helpful.","We're seeing a reversion sort of back to a normalized mix on the process control side and I'm expecting to see stronger and higher utilization rates out of the service business in some higher margins in the service overall. So all those are driving us into the 60% to 61% range and I would expect to see that as we move into next quarter as well. So a normalizing effect that I telegraphed last quarter off of the June number, and it seems like that's where we expect to see the overall as we move into the next six months or so.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And for my follow-up. Rick, I'm curious how resilient has your core process control services business been in this cyclical downturn versus what do you assume what went well what did not go as well. Every time we get into a downturn, we always hope for the resilience of that business, but I'm just curious as you look back, how resilient it actually was over the last several quarters?","Rick Wallace","Yes, sure. It was pretty resilient. I think that as Bren mentioned, there was a little bit of softening we saw, but overall, we still see healthy growth rate. It was a little bit under what's been modeled for the long term, but we actually think we'll catch back up with that long-term modeling for a lot of reasons. I mean, I think that the utilization on some of the fabs has obviously been decreased, but there the service base is so large now and there's a lot of value in keeping those tools up and running. So we feel pretty good about it. Still, and I think the slowest quarter was still in load upper single digits, so pretty good about 8%.","Bren Higgins","Yes. Back in the worst downturn we've ever had, I mean it's always held up pretty well. Right? And it's, I think the other thing about that business for us is it's bigger now right? And it's growing faster than the systems business. So bigger is the percent of the total, so a solid anchor with we believe an earnings stream that's accretive to the overall.","So, I think the dynamics are intact. It goes to the points earlier about how customers buy service that they need the tools up, they need matching performance, there's general complexity that's hard to deal with and for all those reasons, they tend to rely on us and want a contract stream to ensure the uptime of those products and even in difficult environments they still tend to run the tools and there is a certain amount of business that is there for us.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. You are now live.","Joe Quatrochi","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the gross margin puts and takes for some of the new products that you launched last month. Can you just help us or remind us how we should think about this gross margins ramping over time.","Bren Higgins","Yes, you know, Joe, it's something we've been talking about. I mean, anytime, and it really goes back to how we introduced products at KLA. Typically when we're bringing products out into the market our focus is on use case validation and driving applications and adoption. And so, we usually come out with a product, we're trying to prove it out, and the margins typically are a little bit lower than what I would say the mature iteration of the previous platform. Then the engineering team starts to design for cost, we start to look at ways to second source.","And as we introduce new subsequent iterations to the product that the margin profile improves. So, any time we have a new one come out, it is a little bit lower and then over time it catches back up. So it did have an effect on the margin profile as I mentioned in the prior quarters and I think we'll see that play out as we move over the rest of this year and into next year. With a big portfolio like we have, we tend to see some products where there are different stages of that maturity cycle, so they tend to offset each other.","But, generally, part of what we do at KLA is ensure the value of what we deliver to customers in terms of how we price and discipline around that. So we ensure that what we are able to deliver product-by-product is pretty consistent and usually over time, we're able to drive more and more value out of it and I would say that we're not any different today with the latest round of products.","Joe Quatrochi","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the e-beam side I was just curious if you could share any kind of early customer feedback that you've gotten so far, maybe how should we think about the initial ramp for adoption of that solution?","Rick Wallace","The industrial feedback and we're still, we're out in a number of sites and we're getting feedback and we're doing demos, feedback is good. We're not ready to start modeling it into the numbers yet, because it does take a while to get the adoption of these platforms going, but we feel pretty good about the technical capability and the production worthiness. It does as I say, take a little while for customers to adopt enough to contribute meaningfully when we're at a $5 billion run rate.","Bren Higgins","Yes, I would say the portfolio approach that we have these products fit with the portfolio. You've got common capabilities across the tools, common algorithms, common other options and that help drive out - incremental performance out of the inspectors. So with the review or even baseline ground truth reference tools it helps sort of enable the broader franchise. So that's the approach we've taken at KLA, it matters more than ever today with the challenges in the production process, the size of the defects, the noise that happens on the wafer. So across all of that, having those capabilities that independently are tough to sometimes markets aren't always all that big, but collectively across the portfolio, create a lot of value for our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. You are now live.","Quinn Bolton","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the nice results and outlook. I'm really just wondering, you mentioned the strength on the Gen 5 tool, you guys introduce the fifth iteration of Gen 4 last month, just wondering what demand you're seeing for the older Gen 4 systems as Gen 5 ramps?","Rick Wallace","Well, it's, think of it like a lithography mix and match. So what you get is, you end up with customers deploying the most cost effective solution they can that has the capability that they need and that really cascades starting with e-beam, then getting to 39xx than 29xx, and then the new Voyager platform. So it's really - the easier layers are harder than they used to be on the advanced node. So customers will deploy where they can the Gen 4 and then they'll put Gen 5 up against the problems when that's the only way to really solve them. Did that answer your question?","Quinn Bolton","That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the China question, you referenced some puts and takes, but generally, perhaps a strengthening in that market versus 90 days ago. Do you have any sense as to the demand strength, I mean you're seeing more of a timing shift where projects are getting pulled in or do you think that this is just an acceleration in the roadmap for some of those indigenous Chinese fabs? Thanks.","Rick Wallace","I don't think it's as much about, - I think what happens is, there is uncertainty may be about their own plans and their ability to procure tools. So that may be pushed it out and then when they realized they could do it, pulled it back in. I don't want to speak for them, but I think it's more that the projects getting solidified. And I think 90 days ago maybe that was more on par is to see if they can even get the tool sets. So that's kind of where we are. It's not so much about end demand. I don't think as them staying on some of their plans. And by the way, there are a lot more programs there that we already derated. If you go back a couple of years ago and had listened to what customers have said, we're getting closer and closer to what we anticipated for 2019 and a going run rate for 2020.","Quinn Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You are now live.","Sidney Ho","Thank you. If you look at the capacity build for the upcoming 5 nanometers, how do you think the rate at which the capacity is being built is compared to previous, now let's say, to 7 nanometer or 10 nanometers? Wafer that the pilot line for 5 nanometers, could be little bit bigger than in the past, but just want to hear from your perspective of what is driving that kind of changes?","Bren Higgins","Yes, I think that, and I'll go first here. I mean, we are seeing a little bit stronger adoption level and to the point earlier, you're seeing less migration of other tools from previous nodes, and so that's driving a certain amount of activity. I would expect it will probably be somewhere between 80 and 90 k wafer starts and for 5 nanometers get into that sort of through the first part of 2020 or maybe that's towards the end of 2020. So I would say that because of some of those other dynamics related to 7 we're seeing perhaps more activity for us on the 5 nanometer node.","Sidney Ho","Okay, maybe. And then my follow-up question is on the China strength that you guys expect in the second half. It seems that you guys talk about the DRAM project being pulled in, but my understanding is that, is that true that a lot of that revenue you have already seen it, because it seems like they have gone, most of those customers have gone past the initial yield improvement stage and from here on out, it's more on the production level type of run rate?","Bren Higgins","Well, like I said, I mean there some puts and takes in the overall level of business in China. I think it's slightly better than what we thought before, but there is some rationalization of wafer capacity that's happening likely as well. So, while you do have some strength around this because DRAM project, you do have some other moving parts. I think the way to think about this business is more about proving out technology roadmaps and then moving on to the next node.","So there is some amount of capacity that gets added, but then there is a lot of effort to progress down the technology roadmap, and because of that we're seeing more engagement than you otherwise might, because yes yields are slightly improving on the trailing node that they happen to move to the next node, then they are challenged again and need to upgrade certain parts of the tool set.","So that's driving a more continuous level of business, not just with this customer, but with other customers. And you might see when you're at some node and then go ramp it to significant volume production as and you'd see in one of the leading-edge memory fabs. It's a little different behavior smaller fabs and more of a focus on trying to move down the technology curve than then just ramping a lot of capacity.","Sidney Ho","All right, that's helpful, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. He will now. Your line is now live","Brian Chin","Good afternoon, this is Brian Chin on for Patrick. Thanks for allowing us ask a few questions. Maybe a few questions on the PCB and flat panel markets, PCB first, the overlay of Huawei might also cloud things a little bit here, but of the major Smartphone ecosystems, it sounds like China has been a laggard in terms of adoption of [indiscernible] line space SLP and SAP manufacturing. So have you begun to see the China leader or leaders begin to adopt to the Orbotech, or now KLA, imaging products this year or are we still earlier on this adoption curve for them as we - and maybe you'll see that more as we move into next year?","Rick Wallace","Yes, it's still not yet. I think we do expect that to see that and the current expectation is, as you say it's probably next year, probably the third guys to do that.","Brian Chin","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe pivoting to the flat panel, from an early planning perspective, obviously a week spending year environment this year, but do you see any lead indicators, early indicators through for your product lines, like the AI [ph] tool that suggests we could see a meaningful pickup in the spending environment come next year and if you do, does this increase your urgency to pull in some of the cost synergies relative for that 24-month horizon?","Rick Wallace","We don't, right. It's too early for us right now to see 2020 picking up. I do think we had some marginal improvement, off of a bottom, but I would say that it's probably later than that. And to your point, we are actively working some of the synergy programs there.","Brian Chin","All right, thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You are now live.","Harlan Sur","Yes, hey guys, thanks for taking my follow-up question. On the strong adoption of the Gen 5 wafer inspection platforms, this I think it was originally targeted for sub-7 nanometer nodes over. We keep hearing that customers are adopting Gen 5 for yield improvement even at some of the older nodes, and we also hear that Gen 5 has been adopted earlier by the memory guys. And then you also have EUV print check as another use case. So, how much of these types of buyers are driving the strength in shipments this year versus the real leading edge development activities?","Rick Wallace","We haven't thought about it in those terms. I probably half and half, though, I mean if I thought about it. It's broad use in development. I think what happens in especially since we make improvements to it and drive the productivity of the tool up, then it starts to be competitive in terms of cost of ownership with some applications for Gen 4. But a lot of this, as you might imagine, the discovery aspect of a new product is, you're not really sure what it's going to find and what value, it's going to create.","So now what we're seeing is significant value as you say, even in some maybe more traditional places and frankly what we originally expected was, in some places people might have tried to deploy e-beam inspection, they get away from that by leveraging the much higher throughput of the optical platform. So we kind of see it broadening and feel very good. It took a little while, but we feel very good about the progress there.","Bren Higgins","I think the customers are seeing more and more demand, more and more activity at these other nodes to that that's driving more yield challenges, and so now the tool is faster and so the debugging challenges they're having at even at prior nodes now using the Gen 5 capability to Rick's point, you have a whole bunch -- whole lot of headroom add that enable customers to use that tool for full wafer coverage type yield analysis that didn't exist without the Gen 5 product line out there. So, given the demand there, and how much activity is happening across new designs at those nodes, you're seeing more debugging that's happening there as well.","Rick Wallace","So, just one last dynamic, I think you may know that what a lot of customers do is, it takes them a while to prove out the capability of the tool before they release it even internally for broad years. And so what we've seen in the last couple of quarters as we've kind of broken through at some critical places where they have broader ability now to deploy outside of the first people who were just evaluating it. So that really opens up a number of use cases and hence the significant progress in Gen 5.","Harlan Sur","Yes, thanks for the insights.","Rick Wallace","Thank you. Harlan. That's all the time we have for today's call. Jerome, if you would conclude the call with the final commentary.","Operator","Thank you for joining KLA Corporation's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining our call today. ","With KLA-Tencor's December quarter results, we're pleased to report a very strong finish to a calendar year 2011, which was a record for the company. We saw industry growth in process control, an affirmation of our market leadership. Those forces helped the company achieve annual revenue growth in 2011 that outpaced the overall equipment industry by a wide margin. ","Revenue in calendar year 2011 grew 27% to $3.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.70, an increase of 46% in the year. We generated $940 million in operating cash flow in 2011, ending with just under $2.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet on December 31. We continued to be proactive in returning value to shareholders in 2011, increasing the level of our quarterly dividend payout to $0.35 per share and returning 50% of our total annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase programs. ","Looking at the summary results of the December quarter. Revenue and earnings in Q2 were both down sequentially as expected, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance with revenue of $642 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.72 per diluted share. The big story for December was the sharp increase in quarterly bookings driven by a resurgence in equipment spending among foundry and logic customers, the relative strength of process control as a percentage of the overall equipment investment and customer acceptance of our latest generation products. ","Gross bookings in Q2 were $950 million, an increase of 95% compared with September and the second highest quarterly bookings result in company history. Order activity was particularly strong in the final weeks of the quarter. The Q2 bookings profile featured the high level of demand for our next-generation technologies, with strength across all our major product lines, including record orders in metrology in the quarter. ","In terms of the end market mix, foundry was 57% of new orders in December, focused on 28-nanometer ramps and capacity growth at 32 nanometer. Logic was 27% of Q2 orders with the majority of logic demand coming from a diversified chip manufacturer looking to increase their leading-edge logic capability. Memory was 16% of the total. ","So clearly, a very strong result in December, capping a record calendar year for KLA-Tencor in 2011, and setting the stage for success in 2012. This performance showcases the strength of our market leadership and long-term strategic objectives and highlights industry adoption trends showing chip-makers relying increasingly on the latest inspection and measurement technologies to enable their competitive strategies at the leading edge. ","Shifting gears for a minute, I'd like to highlight recent news on the new product front. One of the key factors underlying KLA-Tencor's market leadership has been our proven success in collaborating closely with our customers, anticipating the potential yield challenges in their leading-edge technology roadmaps and directing our product development activities to deliver differentiated solutions to address those challenges. ","Today, I'm very pleased to highlight the latest fruits of those efforts, with news earlier this week announcing the launch of a suite of 3 new tools for our flagship Brightfield, Darkfield and e-Beam wafer inspection product lines. Each new platform incorporates significant advancements in many key enabling technology of leading-edge defect inspection. These technologies are designed to address the wide range of defect issues that new material structures and design rules are imposing on manufacturers of advanced chips. And we're very encouraged with the high level of customer interest we're seeing for these new technologies. ","Moving on to our view of the current market environment and the trends we expect to play out in 2012. In general, the equipment demand environment today is very similar to what we've outlined throughout this cycle. Despite the persistent macro issues overhanging global economics, the fundamental factors fueling industry CapEx remains strong. The rapid consumer adoption of mobile platforms is driving high levels of foundry in logic CapEx with NAND flash investment eclipsing DRAM spend for the first time in this cycle. And of course, the pace of innovation at leading edge continues unabated, as our customers are innovating across a wide variety of technical, architectural and process approaches to differentiate and gain a competitive advantage. In this environment of mounting cost and complexity, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers' success in executing their growth strategies. And we\u2019re seeing an increased focus on inspection measurements of speed, yield learning and maximize revenue. This is being reflected in the higher adoption we're experiencing in our core markets and the strong relative growth exhibited by KLA-Tencor in calendar 2011. ","For 2012, recent analyst estimates project a range of CapEx of flat to down 10% compared with 2011. Given the adoption growth, KLA-Tencor's strong competitive position and strong new product acceptance, we expect KLA-Tencor to once again outperform the industry in 2012. ","Turning now to our guidance for the March quarter. The Q3 demand picture looks similar to the December quarter, with investments focused on leading edge technology development and concentrated primarily among the foundry and logic customers. Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $825 million to $975 million. We are also projecting very strong sequential revenue and earnings growth, with March revenue expected to be in the range of $770 million to $830 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.18. ","To conclude, we begin 2012 with great optimism as KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product demand and ongoing operational focus position the company to continue to perform at a high-level and deliver industry-leading growth and financial performance in calendar 2012. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?","Mark P. Dentinger","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we presented our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges and credits and in cost of credits, which are outside of our core operations including unusual tax items. ","There was a $0.06 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information but where our reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. ","Q2 new orders were $950 million and net orders were $948 million. Both order figures were up over 95% from last quarter and are very close to our historical quarterly highs. The regional distribution in new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 19% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 25% from in the September quarter; Europe was 2% of new systems orders, down from 7% in Q1; Japan was 9%, up slightly from 8% last quarter; Korea was 28%, down slightly from 29% last quarter; Taiwan was 39%, up from 22% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 3%, down from 9% in Q1. ","The distribution of new orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 47% compared to 28% last quarter; reticle inspection was 13%, down from 18% last quarter; metrology was 22%, up from 14% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 3%, down from 9% last quarter; and service was 15% of new orders in Q2, down from 31% last quarter. ","And finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new orders in Q2 were for foundry customers, flat with Q1; logic customers were 27% of orders in Q2 versus 22% in Q1; and memory orders were 16% in Q2, down from 21% last quarter. ","New orders in December quarter were technology focus with 56% of the orders received in the quarter targeted toward 28 nanometer and below design rules. ","Looking forward, we expect that new orders in Q3 will be within the range of $825 million to $975 million. In Q2, we shipped $700 million versus $690 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $800 million and $860 million in Q3. Total backlog at the end of Q2 increased by about $306 million from September 30 and we ended the quarter with almost $1.4 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at December 31, 2011, included $333 million of revenue backlog, the products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and about $1.03 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped. ","Total revenue for Q2 was $642 million, down 19% from $796 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q2 was down 23% to $501 million. And services revenue was $142 million, down about $4 million from Q1. ","Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $770 million and $830 million. ","Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.4% in the December quarter, about 40 basis points higher than the September quarter, as lower inventory reserve requirements offset the impact of lower revenue. For Q3, we are expecting gross margins between 58% and 59%. ","Operating expenses were $207 million in Q2 compared with $198 million in Q1. Research and development expenses were $115 million in Q2, up $10 million from Q1, driven by material purchases for next-generation platforms. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $91 million in Q2, about even with Q1. We expect operating expenses in Q3 to be about flat with Q2 actuals. OIE was a net $13 million expense in Q2, up over $6 million from Q1. The change in OIE from last quarter was mostly due to a $4 million reserve release in Q1 following resolution of tax exposure and a $1 million change in Q2 due to a write-down of non-marketable investment. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q3. ","In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $34 million or 22% of pre-tax income versus a 23% rate in Q1. Q2 tax expense percentage was lower than Q1, in large part, due to the distribution of taxable earnings between our U.S. and international entities. For guidance purposes, we've used our intermediate-term tax pointing [ph] rate of 26% in arriving at Q3 non-GAAP EPS. ","Non-GAAP net income was $122 million or $0.72 per share in Q2, down from $1.17 per share last quarter. We applied our modeled tax rate of 26%. Q2 non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.68 per share. At the revenue range I previously mentioned and using the tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1 and $1.18 per share. The weighted-average share count used to compute EPS in Q2 was $169.1 million versus $169.8 million in Q1. ","During Q2, we spent $63 million repurchasing about 1.4 million shares. And as of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 5.9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We also paid $58 million in dividends during Q2. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q3. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q3. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, up about $76 million from the end of September. Cash generated from operations was $187 million in Q2 compared to $219 million in Q1. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $544 million, up from $462 million at the end of September. DSOs were 77 days at December 31 versus 53 days at September 30, both DSO figures in net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factoring. Net inventories increased by $27 million from September 30 and ended the quarter at $640 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 1.7 turns in Q2 versus 2.1 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $15 million in Q2, up $3 million from Q1. Total headcount at December 31, 2011, was 5,593, up from 5,547 at September 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q3. ","In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: new orders between $825 million and $975 million; total revenue between $770 million and $830 million; non-GAAP earnings between $1 and $1.18 per share, assuming a tax rate of 26%. ","This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Thanks, Mark. We'll now take your questions. And we once again request each participant to limit to 1 question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get as many callers as possible in the time that we have allocated today. ","With that, operator, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix of orders by device segment and geography that you expect in the March quarter?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, sure. Well, what we're looking forward at March, we see continued strength in foundry. So we think foundry stays at about in the 50s. We have it modeled right now at about 53%. We do expect an increase in memory to about 31% and logic at 16%. And the split of memory is a little bit weighted toward the NAND, probably in the 57%, 60% NAND and then about 5% of non-semi.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. Anything to note in terms of geographical concentration of orders in the March quarter?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, March, we continued to expect it to be relatively broad. I think the 3 kind of main reasons for us right now, U.S. continued strength. We see about 21% in the U.S. Taiwan, we think, will be -- continue to be strong at about 26%. And we expect Korea in the 24% and then pretty good participation from some of the other regions as well but those are the 3 big ones.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And in terms of this uptick you're seeing in memory, which is pretty interesting, historically that's been lagging somewhat in terms of process control adoption and you're sort of seeing a good uptick in December and a stronger one, I guess, into March. Could you talk a little bit about what sort of driving trends in NAND that's perhaps driving more adoption? Or do you think it's this NAND CapEx is sort of going up a bit for the industry?","Richard P. Wallace","I think there's 2 things. One is, metrology. We had a record quarter in metrology, all-time company record in metrology last quarter and that becomes very important in memory, particularly, more so perhaps even in NAND. So that looks to be strong and we continue to see that as we go forward. The other thing is some of our advanced inspection products are performing extremely well and what we're finding is that in some of the vertical structures, our inspection tool and our review tool are uniquely differentiated and customers are now seeing that, that, provides value. In fact, in some cases, there's some customers that bought our advanced tools for their logic work and realized testing on memory that it had additional capability. They hadn\u2019t understood what they've been missing and so we're seeing some proliferation as a result of that. So a very strong product demand on the inspection side supporting particularly NAND.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. Number 1, in terms of bookings for both December and March, did you see any orders for 20 nanometer and below?","Richard P. Wallace","Not so much for 20. Our customers are always looking forward. I'd say the bulk of the orders really are 32 build-out for production and 28 for development. I'd say, there's probably some 28 per ramp. There's definitely some development work that's going on in 20. In fact, even people looking forward to 14 or 18, depending on who they are. But by and large, heavily dependent on 28 nanometer right now.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then, in terms of the memory, I just want to touch on that, too, for a second. I understand it's going some like in the 90 or 65 all the way to like 3x nanometer. You're inspection and your metrology touch points actually doubled. So are we actually just buying more of the same equipment or do you have to retool the whole fab at 3x and sub-3x nanometer?","Richard P. Wallace","No. It's new equipment, and what we're seeing, in particular, I highlighted a couple of products that are really working. The one we mentioned in the call prepared remarks is the new suite of products. We've got the new Brightfield tool, the new Darkfield tool and the e-Beam review. I think all of those are very exciting results what we're seeing in memory and as I said earlier, customers starting to see and discover problems they didn't know they had. And so I think that's the discovery process is going on and that's driving additional demand. So right now, frankly, our biggest challenge is meeting demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citigroup.","Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Wenge Yang for Terence. A question about gross margin and revenue is up roughly 25%, if I take the midpoint but the gross margin is pretty much flat. I just want to hear what's the read in that gross margins not expanding with the revenue.","Mark P. Dentinger","Well, the revenue was down quarter-on-quarter, and in fact, I explained in my preferred remarks, it's down about $150 million. And yet, gross margin is actually slightly improved and the reason was is that they -- we -- the capacity release was actually offset by the fact that we actually had lower inventory reserves requirements in this quarter. So what you should see is the result of these 2 phenomena and as we move forward and the revenue improves, you should see some slight improvements in the gross margin moving forward.","Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So a couple of things in terms of gross margin. One is the customer consolidation, do you see actually additional pressure on the pricing front that could pressure your gross margin? On the other side, you have some new products going out. Does that help your gross margin in terms of added capacity -- capability to your new tools?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. I never viewed consolidation as impacting gross margin. I think gross margin is really a measure of how unique and differentiated your products are. And if you're able to maintain differentiation and create value for customers, you're going to get the gross margin. And that's what we saw in the quarter that we had and we expect that going forward. And it's a function of our cycle of heavy investment in R&D-differentiated products creating a lot of value for our customers. So I don't think it's a function of consolidation. I think it's a function of differentiation.","Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. In terms of a product -- the new product, does that impact your gross margin positively?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, as Mark said, we expect to see gross margins improving over time, as revenue goes back up but we continue with the model that we established some years ago in terms of incremental margin. And from our standpoint, a lot of that is driven by operational efficiency but we're pretty happy with our relative position in gross margin in the industry and pretty heavily focused on maintaining and improving that. But we feel pretty good about where we are.","Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just 1 quick follow-up. What is the schedule for your e-Beam reticle inspection tool?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, right now, we're still in development but our expectation is that we've got EUV capability built in the Teron platform that we've got now. We'll be able to meet industry demand for several years with the product that we have and then we're in development. And we're fully confident we'll be in position when EUV goes to production to support it with an actinic tool.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Olga. Given the substantial uptick in your orders in the December quarter, do you still plan on managing your backlog to approximately 6 months or do you expect this magnitude of orders to really drive more of an extension on how you manage your backlog?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, at the current levels of both the new order activity and production, we're just actually running to keep that pace right now. It's pretty high. If the new order activity were to go up, you can see with our expected shipment and revenue activity for Q3, you could actually see the backlog increase slightly but our focus right now is to actually get the new tools built and out to customers as quickly as possible. But as you can imagine, that puts a lot of stress on vendors. The factories are full and we're doing everything we can to keep up. We're certainly not intentionally trying to grow it but it is a byproduct of the new order activity and how fast we can get it out.","Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up question on your outlook for 2012. Given the predominance of foundry and logic and the mix especially in the next few quarters and the need for them to really improve their yields, how do you think about process control intensity this year? And following up on that, given your attraction with metrology and NAND, how do you think about your market share this year as well?","Mark P. Dentinger","Olga, 2 great questions. And based on what we're seeing actually, through this cycle, not just in the last quarter, but foundry demand being strong because they really need what we provide and we're uniquely positioned to do that. And they're facing some real yield challenges. We expect 2012 to be another strong year for KLA-Tencor and one where we'll outpace the industry. It's really anyone's bet how the industry is going to do. I think that some of the recent announcements show CapEx nudging upwards overall and predominantly in areas that should support KLA-Tencor business. So we're well prepared to outperform the industry again in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Rick, I guess, the first question would be the breadth of your customers seems a lot better than the rest of the industry and ultimately, one would think those 2 things kind of have to tie together. And so could you give us a little bit of perspective on historically, when we've seen sort of the lack of breadth outside of KLA but such good breadth within KLA before and then kind of what's happened on either side of that?","Richard P. Wallace","Jim, great question. I think the phenomenon that's going on right now has to do with what's going on in the markets that are being served in the mobility play. In particular, what's happening is what we're seeing. Die size is increasing. And Jim, you and I both remember when die size used to increase but it's been a while. And to satisfy the mobility market, what you're seeing is the processors are getting bigger, supporting smartphones, supporting tablets. And that creates a unique advantage for KLA-Tencor because it means the yield becomes much more critical for these guys. They might have capacity. In fact, we know they've got capacity at older generations. But on the new stuff, they've got to get it up and they got to get yielding, and it's right in the sweet spot for us. So I think that's a lot of what we're seeing right now. And the foundry wars that are going on -- it really based about mobility. We checked in about half our business has been driven by the PC server market and the other half is now being driven by a foundry, driving the support of tablets and smartphones. And those are growing at a rapid pace and so our view is we will be the big winners in that.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then I guess -- that's very helpful. And then, relative -- your June quarter is usually a very, very strong quarter because it's a seasonal -- yes, it's your fiscal year end. On the other side of that, you're coming off a tremendous performance now. I mean, how would you expect sort of the year to play out from the sequential basis for modeling purposes?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, as we said, we think we'll outperform the industry again in 2012, that's certainly our plan. Very hard to handicap what the overall industry is going to do. But I'd say the segments that are likely to invest, all the signals that we're getting for our customers, certainly play to our strength. And I'd say, in particularly, what we're seeing in foundry logic, and also even in NAND, as NAND increases. I think DRAM is likely to remain soft throughout the year. I just don't see a tremendous driver for that business. So we feel pretty bullish about it, very hard to handicap June at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Rick, if I could follow up on the process control intensity question for a moment. Lots of talk in the industry, as people are beginning to scale 2X around whether or not it's scaling the way 4X did, if there's new issues or not. Curious on your perspective there, how 2X ramps compared to what you saw at 4X. I'm sure the sources of defect density are somewhat different, but how that compares. And then as you think about the process control intensity, and you mentioned that it appears to be going up in memory which we've been waiting for, for a while, any numbers you can put around that to kind of give some indication of the slope of improvement you might expect in the context to some of the trends you talked about over the next couple of years?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, to your question, new types. I don't think it's a function of necessarily new types. Many of the same types, the defects, but much smaller and devices that are much more sensitive to it. I mentioned -- I was talking to Jim that the die size getting bigger means that there is even an increased sensitivity to defectivity at the same level when you're trying ramp die size and shrink at the same time. The other thing though, and I want to stress this, is metrology has really kicked in. And we didn't necessarily see the same strength in metrology in the past. And the old tag line for K-T is, \"If you can't measure it, you can't control it. And if you can't inspect it, you can't fix it.\" And I think both of those things are working to our favor right now. As far as NAND, I still think it's relatively early in the adoption cycle of what we're going to see as a percent of CapEx with NAND. We have some very encouraging signs. We are finding capabilities in our tools as we work closely with customers that are getting them excited about deploying them. But I think it\u2019s early to say what the overall model is going to look like, but we certainly anticipate improvement off of where we've been in the past there.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If I could, Mark. This is a follow-up. Could you comment on how to think about expense trajectory across the year? I know it\u2019s early but maybe a comment there.","Mark P. Dentinger","No, it's not that -- we're certainly thinking about it, Raj. The truth of the matter is, right now, KLA is continuing to increase our hiring and we would anticipate that expenses -- the operating expenses  are going to increase as the year goes on, not significantly initially, but we're anticipating towards the end of the year with new product introductions and whatnot. But we will have some increased operating expenses particularly in materials that we need to run in for new generation products. So that's our mindset right now. Of course, we have to be wary of what the industry and macro signals are as we move through the year. So you can take that guidance in the context of it's what we're seeing right now. But that's our mindset today, and certainly in support of a lot of the success we've had on the recent products, we don't -- we certainly don't want to us [indiscernible] the sales or the installation and support channels that we built up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I guess on the prior call, you talked about having pretty good visibility -- order visibility through June. Obviously, the orders are coming in much stronger than expected. I think there was some -- maybe some pull-in from June to December and March. How should we think about the expense of your visibility at this point?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I guess our visibility wasn't quite as good as we thought, since it heated up quite a bit in December. What we see is a lot of interest. And what we're seeing now, the business that we got in the December quarter wasn't from June. I think what it was, was an increase in intensity by some of the customers that are chased really to meet the growing demand around devices that are very hot in the market, the mobility devices, smartphones and tablets. And that seems to continue to grow. So that's part of what we're seeing and when we had talked about the March guide. So we've kind of kicked into a new gear here, and I don't know how to handicap June based on that. We don't typically guide that far. But we're pretty confident that however the industry does, the overall industry perspective is flat to down 10. We feel pretty comfortable with our position that we ought to be able to outperform it. And with our business model, we ought to be able to financially perform very well in this year.","Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And can you give some indication as far as what product bookings, categories might be -- which might be stronger or weaker in the March quarter?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we had a strong quarter, as I said, in metrology and a great quarter in wafer. We've really had a good quarter. I'd say, overall, we're handicapping, if I had to do that now, I'd say wafer, 51% at March; metrology at 16%; reticle at 11%; and our services business in the 17% range; and then the hard disk drive, another -- about 5%. That's how you ground it up. So metrology, not quite as strong; and reticle, not quite as strong; wafer, picking up; and service, picking up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Blansett with JPMorgan.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Rick, I wanted to ask you about this trend of increasing die sizes and potentially lower yields -- effective yields and what you think this means to the footprint out there? And how much additional CapEx you might expect to offset this declining productivity basically trend [ph]?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I don't think our customers plan on doing anything but getting the yields up with the capacity that they have. That's why I think you're seeing us differentially perform in this market. So I think their expectation is they're going to get yields off of the die even if they're getting larger, and that's why I think we should get a higher percent of the CapEx. And so as we model -- we talked about it before, the CapEx inspection measurement increasing as a function of the overall, and we're certainly seeing signs of that now. We haven't fully demonstrated it in memory yet. We have early signs but we're definitely seeing it in the foundry space.","Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then the second question was tied to your R&D spend. You talked about next-generation platforms, is this also starting to be the transition in the 450 in a more accelerated matter?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, certainly, we got development programs for 450 and we've just mapped out -- and we have a planning cycle we look out to 2015, and we've mapped out our investment from now through 2015 in all our major -- all our product lines, actually. And yes, over that time period, we've got major platforms being developed and we've got 450 coming in. We have -- so the first 450 capable tools now and we'll be shipping them in 2012, but I don't anticipate large scale manufacturing of any type in the several year timeframe, but certainly, investment on our behalf on 450.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you maybe elaborate a little on the yields under the customer is seeing right now? I know you said there were a lot of new customers lucky to use your tools. So maybe you could give us a sense on what's on the yields are in the foundry space today and when we can expect capacity rise [ph] to kick in?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we're -- Vishal, a good question. There aren't really new customers. I think -- again, we're pretty much solid to everybody and have been. I think there are customers with increasing adoption needs. In other words, we're putting -- deploying more inspection earlier in their development process and more of it to cover all the challenges they're facing. In yields, as always, range, we don't discuss individual customer yields. But certainly, on 28-nanometer, you've got a large range. But the biggest thing is, you got more design starts now and expectations in the market for 28-nanometer, just it's overheated. And so our customers are trying to be very responsive to the demands that are being placed on them. And there's clearly from their standpoint, the highest lever they can pull from a productivity standpoint, the cost standpoint, is to go after yields. And so we're seeing that as being an imperative that they have and one that we can help them with.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And in our NAND slide, I see an uptick from -- begins from a broader set of customers or just maybe 1 or 2 customers?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, there aren't that many NAND customers. So from that standpoint, we sold all of them, but the phenomena is the same across the board. I would say customer to customer, they have perhaps different issues. Some have slightly different approaches to yield management, but the underlying themes are the same when we talk to them. Defects, they worry about defects and vertical structures. They've certainly worried about metrology and that creates opportunities for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffrey.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions. First up, how should we think about in calendar '12 year-over-year growth between your wafer inspection segment and metrology given the backdrop of logic and foundry spending?","Richard P. Wallace","That's a great question. And as I said, we saw metrology really kicking up, and I expect that, that continues but we've got huge demand for wafer, too. So I think the mix we're talking about going forward, if you think about our overall business being, say, 50% wafer and 15% to 20% metrology is probably about right. Reticle is pretty lumpy so it kind of comes in and out depending on just a few unit sales. But I think that continues. Strong demand in both, but we're really excited about the metrology performance because we have seen a kick up, as I said recently. And I think really critical for our customers to get that new capability that we have.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And second one, I just wanted to follow-up, do you know what -- given that you ended calendar '11 with such strong performance, can you tell us what was your market share in process control as a whole in calendar '11, please?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. We looked at that. Year-on-year, we're kind of in the same range. So I think we gained a little bit of share over -- but we had a very strong calendar '10 also. So I'd say pretty similar. There are always puts and takes in that. But I think we probably differentially performed last quarter as an example on a very strong quarter in the year. So I think a little bit stronger adoption's been going up and we're benefiting from that for sure.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. One -- just a quick one. I know you had presented in SEMICON a while ago that process control could go as high as 17% or something like that. Do you think that at some point of time this year that you would probably see that kind of intensity?","Richard P. Wallace","It varies. I think customers go through their own cycles and it very much depends. 17% seems much higher than what we've modeled. One way we think about it is 14% at 30 billion WFE, somewhere in that. That's a $3.2 billion business for us, and that's kind of how we look at it. And if we look back, 2011 was about that 2012 probably in that range as well.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question on the customer capacity purchases versus technology upgrades. Do you get the sense that customers' dollars spent per wafer start on process control between capacity addition, technology upgrades are kind of similar for KLA? Because in other segments of WFE, we're seeing a bigger delta between dollars spent on capacity additions versus technology upgrades.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, where capacity -- you're saying capacity spends end up being a predominant component?","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, No, I mean for us, it is definitely true that we perform well in a technology environment and will get it -- people are always moving forward on technology and so our business often holds up. I would say what's changing now is some of the metrology businesses in particular end up being more linked to ramping. But I also think that we differentially perform relative to other capacity right now because just there's so much to control. And so the measurement and control requirements are increasing. And I'd say if you thought about our business generally, metrology would be a little bit more linked to capacity and inspection a little bit more linked to technology. And then if we're in the wafer business when we do support, the wafer manufacturers, that's really tied to both but that would be predominantly capacity related, which by the way, is not very hot. So we had a great quarter without a strong wafer market.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just another follow-up question on the strong foundry orders. Are you thinking that the foundry spend could be sustainable into the second half if foundries try to perhaps position themselves for new design wins later in the year? Or do you think foundry has a typical digestion period at some point this year?","Richard P. Wallace","I think it's logical to assume that these things ebb and flow. And so if I integrate it over the year, I'd say foundry is very strong in the December quarter, but again, stronger than what we originally modeled, and we're looking at it very strong now. But when I talked to them, they're talking about sustained ramps to meet the needs that their customers have. And what is surprising is how well how many of them are doing. This is not a one customer phenomenon. And I think it's kind of fascinating to watch what's going on in terms of all the different devices. There's a high-end tablet and there's a low-end tablet, and the low-end tablets driving a lot of fair amount of CapEx, too. And it's kind of fascinating to watch because it's very broad right now. So I'd say the momentum is pretty strong and I think a lot depends on the success they have as they try to ramp these new yields.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question for Mark. As you see more metrology come into your revenue mix, I believe those that at lower margin strides or should I assume that you're incremental growth margin will still stay in your model range of 50% to 60%?","Mark P. Dentinger","I think you can assume the latter, Krish. But I wouldn't necessarily assume the former.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. All right. And then just one other question for Rick, I don't know if someone else asked this. On the customer concentration on the foundry orders, are you seeing any Tier 2 foundry start placing orders for like 40 and below nanometer?","Richard P. Wallace","They're all Tier 1 to us, Krish. We see multiple foundries placing orders.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Rick, going back to your comment about foundry logic is strong. How should I think about this if WFE spending is going to be flat to down 10%, would process diagnostic be kind of flattish? I'm just trying to get a sense how the process diagnostic intensity -- spending intensity is going to compare to overall WFE?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. The way we modeled -- that is we take a very simple of view of 14% is what we're modeling now. Last quarter, I'd say it was certainly stronger than that. But being conservative, we look across the year, we'd say 14%, and that gets 2010 -- 2011 to look a lot like 2012 or 2012 look like 2011. Is there upside for that? There are definitely could be upside based on the early returns at the beginning of -- what we're seeing, there's certainly some momentum, but that's not how we're modeling it yet.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure. And then you did talk about diversity of the customers that was behind near doubling in the gross booking. But in terms of the number of customers, almost the doubling in the sequential basis, is that driven by like, 5 customers, 10 customers, 15, 20? Any way you can help us understand the breadth of the customers coming back?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, it's -- there's still a limited number of guys that are 28 and 40 to 28 is really the sweet spot for our markets, so you kind of know who those players are. What's interesting is the intensity ramping out of some of the ones that haven't been investing necessarily in new technology. And that's why we're saying it is pretty broad right now relative to a fairly concentrated market that we have in this space. But of course, that makes our selling very efficient, it makes service very efficient. So for our standpoint, we're fine with that. But it is not -- there are no true new entrants into it. As you know, there's one large bank in Korea that's made a big investment in getting into foundry logic and been increasing that. But other than that, it's partially similar players but focusing on new technology.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So it does make the forecasting more challenging, correct?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, long-term forecasting is pretty easy, short term is not possible. And so, when we look at it, we think, as I said, flat to down 10 for 2012, I think is not a crazy number to model. And right now, I think K-T does as well in 2012 as we did in 2011, maybe better in terms of overall revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just quickly on new bookings and the growing backlog. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand, how much of the current backlog and the new orders you expect to book in Q1 are shippable in the first half? And how much of that do you think will flow into the second half?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. The typical cycle between the time we take the order and to when we ship can range anywhere from 3 months to 9 months. It depends on the product. But we think about it in the 4.5-month range on average in general. So that's sort of a loose proxy on how to think about that, West. And then there's another 90-day cycle after that, that usually results in the final acceptance of revenue recognition.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. And then just a quick clarification on shipment guidance. I wrote $800 million, $850 million, was it $850 million or $860 million that you said?","Richard P. Wallace","$860 million, 8-6-0.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you just, I guess, give me a little bit of color in terms of what the high demand that you're seeing near-term and the ramp in terms of getting the tools to your customers? How are you keeping OpEx levels flat as you mentioned for the March quarter? What are the levers -- given that you also mentioned you're increasing hiring and so forth. What are the levers there that are keeping OpEx levels flat?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. There's a couple of things in place. First of all, we're increasing hiring, but our hiring still is at a very relatively low ramp rate, approximately the same level of hiring increase that you saw in the prior quarter which is in the 1% range. And it takes a while for those people to get on board and to get up to speed. We don't feel the full expense of that instantaneously at the beginning of the quarter. But the other phenomenon is, is that the big contributor to our spending, particularly research and development, is the amount of new material we move in. And we have some visibility on that because that has to be scheduled considerably in advance with suppliers and so on and so forth. So quarter-to-quarter, if the $200 million to $210 million level, if things can go up or down and throw you up $5 million in either direction, so I don't want to imply more science than really exists on this. We just simply roll out the divisions in terms of their planned spending in the quarter. They're usually fairly thorough on how they forecast it. But as you know, it's an educated guess at this point. I would just say that flatfish is a good planning assumption. But could it be up or down a little bit from there? Absolutely.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I know. Fair enough. Maybe a bigger picture in terms of the metrology, some of the questions you've taken today, the pickup that you're seeing and I'm going to assume it's a little bit of both or maybe a little more color on it, it's probably a little bit of both of market demand increase, as well as potential share opportunities. Rick, maybe if you could give a little color, how that mix is working in KLA's favor on both of those ends?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. Well, what has happened I think is on advanced [indiscernible] -- just to give you a very specific example, people doing more inspection. For example, in a registration tool where you're measuring overlay, they're measuring more spots on a wafer and they're measuring more wafers in a lot and they're doing that because they need better control. And that's a market where KLA is very strong. And as a result, we see demand going up and we benefit from that. In other ones like OCD, optical CD control where we have a strong position, there, we've actually seen good adoption by customers and some share gain as our technologies have been differentiated from our competitors. So we're getting some of both as a result but there's definitely demand increase. And to your point, we've also benefited from some share movement. But really, you have to go product by product.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And a final question for me in terms of NAND and the 3D device stacking and the TSV move that's going on, on the NAND side of things. I'm sure that you're working with the customers on both inspection and metrology. I guess bigger picture, where do you see the potential bigger opportunity, maybe now or just otherwise, but in terms of the tool adoptions on a volume basis?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, most of the business we see in NAND is not in the TSV and the back end. It's in the wafer manufacturing itself. And it has to do with the design rules plus the vertical nature of the devices, so the requirements on registration and metrology for measuring 3D devices. But we also have inspection capability that's being leveraged as those designs will shrink and people are much more sensitive to defects that they, in the past, perhaps weren't sensitive to or they just didn't know they could find. So not so much back end, definitely for us, WFE and pretty strong demand. And I think the -- it's pretty split. We definitely see metrology strength there but we've got some great inspection opportunities as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So one of your customer, Sanders, yesterday said that they plan to push out fab 5. Do you see that as potentially impacting your whole business in the first half of 2012?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, first of all, we don't talk specifically about specific customers. But certainly, the model we have for CapEx for 2012 encompasses all the input that we've got and there's some puts and takes in that. But by and large, what we see for 2012 is CapEx to be in the range of flat to down 10% and that there were no surprises in any of the recent announcements that we've seen that impact our thinking on that.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, that was helpful. And then there's some chatter -- recent chatter about DRAM customer consolidating. How do you see that impacting your business? Are you worried that your customer coming together become bigger buyers may potentially negotiate on pricing?","Richard P. Wallace","I think it's actually not a bad thing for the industry to have strong players. Nothing has been finalized in any of those discussions. But in general, we're best positioned when our customers are strong and healthy and financially doing well. And so anything that leads to that is ultimately good for the industry because they can invest in R&D, they can keep developing new technologies and we can work with them closely. So that's not something that we're particularly sensitive to if it happens or if it doesn't happen.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","If I can squeeze one more question in. You mentioned about metrology picking up this past quarter. I was wondering how do you think about the metrology versus inspection market in the coming year Do you see the metrology continue -- potentially outgrow in the inspection space?","Richard P. Wallace","No, I think it's going to be a close battle, and those divisions are kind of both shooting for demonstrating their capability. They're different drivers. I'd say that lithography space, all the challenges in litho drive a lot of what we have in metrology, whether it's registration or the OCD business or the films, business, all related to that. The defectivity is driven -- drives us pretty strongly in what we see in the wafer, and both have a strong currents of pushing them forward right now. So I think very strong business is in both of them. And we're really pleased to have the broad portfolio we do to support our customers' needs.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, since you've been talking about metrology, maybe I'll ask another metrology question. If you can provide us some more details on -- among overlay versus OCD or registration, are you seeing an inflection in some of the -- one of the technologies, 28, 22-nanometer? Or it's more mostly gradual improvement or impaired -- gradual increase in the intensity?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, there's no question that there are definitely -- there have been opportunities I think for what we're seeing. A big part of what's happening is KTL's gain share in some of those segments. And so from that standpoint, I think the demand has been there, but our differentiated solutions are winning in the markets. So a big part of what we've been seeing in increase is a function of product positioning and frankly, competitors stumbling.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And so can you provide us a little bit color on -- is that more on the foundry side or NAND side or logic side of your market share gains of the requirements?","Richard P. Wallace","So we don't break it out, as I said, there are demands in both. Certainly, foundries have pushed very hard on demands on metrology as have the memory guys. But most of our business last quarter was around logic and foundries and that's where we saw the strength in metrology as that was a bigger part of our business. Memory was only 16% of our business overall last quarter. So the fact metrology was a record implies very strong logic performance and long -- very strong foundry performance.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters.","Richard P. Wallace","Thank you, Sean. And thank you, all, for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking you -- with you throughout the quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Magen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Magen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's investor relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017.","In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Wallace","Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Leading off with the December quarter highlights, KLA-Tencor reported another record quarter, delivering new quarterly highs in shipments, revenues, gross margin, non-GAAP earnings per share in the period. Full year results for calendar 2017 also set records in each of these metrics as well as in free cash flow generation. These outstanding results demonstrate the dedication that runs throughout our organization to serving our customers and delivering results to our stockholders as well as the long-term value generated and successful execution of the company's strategic objectives.","I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the dynamics underlying our record performance and the momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today. I will begin with the orders for our optical inspection products, including both patterned and un-patterned wafer inspection, which grew 18% in calendar 2017, following 11% growth in 2016. Total optical inspection revenue grew to record levels for the second consecutive year in 2017.","The same expansion we are experiencing in these core markets for KLA-Tencor are partially driven by strong customer acceptance of three of our major pattern inspection systems. Gen 5, our flagship broadband plasma inspection platform, is being deployed by customers across all segments and is solving their most critical defect in yield challenges. The ramp of Gen 5 is performing to our expectations and we are seeing an increasing number of layers implemented for production, for advanced logic and memory devices.","In addition, the Gen 4 broadband plasma inspection platform and the Puma laser scanning platforms continue to provide the most cost effective wafer inspection performance to meet current yield and quality production requirements. Additionally, our un-patterned or bare wafer inspection and metrology products are also experiencing record demand today. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new process control capability to meet strong wafer demand, while IC customers are adding new bear wafer products to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in a greater number of layers for advanced technologies.","Next, KLA-Tencor is playing an enabling role in bringing EUV lithography technology to market, by collaborating with every EUV customer to accelerate technology development and yield learning for critical wafer and mask inspection applications. The process control applications inherent to EUV mainly lie in mask manufacturing and requalification, resist qualification and scanner control.","These along with the unique patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV sourced technology present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive suite of product technologies in the industry. We are already generating meaningful revenue from early adoption of EUV and this new technology promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and as the market leader for KLA.","And finally growth in China, investment in the Chinese semiconductor industry is currently driving an inflection in demand for the global wafer fab equipment market. And the China build out is expected to be a major factor underlying industry growth for years to come. As the leader in process control, KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong, both in terms of customer share and an adoption. Orders from native Chinese customers nearly tripled in 2017 and this strong momentum is expected to continue into 2018.","In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2017 results demonstrate the company's innovation and technology leadership. We are operating from a position of strength, as we embark on another year of expected growth and strong stockholder returns. Looking ahead to 2018, given our record backlog levels and the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today, revenue growth is expected to be in the high single digits for the year and is positioned to outperform overall WFE industry growth.","As always, KLA-Tencor's strong relative performance will be fueled by our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' success and our continued focus on operations execution. The stage is set to build on the momentum and record performance delivered in calendar 2017 and deliver what we expect to be another exciting year of growth in 2018.","I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution in the December quarter and in calendar 2017. Shipments, revenues, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end or above the range of guidance and achieved new records in both the December quarter and for the calendar year.","Revenue in the quarter was 976 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97 and would have been $1.83 at the guided tax rate of 18% for the quarter. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.86 in December, largely resulting from a charge taken in the quarter for the transition tax on historical cumulative earnings outside of the US and tax asset and liabilities revaluation related to the new tax law. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now, turning to highlights of the December quarter, demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were 1.041 billion in December, up 7% sequentially and finishing above the guided range for the quarter as customer pull for tool deliveries across the product portfolio drove upside to the quarter. Looking forward, we are modeling March quarter shipments to be in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion. Our expectation is for shipment levels for the first half of calendar '18 to be roughly flat compared to the second half of 2017 and with low to mid single digit have to have growth planned in the second half of the calendar year.","For the full year, shipments are expected to grow in the high single digits compared with 2017. Memory was 71% of shipments and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the March quarter with memory shipments expected to be approximately 70% of the quarter total. Foundry was 20% of shipments in December, as expected and Foundry is forecasted to be about 15% of shipments in March. Logic was 9% of shipments in the December quarter and is currently forecasted to be 15% in March.","In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments; patterning was 30%. Patterning includes orders for reticle inspection. Service was 21% and non-semi was approximately 2%.","I'll turn now to further details of the income statement. As I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 976 million in December. We expect revenue to be in the range of 970 million to 1.03 billion in the March quarter. In terms of half to half expectations for 2018, we are currently modeling revenue in the second half of the year to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus the first half of the calendar year.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, a new record for the company and above the guided range of 63% to 64%, largely as a result of a stronger than modeled product mix. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% in the March quarter. In the earnings call last October, we provided gross margin expectations of 63% to 64% for calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for revenue growth, customer acceptance of key products, cost management and execution and the mix of system business in the year. Looking ahead, we believe our gross margins will likely bias towards the higher end of this guided range in 2018.","Total non-GAAP operating expenses were 262 million in Q4, up as expected compared with the September quarter due to expenses related to advanced technology development programs for EUV lithography. Non-GAAP operating margin was flat compared to Q3 at 37.7%. We are currently sizing operating expense levels to be approximately 255 million in the March quarter. Beyond that, our outlook is for quarterly operating expenses to be in the $260 million range throughout calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for high single digit revenue growth for the year and consistent with our published business model.","Given the strong gross margin profile I referenced, we should continue to deliver operating margins at the higher - or the upper end or above this model for the foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the quarter, resulting from the required true-up of our tax rate estimate for fiscal year '18, ending in June due to the reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1. Included in the GAAP results is an estimated charge of approximately 442 million associated with the new tax law passed by Congress and signed by the President in late December.","The vast majority of the charge is related to the transition tax for the accumulative historical earnings the company earned outside of the US. In addition, we also incurred a charge related to revaluing our deferred tax assets based on the lower US tax rate. This tax charge will be adjusted over the next few quarters as additional financial information and regulatory guidance and interpretation becomes available.","In terms of the expected impact of the new tax law on KLA-Tencor, our preliminary analysis indicate the changes in the tax law will be beneficial to the company and to our stockholders, as the annual ongoing US tax liability for the company will be meaningfully lower. Furthermore, the new territorial tax system will enable us additional flexibility to repatriate future foreign earnings and allow access to cash to productively invest in the business, pursue compelling strategic growth opportunities and return cash to stockholders without any additional US tax liability.","Based on our initial modeling, we expect the overall worldwide tax planning rate of 20% provided last October, based on the expected mix of business in 2018 to decrease by approximately 500 basis points and allow access to all free cash flow generated, irrespective of geographical IP ownership or manufacturing location. As a result, going forward, the new recommended tax rate for modeling purposes is 15%.","Finally, net income for the December quarter was 309 million and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.76 billion, a decrease of approximately 298 million compared with the September quarter, primarily due to repayment and maturity of 250 million in public bonds and a net reduction of 40 million in bank loans. Cash from operations was 129 million in the quarter and free cash flow was 116 million. For the full year in 2017, free cash flow was 1.14 billion. Consistent with our proactive track record of returning cash to stockholders, we believe that unallocated free cash flow is valued only when it is productively deployed. Going forward, the new tax environment will afford the company additional flexibility to continue to optimize this fundamental aspect of the company's strategy. We will have more to say on this topic in the coming weeks.","In December, we paid an aggregate of 92.6 million regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $40 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. The company has approximately 4.9 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in December reflect our market leadership and our industry leading business model. This coupled with ending total backlog of approximately 1.9 billion position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '18. Current forecasts are for the WFE market to grow mid-single digits in 2018. Against this industry setting, we are modeling the company revenue to grow in the high single digits in the year, stronger than the broader market and with operating performance expected at the high end of the range of these revenue levels in our target model.","So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is, shipments in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion; revenue between 970 million and 1.03 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 to $2.09 per share with GAAP diluted EPS of $1.84 to $2.08 per share.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you. Bren. And is always, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per firm and a brief follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. Okay. Magen, we're ready for the first question.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the overall strategy for capital deployment. Can you just talk about how are you thinking about [indiscernible]. And if I think about your prior commentary, you've always said that if it's a tax reform, you would think about giving back more to the shareholders. So if you can just comment on that, that would be really helpful.","Bren Higgins","Sure, Farhan. It's Bren. Thanks for the question. It's certainly an exciting time for the company and I think given our historical track record around how we think about deploying cash in the business, either investing in the business or how we look at M&A opportunities or certainly returns to shareholders, it's an opportunity that adds additional flexibility to what we can do going forward. As I said in the prepared remarks, we don't have any update today, although, we do expect to have more to say on the topic in the coming weeks. I would say philosophically, our position is no different.","We have a great business, a strong business model. It's not capital intensive and so the free cash flow margin is pretty strong. And so, we have the ability to return, I think, a fair amount of cash to shareholders, if that is where our process takes us. We're not compelled at this point to do any significant de-levering. We've been doing that over the course of the year. We have the leverage in the right place for the company.","And so going forward, I think we have to look at the alternatives and make those calls. Our feelings haven't changed. We're going to grow the dividend certainly over time, consistent with the growth rate in cash flow. And, or the earnings of the company and we're going to target a payout ratio that's somewhere in the through cycle 40% to 50%. So I think that part of the strategy is well understood. And as far as the cash reserves on the balance sheet, we'll have more to say about that coming in the next few weeks.","Farhan Ahmad","And then, in regards to my second question, can you just talk about the e-beam versus optical. There is a concern in the market that ASML is ramping their holistic lithography. That can be a threat to your business. Can you just, at a high level, talk about how do you see that as a competitor to the optical inspection technology?","Rick Wallace","Sure. We've seen, as you know Farhan, the Gen 5 has really been the tool we've been deploying for leading edge really across the board with our customers in terms of advanced memory, both in NAND, but also in DRAM, but also in advanced logic and we've seen good adoption of that. As we said in the prepared remarks, we continue to see development being - leveraging the capabilities of Gen 5 and that product has a lot of legs.","As you know, that was recently introduced and there's quite a roadmap for that. So, customers definitely want the coverage capable, only really delivered by Gen 5 and they want to have continue to be able to leverage optical, just the price performance relative to e-beam. There is a place for e-beam, there's been a place for e-beam for many years and we suspect that will continue. But on a relative basis, we had a record year in optical wafer inspection in 2017 and we expect that to continue in 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","We're hearing that in addition to using Gen 5 for print check and also for early defect learning for EUV based technologies that some of your customers may be actually looking to use Gen 5 for high volume production, even this year before EUR, just given some of the yield challenges associated with some of these next generation manufacturing technologies. Is it something that you guys are actually seeing and is this just with your foundry and logic customers or is this also across some of your memory customers?","Rick Wallace","Harlan, great question. As is typical, when we introduce a new tool, depending on the particular user and their ability to understand the value and to leverage in, some of the early users tend to deploy first in production. We are seeing it in production on some layers. There are typically the more critical layers where it provides a pronounced benefit from capabilities they had before. We have had recent customer experience where they're now able to detect inline defects that they before could only see end of line, as they were missed by prior optical tools and also not detectable by e-beam. So those tools are being deployed in line. It really is in both logic and memory structures, perhaps a little more surprising with some of the memory applications that we've seen. So we're encouraged by those signs and we fully expect that to continue.","Bren Higgins","Harlan, it's Bren. The only thing I'll add is, is that Gen 5, the reception to Gen 5 from a value perspective has been really strong with the customer base over the last 12 to 18 months or so. And as we look at 2018, part of the company's year-to-year performance is driven by a bigger contribution from that product line. So, you mentioned print checks. Certainly, there's a lot of value that's demonstrated there. Defect discovery is still the place where it competes and where we saw the growth there where it has made significant inroads against the e-beam opportunities for the reasons Rick talked about earlier. But then also in some of these really high end opportunities in early production and difficult layers, so really across all segments, we're pretty confident with what we're seeing there and excited to get a higher level adoption of this product as we move forward over the course of the year.","Harlan Sur","And then on EUV mask inspection, as EUV starts to ramp here, what's the traction been like with the Teron platform in conjunction with 5 for print check, first question. And then more importantly, for kind of next generation high volume EUV mask inspection, can you guys just give us an update on your multi-beam mask inspection platform. What's been the early feedback from your lead alpha customers here?","Rick Wallace","Sure. The Teron isn't really used for print check, it's used for the mask development. So - and that's, we're seeing great demand for that across a number of players, simply because of the increased activity in terms of EUV mask production. So that's really the workhorse right now for the industry in terms of, for the, [indiscernible]. We have had a lot of interest in multi-beam. I do think customers, as they contemplate high volume, they are going to work through, I think, a couple of scenarios.","The most likely is, there will be some level of e-bean inspection and there'll be print check inspection and the print check, we're well suited to support that with the Gen 5 platform and there's a lot of interest as I said in the multi-beam and we've got a heavy customer engagements on that front. But as we said, when we first started discussing that tool, that's still a ways out, I think that we will intercept the market when it's needed in terms of volume. Right now, it's really people preparing for volume down the road.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","I guess first question, when I think about your WFE guide and I compare it to Lam's, you're coming in a little bit lighter and it sounds like DRAM was one of the principal drivers of the uplift at least for them. So I guess a question off of that which is, are you contemplating upside from DRAM within your model here in calendar '18, particularly as you think about some of the more logic related structures that are being adopted, as we move to 18-nanometer, would love to hear your thoughts on that front.","Rick Wallace","Yes. C.J., I don't think we're that far off where Lam is, we're talking about, at the beginning of the year in a few percentage points. So there's a margin for error on this that probably puts this all in about the same place. I think fundamentally, the way they talk about segments from what I understand was, around memory, with DRAM strength, NAND flash strength in the year. We think we see a little bit more logic strength at least around our business. And, foundry looks like it'll be down some.","So add it all up, you end up in this mid 5%, 7% type single digit growth rates. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in DRAM in terms of adoption from a process control intensity perspective. You have more logic in the devices, you also have the dynamics that are happening in China that are good for process control adoption intensity as well. So I think one of the good - really strong stories about the company right now, given the improvements we've seen in intensity is to have a year that is this strong around memory and have the company in a position to perform at least in line with the market and at least as the way we wanted, perhaps a little bit better. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing across all segments and I think there's opportunities for us to solve unique problems, given the technology transitions that are in front of us.","C.J. Muse","And I guess as my follow up, as you think about second half rise in shipment and I guess I'm making the assumption, correct me if I'm wrong that logic foundry will be greater percentage there, which I would think would deliver upside to gross margin. So should we be contemplating an uplift to gross margins through the year for you guys.","Bren Higgins","So I think the way you're modeling it in terms of the segment mix half to half is right. I mean, it's still pretty strong memory through the course of the year, but foundry logic does pick up in to the second half. I think, one of the wildcards in the year is the order profile into the December quarter and in that time frame is pretty strong around foundry. So depending on when those orders actually materialize, that there's a pull in, does that create opportunity at the end of the year to ship those tools or not. Right now, we haven't slotted the way that we do with these four orders in Q4.","So around gross margins, our gross margin profile across the different segments is not any different. The way that the company delivers value - we share value with customers, the ROI is understood, the pricing is very consistent and so sometimes mix of products changes a little bit, but I'm modeling gross margin consistent with the prepared remarks, the bias to the higher end of the range of 63% to 64% that I mentioned. And over the course of the year, movement within the quarters will be driven largely by some smaller product mix issues here and there, but I expect most quarters to be operating in and around the range I mentioned in the prepared remarks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok","Just a fall question on China. I think some of your peers is talking kind of increased spending from the domestic memory chip makers now and I think historically an investor base be that that will be very possible for KLA. I'm just curious where do we stand on that? Do you have any update in terms of the cadence of that spending? Are we seeing a strong pickup this year or it's really more like '19.","Bren Higgins","Yes. So it's been a good segment of business for us. China, as a region, as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw a tripling of native China bookings in calendar '17 versus calendar '16. Those orders tend to come with longer lead times, given the nature of not just new fabs, but also new fabs and new locations. So there's always infrastructure and other requirements that are part of the equation to get something up and running. As we look at calendar '18, I don't see any change in momentum.","I think the mix shifts a little bit, where it was more 50-50 memory foundry in calendar '17. Again, this is from an order perspective, calendar '18 seems a little bit more foundry heavy. But the contribution roughly in the same in the same range. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and as these projects come up to speed and they start to make progress, I think that's going to influence the timing of the next round or next phases of investment that happen over the coming years. But what's in front of us looks pretty good.","Edwin Mok","Just to be really clear, so you're basically not kind of low single digit growth does not factor in comp growth in China and it sounds like you expect a kind of similar level, but a mix shift there. Is that correct?","Bren Higgins","You know what, we'll ship more in '17 than we shipped in '16. My commentary was focused on the order mix. So yeah, there's more contribution from China in terms of shipment and revenue, native China in the calendar '18 numbers than there was in calendar '17.","Edwin Mok","And then my follow-up question is on the pattern wafer inspection market, it's really strong right now, but historically the business tend to be more, they go bigger cycle. Is there anything structurally changed for that market that give you confident that demand is sustainable?","Bren Higgins","A couple of things have. I think, it is true first of all that those businesses happen to be very strong when there is a reinvestment cycle, but there's a couple of - and to new technology and that can be driven by a couple of things, but one of the - volume of course drives and the other one is when there are new specs relative to, particularly based on design rules. The other thing we're seeing is the flatness market growing, an acquisition we did years ago is doing very well inside the bare wafer market to measure wafer flatness and that's being driven a lot by additional requirements, driven in part by 3D NAND. And so we're seeing new specs, driving new tool purchases in addition to the traditional drivers of volume and sensitivity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.","Romit Shah","I just had one question for you, Rick. It just seems like as demand for AI and server\/ high performance computing hardware inflects the size of the silicon that powers that functionality is also growing at a fairly tremendous rate. Nvidia's got a V100 GPU that they say has north of 20 billion transistors. And so the byproduct of that is that you've got these very high performance CPEs and GPEs, but the yields are not great. And it would seem like the implication here is that demand for top tier process control equipment should be stronger benefit from this trend and I was hoping you could talk about that.","Rick Wallace","Sure. Yes, absolutely. One of the main drivers is the push for AI and also the high performance computing just in general as a category and we are seeing and it plays really on a couple of places for us. One, it drives additional designs, which drives mask, which drives our mask business. So we are seeing benefit. And then in the fab, the additional complexity of those very advanced chips drives everything about complexity, including defectivity requirements because a larger die and also the metrology requirements associated with it. So it is a positive inflection for us overall and it is going to be a multiple foundries as well, not just in one. So there are other players in that. So we expect that to be something that continues to drive the need for process control as we go forward.","Romit Shah","Is it fair to say that this trend, as it accelerates is good for your blended ASPs and then consequently your gross margins over time.","Rick Wallace","Well, certainly the percentage of tooling as Bren mentioned, we're not really customer dependent on gross margin as we are mix, but as the process gets more complex, the mix of customer use case tends to go toward the more advanced tools. So sure, we would see a benefit in terms of our overall profitability and business level based on advanced devices of any kind, pushing demand forward. So yes, absolutely it's a driver for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.","Patrick Ho","Rick, in terms of memory capital intensity, you've talked about in the past how 3-D NAND and a lot of the manufacturing challenges there has helped increase process control intensity. I know, we're at the early ramp of the new 64-layer devices that we're seeing in the marketplace, but as we go to 96 and 128, are the increases in layer going to continue to help in capital intensity or have we kind of just reached maybe a leveling at this time? I think you said you've gain one or two percentage process control intensity points with the 3-D transition. How do you look at it as we go to more layers?","Rick Wallace","Great question and the answer is there is more opportunity. And there's two ways for us to address that. One is continued and even more deployment of existing tools, which I don't think would drive intensity significantly higher, if that's all we do, but we do have new tools in the pipeline to address 3D NAND and when those come online and they're going to be in support of these advanced technologies, then we can actually drive increased adoption based on new use cases. There are more problems in 3D NAND metrology and defectivity than we can solve right now. And if we can bring the new tools out and get those in and those are something that we're targeting for in the next 12 to 24, having starting to make an impact on the market. So yeah, that will drive intensity up.","Patrick Ho","Great. And a question for Bren in terms of managing supply chain, obviously yourself and the rest of the equipment industry, you're seeing record demand today and you've been able to turn around tools at a pretty rapid rate, even as demand trends continue to rise. You're also managing your inventories and AR really well. What have you done over the last couple of quarters, especially as you've seen this rise in demand and your ability to continue to I guess deliver to the customers, given their kind of strict and tight timelines for tool deliveries.","Bren Higgins","Yeah. Well, it hasn't been easy. A lot of heavy lifting by the operational teams to execute in this environment. I mean, one of the things that we've done I think pretty effectively across all of our products is to do a lot more hedging of long lead time materials, whether we're buying supplier long lead time materials or we're buying our - the assembled parts and that shortens the lead time and gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to deliver. So that certainly is one of the things we're doing. I mean obviously, we're making stronger commitments further out in some cases to be able to make sure we've got the supplier ramping their capacity to be able to support us.","So a lot of tactical things there to be able to deliver that. We're spending some time sometimes, sending our own guys out to work with our suppliers to improve their processes to deliver better yields of parts and so on to be able to meet our needs. So a lot of small things there. Like everybody else, we're putting a lot of pressure on the chain. Some of our suppliers are unique and supply only to us in this space. So that helps in some cases, but it's a challenge, but so far we're doing okay with it and I'm really pleased with the leverage and the operational execution in the factories across the world for us.","Operator","Your final question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup.","Atif Malik","Rick, I have a question on your foundry opportunity. TSMC on its earnings call talked about a flattish CapEx, with capital intensity longer term coming down from low to - 20% to 30% for them. Within that declining capital intensity, can you just talk about how do you see PDC opportunity for you? I assume EUV opportunity is obviously growing within that CapEx, but just talk about the PDC opportunity for you guys? And then I have a follow-up.","Rick Wallace","Sure. I think that the foundry capital intensity ranges depending on where we are in the cycle and the customer, but it's somewhere in the order of 15% to 17%. We see upside to that, if we can provide more capability as we discussed earlier in 3D NAND. There are problems that are unsolved in terms of foundry and especially as we get to EUV. So we think that'll head toward the high end of that range. And customers of course are going to try to optimize their investment and try to minimize their investment in capital and in process control. So we're constantly showing that we have created value for them and then we share that value in terms of the way we deploy in the market. So I think as we're modeling it forward, it continues to be in that 15% to 17% range.","Atif Malik","Great. And then Bren, are you expecting your logic plus foundry opportunity this year to be flattish over last year, like prior comments or has there been a change to that.","Bren Higgins","As I look at it and I look at the breadth of customers investing across foundry and as more of a shipment statement, I think the foundry shipments are probably down a little bit. So I think our expectations would be around foundry, as I said earlier, we're - foundry down a little bit, logic up, DRAM strong and NAND obviously strong as well. So that's how you get to the guidance we provided for WC.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks.","Ed Lockwood","Okay.

I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, Chief Financial Officer; and Bren Higgins, Vice President, Finance and Prospective Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time.","If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.

Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results.","More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. Given that we've provided a thorough update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then, Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials. Let's begin with a quick review of the quarter.","Gross bookings in June were $713 million, down slightly from the March quarter. June quarter revenue was roughly flat compared with March at $720 million, coming in above the midpoint of the range of guidance. The non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.82 in Q4, also above the midpoint of guidance. Cash flow from operations was $176 million in Q4, and we were active in returning value to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 1.3 million shares in the quarter for $68 million. For the full year in fiscal 2013, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total of $273 million and paid dividends of $266 million. And finally, as we announced on July 9, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. This is the fifth increase in the quarterly dividend level since it was first instituted in 2005 and reflects management and the board's confidence in the long-term outlook for the company, as well as our ongoing efforts to reward our stockholders for their continued investment.","Our performance in Q4 highlights the continuation of the trend of market technology and business model leadership for KLA-Tencor, as the increase in cost and complexity associated with managing yields makes process control increasingly more critical to our customers' success. Against this backdrop, KLA-Tencor is successfully executing our long-term strategic objectives and delivering strong stockholder returns.","Turning now to our view of the current business environment. The Q4 bookings profile for KLA-Tencor was highlighted by order strength from memory customers. Memory accounted for 44% of gross bookings in June with several customers delivering upside to their original order forecast in the quarter. We expect memory orders to grow to 55% of our bookings in September with orders to support a large new fab project comprising a significant portion of the mix. We're also experiencing more breadth of demand among DRAM customers to support technology transitions and growth in mobile DRAM.","Memory customers are facing increasingly more complex yield challenges at the leading edge, and as a result, we expect to see higher relative adoption of process control and strengthening market share for KLA-Tencor in leading-edge memory, as customers continue to advance their technology roadmaps. Foundry accounted for 33% of new orders in the June quarter. We expect foundry to comprise approximately 35% of September bookings with demand spread across a broad base of customers and focused on ramping leading-edge devices. Because foundries tend to have the highest adopter -- adoption of process control, the sustained level of foundry investment we are experiencing is favorable to KLA-Tencor and a key driver to our market leadership and strong financial performance.","Finally, bookings from logic customers represented 23% of new orders in June, driven by continued migration to 14 nanometer. In keeping with our expectation for logic demand to be concentrated in the first half of calendar 2013, bookings from logic customers are anticipated to decline to 10% of the mix in September.","Now for some additional perspective on the demand picture for the remaining of the calendar year. We noted at SEMICON West, we expect order levels to strengthen modestly in the second half of 2013 with sustained strong demand from foundries and the growth in memory offsetting a weaker outlook for logic. This is consistent with our view for industry CapEx to be down in the range of 5% to 10% and total revenue for KLA-Tencor to be down in the range of 8% to 10% for calendar 2013. Looking ahead to calendar 2014, although it's too early to quantify with any detail, we're aligned with the widely held view that the 2014 year will be strong for the industry and have significant industry growth, as the factors, which have sustained the high level of CapEx investment in the cycles, remain in place with mobility markets fueling a rapid pace of innovation in next-generation semiconductor devices and driving growth for the market leaders.","Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We expect September bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $750 million. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $620 million to $680 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.73 in the quarter. With our strong shipment revenue backlog levels and our anticipated order growth in the December quarter, we expect revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar 2013.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers.","Mark P. Dentinger","Good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions; restructuring-related charges and credits; and any costs or credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.02 after tax difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.","Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.","Q4 new orders were $713 million, down from the $738 million in Q3. Q4 net orders were $705 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. 38% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 17% in the March quarter; Europe was 6% of new systems orders, down from 17% in Q3; Japan was 12%, up from 9% last quarter; Korea was 10%, even with last quarter; Taiwan was 10%, down from 35% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 24%, up from 12% in Q3. The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 54% compared with 51% last quarter; reticle inspection was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 20% in Q3; our non-semi businesses were 2%, down from 3% last quarter; and service was 21% of new orders in Q4, up slightly from 20% in Q3. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 33% of new systems orders in Q4 were from foundry customers compared with 47% in Q3; Logic customers were 23% of new orders in Q4, down from 25% in Q3; and memory orders were 44% in Q4 versus 28% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q1 fiscal 2014 will be within the range of $600 million to $750 million.","In Q4, we shipped $769 million, up from $694 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $620 million and $680 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased slightly from the end of March, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in systems backlog. Backlog at June 30, 2013, included $271 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $817 million in system orders that have not yet shipped.","Total revenue for Q4 was $720 million, down about 1% from $729 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q4 was $570 million, down about $10 million from last quarter, and services revenue was $150 million, roughly even with Q3. Our expectation for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $620 million and $680 million.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.8% this quarter, approximately flat with 57.9% from last quarter. For Q1, we are expecting gross margins between 56% and 57.5%. Operating expenses were $223 million in Q4, up $10 million from the $213 million we posted in Q3. Part of the quarterly net expense increase was attributable to a decrease in reimbursements under our direct write lithography program. More specifically, a $4 million milestone payment, which we had been expected in Q4, is now expected in Q1. Consequently, we anticipate net operating expenses in Q1 will be down slightly from Q4 to a range between $218 million and $222 million.","OIE was a net $10.5 million expense in Q4, up slightly from the net expense of $10.1 million in Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of about $10.5 million in Q1.","In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $44 million or 24% of pretax income versus the 14% rate in Q3. The unusually low Q3 rate was mostly related to reinstatement of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit in January. As we move forward, we are forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of about 23% for fiscal 2014 based upon the anticipated distribution of next year's earnings. The actual rate could differ, especially quarter-to-quarter. But under our current structure, we believe 23% is the midpoint in a range of outcomes, and we have used 23% in our Q1 non-GAAP EPS guidance.","Non-GAAP net income was $139 million or $0.82 per share in Q4. At the revenue range I've previously mentioned in applying a tax rate of 23%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.53 and $0.73 per share. Weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q4 was 168.7 million versus 169.2 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of June 30, 2013, we had approximately 5.9 million shares available under our current authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about 168.6 million for Q1. We also paid $66 million in dividends in Q4. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share in Q1.","On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.9 billion, up $39 million from March 31. Cash generated from operations was $176 million in Q4 compared with $415 million in Q3. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in cash flow from operations was largely attributable to $155 million decrease in customer collections, as well as higher outlays for trade payables, income taxes and interest on our debt.","Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $525 million, up from $454 million at the end of March. DSO was 66 days at June 30 versus 57 days at March 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories were $634 million at June 30, down slightly from $650 million at the end of March. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 1.9 turns in Q4, the same as Q3. Capital expenditures were $19 million in Q4, up slightly from $18 million in Q3. Full-time headcount at June 30 was 5,821 versus 5,838 at March 31. We expect our headcount to remain about flat in Q1.","In summary, our guidance for Q1 is new orders between $600 million and $750 million, total revenue between $620 million and $680 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.53 and $0.73 per share, applying a 23% tax rate. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open your call up to questions. [Operator Instructions] So Jay, we're ready for your first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of Satya. Just wanted to understand your expectations for the full year revenue a little better. It seems like you are down ticking the revenues for this year to be somewhat underperforming the WFE. So just wanted to understand like what's driving that change.","Richard P. Wallace","All right, I'm going to let Bren take that one.","Bren Higgins","So I think when you look at the second half view, which is essentially consistent with what we said at SEMICON of $1.5 billion in orders, and you flow that through our backlog number and then take the revenue guidance for this quarter, it does lead you to this calendar year view of the calendar revenue down 8% to 10%, so roughly consistent with our expectations for the industry of down somewhere between 5% and 10%. But that's how, as we bottoms up the revenue this quarter to come up with the $650 million and then flow through our backlog model into the December quarter. So that's how the math works.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then thinking about 2014, it seems like 2013, just based on what you're saying for the second half, the memory shipments seem to be up quite a bit. And for -- that could be one reason may be why you're not doing as well as the WFE this year. How should we think about 2014? How do you think relative to the WFE, what do you expect should process control and inspection in KLA be up next year? Or do you think it will be down?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, certainly, we see the memory mix being probably strongest in the quarter that just finished and the September quarter. For us, we see memory kind of reverting back to historical norms than the December time frame, and next year, I think the large -- the expected increase in the overall market will be driven by the traditional drivers of late, which are the logic and foundry, both of which are going to be good for KLA-Tencor. So we think 2014 should be a good year for us and for process control.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Rick, you said at SEMICON that you thought orders were going to be about $1.5 billion during the back half. So if I just take the midpoint of September, that implies you're like $875 million or up 30% sequentially in Q4. Is that sort of the way to think about it?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, Tim, no change to our view of what we think the rest of calendar '13 looks like.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as you assess maybe some of the stuff going on with respect to your exposure to 3D and to FinFET, as more of that stuff shifts next year, can you again sort of remind us how to think about your exposure to your 3D NAND relative to FinFET? So if we were to try to assume what sort of an impact that might have on your ability to outgrow the industry next year, those 2 factors?","Richard P. Wallace","I think 2014, we will expect to see some 3D NAND, and as we mentioned, we have, we believe, a good position, very good market position when it comes to serving that market, and we do see growth off historical levels for that. And I think there is also a period of investment now basically playing catch-up a little bit on the memory side. So memory will be at a higher level of intensity than it's been in the past driven by that but not as high as it would be if it were a pure foundry and logic. So we kind of go back to the historical -- we think next year looks a little bit more like the 70-30 split in logic and foundry and the 70% in memory on 30% with intensity going up in both.","Bren Higgins","Tim, it's Bren. Just one other thing, so on the order outlook, so at $1.5 billion, if you take the midpoint of the Q1 guidance, that puts the December quarter nominally around $825 million, so up about 20%, up 30% would be a little bit higher than what we see today. So largely unchanged from -- or essentially the same as what we saw at SEMICON.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a 2-part question. Number one, on the revenue guidance, it seems a little weaker than expected. Is it partly because some of these memory bookings you made is scheduled for shipment in calendar Q4 or later? And the second question I had is, since your kind of visibility into current [ph] -- the December quarter bookings, how would that mix look like if memory comes down? Are you expecting foundry to come in a big way to pick up the slack in December?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, Krish, this is Rick. I'll take Part 2 and then give Bren Part 1. We do see the mix reverting back to the 70-30 mix we talked about at SEMICON West in the December quarter, memory being 30%, most of that, actually, being in the NAND space, as we get out to December. And so logic, we'd see some pickup in logic and foundry to comprise the rest of what we see for the rest of the year. And then Bren can take the revenue for Q1 comment.","Bren Higgins","So Krish, on the revenue guide, so there are a couple of ways to model it from a top-down perspective, but when we give the guidance, what we do is we build it up, bottoms up, tool by tool. And in some cases, you have tools that have acceptance cycles that we have to go all the way to product acceptance to take revenue, which impacts timing. And then other tools, sometimes you can take that revenue in shipment. So as we build it up and go through that process and look at it, we come out at about $650 million. So when you look at the overall model, lead times are still roughly what they've been. We're averaging about 4 months from order to shipment and about 1.5 months in terms of shipment to revenue. So that's how it works. So sometimes, you can end up with some disconnects from a top down versus bottoms up. But as we build it up for the current quarter, which is our process, that's where we end up.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of the Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, you mentioned memory intensity is going up. Can you talk about your expectations of process control intensity in the memory sector as you look into the next couple of quarters? And how much of the impact on revenue could be attributed to share shifts? I mean, in other words, can you say that your overall market share this year is going to be flat, up, down versus last year?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. Let me start with the memory question. What we laid out at SEMICON, and we have no reason to change it now, is memory intensity at the 4X node we saw about -- in aggregate -- about 8.8%. With it going to 9.3% -- this is process control intensity and memory at 2X and 10.2% on the 1X. And so what we're seeing now is depending on who's buying that increase in [ph] intensity, but it's -- that averaged over time. And what happens is much is the same in the case with logic or foundry, you see it may be heavier at the beginning of a ramp and lightening up as you go later into a ramp. So there are some increased buying. There are some increased buying now because at the beginning of some new fab activity and new ramps. That's part of why we're seeing a heavier concentration of memory right now. But over time, we think it normalizes to those percentages that we laid out. And the other question was on share. Our expectation, we just did the analysis. We finished our fiscal year. We looked back, and we did not see a meaningful change in market share in terms of dollar spent on process control for KLA-Tencor as a percent of what we noted the overall spend. And as we look forward, we don't anticipate any change in that, in our plans for the upcoming fiscal year. And we do think there are actually some opportunities for share improvement.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rick, just wondering if you could share your view on how much you think 2014 WFE spending should be up. Are you kind of estimating at least double-digit growth? And then do you think foundry CapEx spending will be up again next year?","Richard P. Wallace","As you know, Stephen, it's really hard to predict. I went back in time, and I was looking at August predictions, and well, it was a bad year to pick it. But 2008 and some of the leading equipment companies were saying 2009 was going to be up 10%. That didn't happen as you recall. So I think the perils of long-term forecasting are still with us. But assuming there's no macroeconomic changes, we do see '14 looking better primarily driven by the transition toward that 20\/16-nanometer nodes in the foundry section continue to invest in logic and memory returning to maybe more historical levels of investment driven by some of the activities in the VNAND and the better pricing in DRAM. So all in all, we're kind of sitting with the rest of the industry in terms of industry consensus on what we think '14 will look like. We think we're going to start seeing some of that increased activity, as we said, in the December quarter, supporting what we believe will be a pretty good year in 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, you talked quite a bit at the SEMICON on the competitive front on what's going on. I mean, there is, of course, a lot of talk about the market share movements. Can you update us a little bit more on brightfield inspection? You talked about that we're at the trailing-edge [indiscernible], and there is some movement. As we see the 20-nanometer orders, are we going to see a big pickup in your share in terms of brightfield inspection?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. Let me start with the one of things that was brought to my attention as we were reviewing last year. We had a record shipment year for brightfield in our fiscal 2013, so all-time record for the fiscal year. And as we look forward for 2014, our fiscal '14 starting now, we see continued opportunity for brightfield as we look at some of the challenges being faced by customers in the 20- and 16-nanometer transitions and also some of the activity that's going on, as I said, the renewed investment going on in memory. So we feel very good about our position there and think we'll continue to show strength. And as I mentioned, the NanoPoint discussion that we had at SEMICON West, we're actually seeing more positive examples of that coming out even as recently in the last couple of weeks with customers, so feel very good about our position in the broadband inspection of brightfield.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one quick follow-up on the memory, I think you mentioned, but I'm not sure that I got exactly. Can you tell us that, in terms of in the memory, how is the composition between DRAM and NAND changing from June quarter to September to December quarter?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we had -- in June, it was about 60% of the memory was for NAND, and it looks to be about that for September. I don't actually have it modeled for the December quarter at this point but roughly, 60-40 for NAND versus DRAM, which is good to see DRAM actually investing at that level. It had been much higher in the past, and -- but there is some catch-up going on in DRAM.","Operator","The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Rick, I have a rather philosophical question. When I talk to technologies, both in the memory and also logic, the guys who are in the field, they're actually doing the design for circuit chip or working on the process technology. I hear conflicting things on the sense that, as was captured last night by Cadence Design, there are just not a whole lot of design activity. And if I were to assume that EDA companies are leading indicator, they're not seeing a whole lot of volume until 2015. And when I talked to technologies on the NAND side, nobody sees commercialization of 3D NAND until '15 or '16. So I want to hear your opinion as to what gives the confidence that in this kind of environment, CapEx next year could be really great.","Richard P. Wallace","All right. Well, in terms of the investment -- let me start with the second one. What we've seen on 3D, people are absolutely building fabs, ordering equipment and talking about need for increased stability to support those RAMs [ph]. Those are the signals that we're getting and some of the business that we got in the June quarter and we expect to get the next 2 quarters is in support of that. And there's a lot of activity in terms of people moving to support that, customers, multiple customers making investment there. So whether or not there's a demand for it, I actually have heard differing views that there is actually a pretty strong demand for the 3D coming from some new consumer markets and the challenge, I think, will be to ramp and meet that on the new technology. And that's -- we're feeling that pressure to support those ramps right now. So it's as real as any kind of ramp pressure that I've felt in the past -- people wanting, customers wanting very explicit support plans because sometimes they're in new locations. In terms of the FinFET, I do think that the question of how long the 20-nanometer node lasts is a very good question. And we are seeing some evidence that there are customers that are going to skip to 16 and 14 because they feel that either that they're not necessarily going to benefit enough from going to 20, and they're going to move beyond that. I don't know that the mix is going to be incredibly high initially. I think that there are probably not as many starts, so maybe there's some -- that, that may be somewhat consistent that it's a limited number of devices on those. But that is not atypical for a new node ramp. So we are definitely hearing very similar conversations from customers. The ones that are later in the process of 28 nanometers, I think will come later. But the ones that are further along and are in their 20-nanometer, maybe higher volume at this point are definitely pushing us toward preparing for the next generation. So it may be true, but it's certainly not the signs. In fact, I'd say that the memory thing has surprised us in terms of how much investment is going in, in some cases, to brick and mortar to prepare for what they believe is a strong customer demand.","Operator","The next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Summit Research.","Srinivasan Sundararajan","Rick, this is Srini and just wanted to ask you as to whether you see any differences between the FinFET in the 28-nanometer node and maybe in the 14-nanometer node or the 20-nanometer node. What are the differences as you go down in the node size?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, the differences for us, so I'm not a device physicist, so I'm not going to be able to tell you the differences in terms of challenges performance wise, but -- or leakage wise. But what we're definitely seeing is 28-nanometer in some customers is much more mature than others. So I would start by saying that there are some customers much further along on the yield curve. There are others, by the way, who are still struggling with the yield on 28 and working very hard, and we're seeing good opportunity from those customers who try to get them up and yielding. On the next generation, I think that the tolerances are all very, very tight for people. So we're seeing a strong push toward next-generation inspection and measurement tools from us to be able to handle the increased, I guess, process and tolerance if you will. And that's what's driving us right now. We have very tough specs coming from customers that are going down that path, and it's resulting in us having to sell our latest generation equipment to serve that. So I think it's a refresh cycle. The things that -- or the products that we're going to make to support 16 and 14 are going to be the leading edge that we have now. I think they'll be very little of the trailing edge in those nodes on those critical layers because the requirements are just too high but from a defectivity standpoint and a metrology standpoint.","Operator","The next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering real quickly, you had mentioned there you see some opportunities for share improvement, and I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail. I know that in the past you mentioned that NanoPoint might help with potentially some e-Beam review traction. But is that one of those opportunities? And are there others that you might like to highlight?","Richard P. Wallace","I think we've got some pretty good opportunities. I mentioned NanoPoint. I think we have some good opportunities in terms of films. And actually, it might be surprising, but I think there are some good opportunities in reticle, and that's an area where, historically, we had some strong share, has not been quite as strong recently partly because we've been toward the end of -- not end, but we're in a mass-maker holiday a bit, not pushing mass technology as much as you do double and quad patterning. And some of the new challenges on some of the advanced reticles are, once again, taxing technology and really play to our strength as technology leaders. And so we think there's a reasonable likelihood we'll actually see share gain in reticle as reticle starts investing again as we go forward. Also, we found some customers recently that felt that they had strategies where they could limit their adoption of reticle potentially even in the fab, and they've had -- been burned by some problems recently, and they're coming to us for some solutions. So we feel pretty good about the opportunities there.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. That's helpful. And then just on the NanoPoint piece, you mentioned some good revenue growth opportunity, and I'm wondering how NanoPoint plays into that in terms of the revenue from it being an add-on option versus it driving incremental demand in e-Beam and brightfield.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. I wouldn't stress the revenue from NanoPoint as much. I think that what NanoPoint does is it creates additional value, so we talked a lot about it at West in terms of what it was doing for brightfield, and I just mentioned earlier on the call, when we tallied up FY '13 and just finished, we had a record year in brightfield for the -- all-time record for the company. And I know that part of that was driven by some of the adoption of NanoPoint. And when it comes to e-Beam, it's more substitutional. I think there are some customers that -- and this is part of what's driving it with brightfield is that they were feeling that some of the defects that they were looking for, they could only really find them with e-Beam. And even though e-Beam had incredibly slow throughput, that was the only thing they could do. And with NanoPoint, to a number of those customers, we demonstrated the ability to leverage a much, much faster brightfield tool in conjunction with NanoPoint to take over those inspection points. And I think the result is more adoption for brightfield and frankly squeezing some of the opportunities that e-Beam had been seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Rick, 2 questions. First, given the intensity of edge and deposition steps in 3D NAND and yields unproven, how would you characterize that yield ramp? Is it you have a foundry ramp that you have seen where people have stumbled on 28 nanometer? I'd like to get your thoughts on the yield RAM [ph]. And how incremental would be the opportunity on 3D versus 2D NAND? And I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. I think that one thing I did learn more about, I'd say, since West is that -- SEMICON West, is it does appear that there's prettier progress being made by some leading customers on VNAND and I think that it does create opportunity. So I think some of the question about will their investment materialize, I think it's -- there's some evidence to suggest that they're making progress and it's creating a lot of opportunity for us because a lot of the help we're being asked to provide is to assist in those RAMs [ph]. So I think we're past maybe some of the parametric challenges and into actual defectivity. So I think a pretty good opportunity, although it's a different challenge process-wise, so we don't really know yet what we don't know in terms of how our customers are going to use the tools. So we're seeing good opportunity there. And I think that relative to 2D, it's just different because it uses some different technologies to get at the high-aspect ratio structures. And you had a follow-on?","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, I have a follow-on. So how should we be thinking about your logic orders in calendar '13 versus calendar '12 in terms of is there going to be any year-over-year improvement in that segment? Can you give us some clarity on that?","Richard P. Wallace","For calendar '13 -- yes, we're not really modeling out as much as we finish the calendar year. That'd be forecasting more into December than, I think, we're comfortable doing. But I don't think we see -- in average, not a big change.","Bren Higgins","Down probably a little bit at this point, but again, a lot that -- a lot of time to cover here before we get to the end of the year.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Because the reason was that one of your customers are -- key customer's going to start ramping 14 nanometer, and I just wanted to get the magnitude of how we should be thinking about it.","Richard P. Wallace","Right.","Bren Higgins","We had a strong first half in logic, so -- and we tend to get longer lead times in logic, so that certainly supported the first half of the year. So expect it down a little bit in the second half but on the strong first half.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just to follow-up on a prior question, can you just discuss the inspection challenges associated with 3D NAND? I've heard that it's incredibly more difficult to inspect these devices because the way they're built. Can you just discuss whether in fact the -- these chips or this 3D NAND can be inspected?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, they can be inspected. It's different though because now we're looking in a vertical direction. So part of that attraction of 3D NAND is you can back off the dimensions, so you're not printing -- the lines and spaces aren't as small, but they're going vertical. So instead of just looking for smaller and smaller defects, which would push, in one axis, the performance, you're actually looking for defects in the vertical direction, which pushes another axis. Fortunately, our tools have enough flexibility in them to be tuned to do those kinds of inspections. And then there's the review challenge, and then there's the corrective action. So we are finding, as we work with our customers, that we're able to create methodologies with them that help them address some of these defectivity challenges. But they're just different than what you would see if you were just in straight, linear scaling on a 2D device.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just a second question, quickly, just what are your expectations for timing of sort of 16-nanometer FinFET or 14-nanometer FinFET from the foundries in terms of spending there?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we expect to start seeing investment toward the end of the calendar year, and then, I think throughout 2014, there should be continued investment as the leaders are followed by other close -- fast followers behind them. We'll see continued investment through the year in '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So first question on the memory customers, right? I think you mentioned that you're seeing a broadening of customer spending. But at the same time, I take your commentary on the back half and how it imply for the fourth quarter, you kind of imply your memory order could potentially be down even though you have one big customer that plans around [ph] a new fab. Can you help reconcile those for me?","Richard P. Wallace","Our lead times tend to be longer than others.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I see. I see. So basically, a lot of orders already come in right now in the horizon [ph]?","Richard P. Wallace","We talked about it being strong in September as well.","Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I see. Okay, that's fair. And then one quick question on gross margin. This quarter goes on and came in above your guidance range, and I remember last quarter was something due to the revenue, timing of revenue that allows you guys to have stronger margin. What happened this quarter? And why are you guiding for September gross margin go back to that 56% to 57.5% range?","Bren Higgins","I think, incremental gross margins in Q4 were pretty consistent with our model at about 67%. So revenue was largely flat, and as you know, with our products, we always end up with a fair amount of puts and takes around the mix. But with mix being sort of largely flat in the quarter from our guidance, we ended up with a little bit better factory utilization on the stronger output in the second half, and service and warranty and things like that were favorable as well. That's how we got the incremental point from the guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question in terms of the R&D spend, the tick-up a bit this quarter. First, in terms of -- is there any -- can you give a little bit of granularity in terms of where that spending may have been targeted whether it's for $450 million or just for continued product development? And secondly, how do you expect it to trend at least in the first half of the year, calendar year of next year?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Patrick, so I've been saying for a while that the OpEx range was going to be somewhere between $215 million and $220 million, and we've been bouncing around within that range. Programmatic swings have caused it to be a little bit under. in the last couple of quarters, it has been, but there was always sort of this possibility that it could be over that, too. We guided about $218 million, $219 million back in April. We came in at $223 million, but as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a milestone related to a cost-sharing plan we have with the government that slipped out of the quarter. So that drove this incremental $4 million or so from our guidance. As we look out going forward, I think we're probably, as we size our FY '14 based on our expectations here around the second half of the calendar year and in an improving environment in the calendar '14, we're sizing that company somewhere around $880 million, let's say, plus or minus $10 million. So works out in that range of around $220 million or so a quarter. But we could have some fluctuation here and there around it. You mentioned $450 million. $450 million is in the number. We've been pretty consistent in terms of our expectations around that spending. It's roughly be between $50 million and $60 million a quarter that we're -- or $50 million to $60 million for the year that we're going to spend, and that's largely the same as what we saw last year as well. So no incremental uptick related to $450 million in our plans at least over the next 12 months.","Operator","The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Rick, I just wanted to ask another question here. I was just looking at your memory order guidance for September, and you're going to be back up to peak absolute memory order levels, back into 2007 type of dollar numbers. And back then, there was a lot of capacity added by the industry. I know that this time, it's a bit different because this is a new technology. It's going to actually take it time to ramp. But there's this prevailing wisdom that it's going to be so different this time. And I guess, it just seems to sort of fly in the face of that, particularly given your commentary that maybe there's another company in Korea that's actually readying plans to build out 3D as well. So can you just maybe, from just a super high level, talk about how the memory companies are acting this time and if it really is going to be a lot different?","Richard P. Wallace","Tim, you would have noticed that, that's [ph] level memory. Well done. We're noticing that, too. This one's a little different though because I think it's front-end loaded at the beginning of a fab ramp with new technology. So there's no reuse really because there's nothing -- the product mix that we have for dealing with the new technology is all new. So there's no ability for people to reuse. But it is largely, for us, going to be front-end loaded towards the beginning of a ramp. So that's why we see it reverting to normal back in the -- or more traditional 30%-ish in the December quarter, but that's really what that's related to. We could and we believe we will see, as other companies come on line, additional opportunity for us but again, likely front-end loaded and probably, over time, reverting to the process control intensities for memory that we saw that we outlined at West. Now the one difference is we don't really know yet what 3D problems customers are going to have, and I don't believe they know yet just how much process control they're going to need. So it looks like a good beginning, but we may be being a bit conservative on the opportunity there as we go forward.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Ted Lockwood","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time.","If you haven't seen the release, you'll find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","More information, including factors that could cause those differences, is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web.","I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone. I will lead off the call today with summary highlights in Q1 and the current business environment, and then provide guidance for the December quarter. Then Bren will follow with more details on the results.","Q1 2014 was a good quarter for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating our market leadership, the strength of our core markets and process control and solid operational execution. New orders in Q1 grew 11% sequentially to $790 million, above the range of guidance and setting a new record for total bookings for the company in the September quarter.","We experienced good momentum in order activity in the quarter, and demand was strong across each of our end markets, highlighted by record memory customer bookings in Q1. Bookings activity was also robust in foundry, where we witnessed pull-in orders to support 20-nanometer development. The solid demand affirms our ongoing focus on providing superior value to customers, both in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. In fact, a key contributor to our strong bookings performance in Q1 was the success of new products, particularly with memory customers, with whom, we achieved quick acceptance of our latest generation plasma inspection tools, as well as a key mask inspection win.","With the increasing cost and complexity associated with leading-edge memory, we are seeing higher adoption of process control for memory customers, a trend we believe will continue to benefit KLA-Tencor over time given our market leadership position in that field.","As we look ahead to the December quarter and into 2014, we expect continued strong order momentum, high levels of business activity with our customers. And we believe this sets the stage for a positive calendar year 2014 for demand and capital equipment industry overall, and for process control in particular, giving the increasing importance the process control is playing in helping our customers achieve their growth and cost objectives at the leading edge.","With KLA-Tencor's strong backlog, our market position and the forecasted growth of the segments in which we participate, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to successfully execute our strategies to deliver superior growth and financial performance relative to our industry and return significant value to stockholders.","Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect the strong demand environment to continue as momentum for new technology development continues to strengthen across multiple customers. We're encouraged by the pace of this investment and how well we are positioned with new products to address this increasing cost and complexities that are associated with competing at the leading edge.","Now for guidance for the December quarter. December bookings are expected to increase approximately 10% at the midpoint and be in a range of $800 million to $950 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $670 million and $730 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.67 to $0.87 per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. This was a solid quarter for KLA-Tencor in terms of financial performance and operational execution. Revenue for Q1 was $658 million. Fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.66. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68. In our press release, you'll find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments covered in the press release.","As Rick mentioned, Q1 results are highlighted by new orders finishing above the upper end of the range of guidance at $790 million, with our order forecast for both Q1 and for Q2 strengthening as we progressed through the quarter. Memory investment is focused on 3D technology development and new capacity in NAND and technology upgrades in the DRAM. Foundry demand in Q1 was stronger than expected with upside to our original forecast coming from pull-in orders to support 20-nanometer development and pilot activity. We see foundry orders increasing in Q2, with ramp in investment in 20-nanometer and strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving order growth.","The regional distribution in new system orders and quarter-to-quarter change was: the U.S. was 22%, down from 38% in the June quarter; Europe was 8%, up from 6%; Japan was 10%, down from 12%; Korea was 18%, up from 10%; Taiwan was 26%, up from 10%; and the rest of Asia was 16%, down from 24% last quarter. The distribution of orders by product group was: wafer inspection was approximately 52%, reticle inspection was 8%; metrology was 19%; service was 20%; storage, High Brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 1%. Finally, for new semiconductor system orders, the approximate distribution by customer segment was as follows. As expected, memory was strong once again at 47% in new system orders in September compared to 44% in June. Foundry came in above the original forecast at 45% in new orders, an upside from sales directed at 20-nanometer compared with 33% in June. Logic was 8% in new orders versus 23% in June, which was in line with our original forecast.","Our continued heavy investment in research and development is enabling us to maintain our strong position at the leading edge as evidenced by the fact that investments by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 76% of the orders we received in the September quarter. Total shipments in the quarter were $637 million, down 17% from the June quarter and slightly under the midpoint of the guidance range. In total, we ended the quarter with just over 1.2 billion of backlog comprised of $964 million of shipment backlog or orders that are not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months, and $251 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers.","We expect shipments in the December quarter to grow 30% at the midpoint compared with Q1 and be in the range of $800 million to $860 million, with a number of newly released products shipping in volume in the quarter.","Turning to our income statement, I'm proud of the operational execution in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin and earnings finishing at or above the upper end of our guidance ranges. Revenue for the quarter was $658 million. This level is down 9% quarter-to-quarter and down 9% versus the same quarter last year. For the December quarter, total revenue is expected in the range between $670 million and $730 million. Our revenue guidance for the December quarter reflects the impact of high shipment levels of newly introduced products during the quarter. In general, our revenue recognition policy requires the completion of formal customer acceptance on new products prior to recognizing revenue. This formal acceptance process typically takes up to 90 days to complete. As a result, revenue recognition on several tools shipping during the quarter is expected to be delayed into the March quarter.","Once the acceptance pattern is demonstrated for new products that ship to the same facilities with the same specifications, our policy generally allows for revenue recognition at the time of shipment. As a result, we expect strong sequential revenue growth in the March quarter as we begin to recognize revenue from the December newly released product shipments and as these shipments begin to convert into revenue more rapidly than in the December quarter.","Gross margin was 58.2%, up 40 basis points from the June quarter despite the lower systems revenue level. Our gross margin exceeded guidance due to the favorable product mix and lower inventory reserve charges in the quarter. We expect gross margin to remain roughly flat in the December quarter as we support higher levels of manufacturing in shipments. As revenue grows over the next several quarters, we expect gross margin to increase consistent with our 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model.","Operating expenses were $228 million, up $5 million from the June quarter. Operating expenses were $8 million higher than the midpoint of guidance for the quarter, primarily due to a pull-in of investments for some of our engineering programs and timing issues associated with cost-sharing milestones of certain projects.","R&D was $131 million, up $5 million from June as we continue to invest in key research and development activities and customer collaborations for next-generation technologies. SG&A for the quarter was $97 million, about flat quarter-on-quarter.","Going forward, we are sizing the company's quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range for the next several quarters. The timing of engineering investments and milestone achievements in our cost-sharing programs will lead to some fluctuations within this range quarter-to-quarter.","Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $10 million, down slightly from the June quarter. We expect a similar result in the December quarter. The tax rate was 21% in the quarter, lower than the 23% planning rate due primarily to nontaxable increases in our deferred compensation savings plan and the tax benefits resulting from divesting of employee equity awards in the quarter. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share would have been $0.66.","Going forward, you should continue to use the long term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Net income was $115 million, or $0.68 per fully diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investment ended the quarter at $2.95 billion, an increase of $33 million over the June quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 61 million of stock at an average price of $58.31. As of September 30, we have 4.8 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We paid a dividend of $75 million in the quarter. In July, we raised our dividend per share $0.05 to $0.45 per share. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend and reflects our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders.","Cash from operations was $177 million in the quarter, comparable to the June quarter. Net inventory increased by $26 million quarter-to-quarter to $660 million to support the expected shipment ramp. Inventory turns on GAAP COGS were 1.7 versus 1.9 in the June quarter.","Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $441 million, down $84 million from the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding based on shipments were 63 days. Net capital expenditures were $22 million to support facility expansion activities worldwide. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under $169 million and are expected to remain flat for the December quarter.","Full-time headcount ended the quarter at 5,913.","Finally, as we commented earlier, we're encouraged by the strength of the business environment at the leading edge. We believe the factors we described earlier that led to what looks to be a strong second half of calendar year 2013 will continue into 2014, giving us confidence that we'll see industry CapEx growth in 2014 of about 10%, if not a few points higher than that. Given process control adoption during no transitions in our market position, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to deliver market leading revenue growth.","With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the quarter is: bookings are expected to be within the range of $800 million and $950 million; revenue between $670 million and $730 million; and earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.87.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ted Lockwood","Okay, thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] We'll do our best to make sure everyone has a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permits. So, Mike, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Farhan, calling in for John. You're guiding to a very strong growth in the January quarter. And I just wanted to understand what's the mix that you're expecting. Is it going to be mainly foundry-driven? Relative to your shipments in this quarter, how do you expect the mix in the January quarter -- sorry, in the March quarter?","Bren Higgins","I think you mean the December quarter. We're not going to guide the March quarter. This is Bren. So when you think about the mix for December, we see memory at about 30%, and that's 50-50 NAND and DRAM. Logic at about 10% and then foundry would be 60%.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Krish Shankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rick or Bren, first question, when you look at all the memory-related bookings you're getting, are these primarily technology-related? In other words, I'm trying to figure out does this mean that they will slowly start weaning off for you guys as the quarter progresses because the technology buys would be done by then?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, as Bren mentioned in his prepared remarks, the memory -- there's 2 elements in memory. One is the work on 3D, which is a new technology that's going to be ramping over the next several quarters. And then the other is on DRAM, there are technology buys. And I think we're well-positioned in both to see increasing adoption, which we laid out that case at SEMICON West and that's starting to be what we're seeing now. So I think we're in reasonably good shape. And also, as we mentioned, there is the element of the technology buys at the front end of ramps, and we hope to continue to see that over the next couple of quarters.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just -- for the follow-up, December quarter looks like you might probably do $400 million in bookings on the foundry side. Can you help us understand how many foundries is it going to be? Is it going to be 1, 2, or 3, and is it all 20-nanometer?","Bren Higgins","Yes, this is Bren. And I'll start and then Rick can follow up. So most of the activity we expect in the December quarter is focused on 20 and below. Multiple customers, investing. There will probably be some 28 investments as well that will happen in the quarter, but that's generally how we see it.","Richard P. Wallace","Right. I think everyone is in the mode right now -- all the foundry players are in the mode of needing to make investments to support the FinFET work that they're doing below 20, but we're also seeing, as Bren mentioned, some of the guys are maybe a little bit behind or also investing to get yields up as they anticipate 20-nanometer demand. There is even some 28 spending that is still going on.","Operator","Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Given your view on WFE spend for next year and sort of given your pipeline and visibility, Rick, can you just give us an idea on the weighting of that spend, maybe first half versus second half and some color on how the different market segments, logic, foundry, memory will kind of shake out from a mix perspective next year?","Richard P. Wallace","Why don't I let Bren start and then I'll follow-up?","Bren Higgins","So I think -- I don't think know if we can comment at this point around whether it's first half or second half. I mean right now, it feels pretty evenly distributed. But we'll see how that goes as we get closer to it. When you think about the composition, I think memory is probably somewhere between 30% and 40%. And so I think you'll see logic foundry there at 70 with, let's say, the logic pieces around 20 and foundry at the difference. So as I said, pretty evenly distributed. I think we're, right now, we're sizing the company given our comments in the prepared remarks around WFE, up 10%, maybe a few points better. So that, I think, puts us in a position where we're sort of sizing the company around $800 million to $850 million a quarter in terms of new business levels.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And given that most of the activity today is around both migration and given the significant step up in complexity for this next-generation processes, I know that you guys have talked about increased process control intensity at the front or the ramp of a new node. But are you guys also seeing a bias towards usage of predominantly leading-edge tools, like for example, a bias towards your 29xx platform versus your 28xx platform? Any way to quantify, let's say, for 3D NAND or 16-nanometer FinFET, what percentage of tools are skewed towards your leading-edge tools, is it 70, 30, and so on?","Richard P. Wallace","No. It's more -- it's higher than that if you're talking sub-20-nanometer. And really, the mix is not so much 29xx versus prior generation. The broadband plasma, I think, is almost all going to be the 29xx if you look below the 20-nanometer. It's really a blend of that versus the laser scanning tools that we have. And again, as we laid out at SEMICON West, you'll see a mixture of that probably at the front end of a ramp more heavily loaded toward the broadband plasma and then later in the ramp, the laser tools will come into play. But you're right, process intensity going up. We think in 2014, probably somewhere 15% to 16%, and that really depends, as Bren indicated before, what -- how memory ends up being as a total percent of the mix. While memory is up, it's, as we know, it's less intensive for process control than foundry and logic is.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First thing, Bren, just a reference to your answer that you just gave. So you're sort of implying that March quarter revenue, given all the deferred, is sort of an $825-ish million range, is that right?","Bren Higgins","Well, I'm not guiding it, but I think that given these new tools actually get acceptance and we move into the March quarter, there is going to be a delay there. So I'm expecting strong sequential growth, somewhere in probably the 10% to 12% off of the midpoint. So I'm not guiding March. $825 million probably feels a little high, but we'll see how we do when we get there and we'll see what happens in terms of our performance relative to the guidance ranges that we gave. The higher end, I think it makes it more possible, but we'll have to see how it plays out.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then can you just give us the September breakdown in memory bookings by NAND and DRAM? And then I wanted to ask Rick, if I look at R&D expense and I just compare it relative to the last time you were sort of an $800 million range. I'm just looking at the March. It's like a good $15 million, $20 million, arguably even $25 million higher. So can you just sort of address what that increment is? Is it related to $450 million versus last time or is it related to an increased competitive environment?","Richard P. Wallace","So first on the NAND versus the DRAM in the September quarter, it was 60% NAND, 40% DRAM. As far as the increased R&D, there's a couple of factors. One, just the advanced technologies are requiring more investment and just the materials alone, if you think about bringing those in, are up. But there are 2 programs that are -- so I would argue absent EUV work that we're doing in the reticle space and some of the 450 we're doing, we'd actually be at a lower level. But -- so the efficiency keeps going. But that's not really fair because we have to do 450, and there's some element of investment that's going on with that. And then the EUV, while it's not at full rate, it is certainly taking investment that is now -- probably nothing comparable to that back then because we were at the end of the 6xx peak investment at that point. So I think those are the probably the 2 biggest single elements to that.","Bren Higgins","I guess the only other thing I'd add to that is that we are investing in some other markets that we weren't back then. So that's probably a factor in this as well, right? So more TAM [ph] opportunity but some investment requirements to participate.","Operator","Your next question is from Srini Sundararajan.","Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC","The additional spend from Intel on solving the defect density, do you have an idea on what that could be and whether you will see that from other vendors such as other foundries such as TSMC and others?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, as you know, we're not going to comment on specific customers. But in general, it is absolutely true that once you go sub-20 or really, it's about FinFET, that I think that process control and complexities really increase in 2 areas. And I'd say one is, no question, there's more metrology opportunity there, especially as EUV is being delayed. I think there's more opportunity for opportunity in process control around just the patterning space. And then the other one is defectivity, and we are seeing advanced opportunities for us as people go sub-20. And as I mentioned earlier, the need to go to our latest generation broadband plasma tools and the latest generation laser scanning tools. So I think all those factors are contributing.","Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC","Okay, just a quick follow-up. Rick, do you have any comments on the Tokyo Electron, Applied Materials merger potentially?","Richard P. Wallace","No, not really. I mean I think that it kind of makes sense, I suppose, from their perspective. From ours, it's -- the one perhaps advantage is we've remained very focused on an opportunistic time period where we've got a great market. And I think one of our competitors is going to be a bit distracted. But we're not kidding ourselves. All competition is going to be intense and we got to continue to execute.","Operator","Your next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Rick, I have a question on the memory booking. And If I look at a number and also triangulating with kind of increased memory intensity that you guys talked about on this -- during SEMICON, it seems like memory booking is picking up a lot faster. Do you see that the memory intensity is actually expanding faster than what you guys have talked? Well, I think you guys talked about only 140 basis point on the next 2 node. Do you expect that to kind of accelerate as you see these new memory orders?","Richard P. Wallace","We don't know. It's early. But I would say 2 factors. One, there was a long period in which people weren't investing. And I think that there's a bit of catch-up going on relative to that. And then the other factor is I think some of the guys that are ramping new technologies have recognized the value of accelerating their investments. So getting inspection metrology capability in place at the front end. And some of those guys have logic experience now and they recognize the value of that. So I think there's some catch-up. I think there's front end loading, small degree. And I think that I'd still stick with the model that we showed at West.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I see. Okay, that's helpful. And my follow-up just quickly on account FinFET versus 20-nanometer planar gate, right? You said a step-up in process control intensity. Based on the comments from the last question, it sounds like you believe there is. And in that way, if that is, is there a way that you can kind of quantify that?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. We definitely model that as we laid it out at West. But I think the process control intensity goes up both in the metrology space but also the defectivity. We did quantify that. I don't have a...","Bren Higgins","About 30%, if you went from, let's say, 28 to 20 and below. A little hard to parse out what's 16 versus 20. I mean, they're doing the lithography at 20, FinFET at 16 and below. But generally, about a 30% increase in terms of dollars per wafer start. It's the same tool set, generally, for the 20 and below. So we capture it that way.","Operator","Your next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, a question on consolidation in the process control. We still have several players in the process control. In visual processing side, you're seeing a pretty good consolidation. What are your thoughts on consolidation, especially in the metrology segment?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, I don't see a lot of impetus to change for us. I think we're well-positioned with the products that we have. It may be true that some of the smaller players that we compete with will find that there's some benefit in merging or doing some M&A. But I kind of don't think that makes a lot of sense because a lot of what they've done to be able to have a business at all is focused on a segment. And I actually think that they would run the risk of losing some focus if they were to try to put together companies that didn't naturally go together. I don't think anybody else has the same kind of opportunity to put together a KLA-Tencor kind of company based on just geographies and technologies. And I think we're uniquely positioned to do that. So it may happen, but I don't see it likely that it happens.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then one more question on market share. I think, earlier in the year when the markets were a little bit weaker and your orders were weaker, there were a lot of discussions on market share losses in several segments. Now that you are coming to closer to the end of the year, do you have a good estimate for where you will end up in market share on some of the segment, particularly on the wafer inspection, considering that there are claims being made that you're losing market share?","Richard P. Wallace","Right. We don't see it. We haven't seen that we are losing. We've seen, in fact, that we have some strengthening going on in the broadband plasma adoption, which is very high-value capability for our customers, strong performance for us. I think that it's always hard when we have competitors who have a small part of their business in our space. It's hard to refute their claims that they're gaining share. But I think if you look at our overall relative performance, we seem to be doing well, and I think that's a function of both process control adoption but also our share. We think there's actually opportunity, I mentioned this at SEMICON West, to see some gains in market share through this year and then into 2014. And we feel very good about the position we're [Audio Gap] that we had in the quarter are associated with new technologies, new capabilities. So we think that that's strengthening our position as we go forward. So we feel very good about the market share.","Operator","Your next question is from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, I just wanted to understand your outlook in 2014, kind of 2014. If you're talking about increasing process control intensity and greater process control share in the memory space, is it fair to say that you guys should see better-than-expected revenue growth, better then industry revenue growth in 2014? And also, can you talk about how you see the use of e-Beam tools, sub-20-nanometer node in logic?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. I'll let Bren take part one and I'll take the second part.","Bren Higgins","Yes. I think you know we covered this a little bit in our prepared remarks. But I think given the compelling nature of these node transitions and how customers are now actively moving that direction that we think we are positioned to see the kind of dynamics that we saw, let's say, in 2011 and 2012 around relative growth for process control in KLA. So I think, in contrast to most or the earlier part of this year where maturing yields in 28-nanometer, the last sort of 1\/3 of capacity being added that most of the spend was really focused on capacity buys. So as we move forward here with what we believe is a strong technology environment, given the strength that we're seeing with our new products and multiple new products across all our major core segments, we feel pretty good about an opportunity to outperform the industry.","Richard P. Wallace","In terms of e-Beam below 20-nanometer, I probably meant it this way. I think the e-Beam per review of optically detected defects continues to be a good segment to be in. And we have a very strong position in that segment. We gained share recently and have a great product offering there. In terms of inspection, it remains a niche application. I do think there are opportunities for it but it's a relatively small niche. And I think it would grow on the order of similar kind of growth rate to what we see in optical inspection, overall, probably not as fast. But I think there is some opportunity but it's pretty niche. So I don't see that there is a particular gap that, that technology is filling. I think it's more of a specific niche. Review is where we see the most opportunity and we've got a strong position there.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up, again, on the logic order question at 14-nanometer. Do you get the sense that higher logic spend at 14-nanometer to address this defect density issues is all accounted in your 2014 view, again with the process intensity growing to 15% to 16%? Or do you get the sense of growth beyond that as we get into 2015, which is when the foundry has really hit the FinFET spend.","Richard P. Wallace","In 20 -- or just in terms of logic spend, we had a very strong first half of the year in logic. Now we tend to get more lead time in logic. So it's not -- it's consistent with our forecast that we haven't seen a lot -- we didn't see a lot of orders in the September quarter and don't expect that much in December. I think as we progress into next year though, I think as the 14-nanometer ramp starts to play out and planned out, I think that we'll see it pick up then. I mean, it's always interesting whenever we hear these little data points or these or announcements around, well, CapEx is up or CapEx is down or we're having these issues. We work pretty closely with our customers, and so within -- around the logic space, we're pretty tight in terms of their plans around yield management and process control. So we don't necessarily see these blips in business associated with an error there.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I can follow up then on the gross margin progression that you're going to likely see on all these new tools. I mean how should we think about modeling cost of goods sold from these products shipped but not recognized for sales? Is there perhaps a step function increase in gross margin in the March quarter when the revenue show up?","Richard P. Wallace","No. I don't think it's going to be all that different than what we have seen historically. And that's why I made the comment about, from an incremental gross margin perspective, the 60% to 70% model is how you ought to be thinking about it. Certainly, in any given quarter, we'll have mix issues that will drive us over or under that range or the higher end or lower end of that range. I mean, one of the things that's encouraging is we are starting to see a bit of a pickup in the mash-up segment of reticle inspection here going forward. And that's a more favorable mix product for us that has been pretty weak over the last several quarters. So I think as that comes in, I think we feel pretty good about the mix overall and the margin performance. And assuming we can manage our product transitions well and minimize our inventory exposures, I think we should be fine.","Operator","Next question is from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Rick. If I look at your foundry orders based on the guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like your foundry orders for calendar '13 could be down somewhere in the vicinity of, say, 15% year-over-year. We've all known that the foundries are supposed to be the highest in terms of the process control intensity. I'm just trying to reconcile where are we wrong here and how was the trend going to shake out in 2014, given all the industry inflections in the foundry next year? And I have a follow-up.","Bren Higgins","So this is Bren, I'll start, and then Rick can come in if there's anything to add here. So yes, foundry in calendar '13 was a little bit weaker for us so I think your numbers are about right. We're seeing the orders here starting to pick up now here in the second half. And I think it bodes well for what we expect in '14 where we think foundry should be solidly up next year to drive the 10% kind of growth that we expect. I think when we think about next year right now, memory is probably flattish for us, right? Maybe a little bit up, but with foundry picking up and logic may be up as well. So...","Richard P. Wallace","And it's probably true that if you looked at bookings, obviously, that would be true. If you look at revenue, probably a slightly different story because a lot of what we saw in '13 was revenue that came for foundries from orders that were in '12. And so we -- there is kind of this node component of it so that at the beginning of 28, we would see some strength and then you kind of hit an air pocket until you get to 20, which is what we're starting to see some of now we think that picks up. So it's a little bit hard to dissect it on an annualized basis. You really have to look node to node. And that's how we expect, and we are already seeing signs that, that will strengthen as we go into '14.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then as a follow-up, [indiscernible] backdrop that we all know that spending is going to be up at least 10% year-over-year. [indiscernible] subsegment between inspection metrology and reticle inspection going into next year, given the spending mix that you see, particularly with 3D NAND being extremely process control intensive. so I'm just trying to get a sense from that.","Bren Higgins","Can you repeat the first part of the question? We didn't hear it.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. The first part of the question was that with spending going to be up 10% year-over-year, how should we think about movements that trends between your various segments, i.e. between your wafer inspection metrology as well as reticle inspection between 413 and 414, and given the spending that you're going to see particularly from 3D NAND, which is process control intensive. I'm just trying to get a sense of how directionally the wafer inspection metrology and reticle moves.","Richard P. Wallace","Well, so reticle inspection tends to be a little bit lumpy. So we can probably expect to see that somewhere between sort of the 10%, maybe as high as 15%. But generally, most of -- that is a business that has been a little bit weak. It's starting to pick up again. But -- and I think we'll see investments happen in a given quarter and then it will fall off on follow-on quarters. So I think you can think about it in terms of 10% to 15% range. I think metrology generally is about 15% to 20%. And I think wafer inspection is around 1\/2 the business, and that includes high-end pattern inspection on pattern e-Beam and so on.","Operator","Your next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Rick, what is going to be driving the variance in your December quarter booking? Is that by the type of a device manufacturer, foundry versus memory? Or is it more driven by product mix?","Richard P. Wallace","You mean how do we have the range?","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes.","Richard P. Wallace","Both sides of the range or...","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. What's going to drive having -- you having the low end versus the high end.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. It's less about particular device types and more about customer activity. And as you know, we often have some products that are pretty big in terms of the big impact because the dollar value is high and with those come in or if they don't, that'll swing it. So I think it's less about any particular segment and more just the general variation we see in the bookings environment, given fewer customers that place bigger orders and just if they come in or not. Nothing in particular in terms of device type or projects that we're counting on.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. And then going back to prior commentary on R&D. You emphasized some 450-millimeter-related projects. But how about the EUV en masse inspection? Could you elaborate on your plans? Or how should we think about incremental spending that is needed to get the R&D up and running?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we have investment going now. We'll continue to make that investment. We believe that eventually, there's going to be a need for an [indiscernible] inspector so at EUV wavelengths. We have the capability now in our 6xx platform to satisfy market needs, probably through the 10-nanometer node for EUV. Although it's not ultimately what people want for volume production. It will have -- we'll start seeing delays in our forecasted timed market if we don't ramp inspection investment through 2014. And right now, we're working with customers to determine exactly what the demand is. It's a bit of a waiting game because our customers are feeling, I think, more and more concerned about the insertion point of EUV production. And I'd say in the last few months that the sentiment has been pushing out EUV in terms of its high-volume manufacturing, which means that pushing out and giving sort of more time for the investment. So on the one hand, that'll dampen our investment in our reticle tool, but on the other hand, it creates great opportunity and patterning process control and we're going to benefit from that. So I would say, it's still stay tuned because we haven't secured customer commitment toward the need and the sharing of some of the investment risk of that. And I think that's going to take some time.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just to make sure that I understand, that incremental investment that you would need to make, that has to do with sub-10 nanometer or you're still not sure on 10-nanometer?","Richard P. Wallace","No, we think that the tool set that we have, the 6xx, can support -- we think that 10-nanometer will be pretty light for EUV production. And so EUV is likely pushing out of 10-nanometer, in which case, customers will be able to, by and large, do what they need to do with the capabilities that we have. But that's not high-volume EUV manufacturing. So we'll need to invest significantly more if we want to have a tool that intercepts high-volume manufacturing EUV, but that continues to be delayed.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, can you just remind us what the incremental increase in capital intensity is in the transition from planar to 3D NAND in terms of process control? And maybe you could go, well, one step below on the inspection side as well?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. I don't have it committed to memory. I think, in general, that what we see is that there's a significant CAGR on the increase if you go to 40 nanometers down to some of the 3D stuff. But remember, the adoption rate was low, I think, in the mid-8s. And we're talking about a 30% increase in that adoption as you go to the 3D. And we're seeing some evidence. But again, nobody has really done volume 3D, so nobody really knows for certain. But the initial activity we see from our customers support the thesis that we're going to see increasing demand for process control.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","For the foundry node, can you refresh, again, on what the differences are in the capital intensity between 28, 20 and FinFET? And for 2014, for foundries, do you think your opportunity is bigger for 20-nanometer or for the FinFET development? And the last question is, what should we look for, for the tax rate for 2014?","Bren Higgins","All right. I'll start here on the easiest one. I think the tax rate does fluctuate a little bit, but I think for modeling purposes, you should just go ahead and assume 23%, now bridge it to the actual against that number as we go through. But I think that overall, as we model it out, that's a reasonable percentage.","Richard P. Wallace","So on the question of process control intensity, what we laid out at West was that in the logic foundry space that the 2x nanometer, 4x, it was about, we average 15.8% intensity. At 2x, it was 17%. And we saw that at 1x going to 18.4%. So that's really the difference between the 2x would be the planar work and what we see going into the 3D. And so 18.4%. For memory for 3D, we saw that increasing as you go from 8.8% as we said up by about 30%.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Do you think in 2014 for the foundries, are you going to sell more of your equipment for 20-nanometer capacity or for FinFET development for foundries?","Bren Higgins","Well, I mean I think a lot of it, to Rick's point, the intensity goes up on a per wafer start basis. So it really gets back to how much capacity ultimately gets added in terms of how many tools are actually purchased, how much we actually end up shipping. So -- but node to node, as Rick mentioned, we see a 30% increase in dollars per wafer starts spent on process control.","Operator","There are no further questions.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours.","Theodore Lockwood","Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Wallace","Thanks, Ed. KLA delivered strong results for the March quarter, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance for revenue and above the range for Non-GAAP EPS. We achieved these results despite the near-term softening in the wafer fab equipment market, showing the resiliency of KLA's business model and the compelling value of our strategy is focused on market and technology leadership, revenue diversification and operational excellence.","We also closed the Orbotech acquisition in Q1, and work has begun to execute integration efforts and realized revenue and cost synergies. The value creation opportunity in the combination with Orbotech are compelling. We are further diversifying our revenue streams and expanding our reach in the global electronics value chain, enhancing our ability to serve new and existing customers in fast growing end markets, such as 5G infrastructure, smart mobile and automotive to name a few.","Now I'd like to point out key reasons why the combination with Orbotech is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Orbotech shares core values with KLA, as well as a proven track record of enabling customer success, having long distinguished themselves for market leadership, innovation, technology and talent. Orbotech's market leader in each of the segments it serves, and there is no customer overlap in the PCB and flat panel markets. And there is no product overlap in the specialty semiconductor and advanced packaging business.","Now, we are serving a larger and more diversified market with a broader portfolio of products and solutions. Orbotech business diversified, serving different segments each with their own cycle dynamics. Orbotech's revenue in calendar 2018 grew 16% to $1.04 billion, with a three-year CAGR of 12%. Of note, the specialty semiconductor business grew 23% in 2018 and is poised for high growth again in 2019, against a backdrop drop of broad-based weakness electronics manufacturing.","Turning now to today's semiconductor market environment. Based on consensus industry reporting, WFE grew in the mid-teens in 2018, which is significantly higher than was previously projected. Process control intensity remain flat in 2018 in a year of strong memory investment. We are seeing higher adoption of inspection and metrology solutions for memory customers to support the 3D NAND roadmap and scaling to tighten design rules and DRAM.","EUV was also a key factor in 2018 equipment spending, including process control infrastructure and reticle and optical wafer inspection. Given the expectation that EUV investment will continue in 2019 and together with a large percentage of foundry and large spending in the WFE Mac mix. We expect process control intensity to increase in the calendar year.","The Gartner report for 2018, shows KLA held strong market share and process control. Thanks to our differentiated product portfolio, technology leadership and strong customer collaboration. Consistent with our peers, we expect WFE will be down approximately 15% to 20%, in 2019, largely due to weaker DRAM demand, NAND investment is also expected to be down in the year.","While foundry and logic investment will increase, driven by the 7-nanometer ramp, EUV development and the steady trailing edge demand to support 5G infrastructure, IoT and automotive applications. 2019 will be a dynamic and exciting year for KLA, despite the current market turbulence, we are well positioned to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and our business execution competencies to show good relative performance in the year and emerge even stronger when the market rebounds.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren, for his review of the financial results. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a busy quarter for KLA. We launched our new corporate brand in January, closed the Orbotech acquisition in late February, executed a $1.2 billion debt financing in March and delivered results that met or exceeded the updated guidance for the June quarter we issued on March 5 after the close of the acquisition.","Total revenue in the quarter was $1.097 billion at the upper end of the revised guidance range of between $1.025 billion to $1.115 billion. GAAP earnings per share was $1.23 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.80, finishing above the range of guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.78 at the 14% long-term tax planning.","We are pleased with the results we achieved in Q1 and are off to a solid start for calendar 2019 consistent with our expectations. We are now moving forward in our plans for integration of Orbotech and focusing on strong execution and operations excellence across our business.","Due to the close of the Orbotech acquisition, there are meaningful differences between the GAAP results and the non-GAAP results. I encourage you to review the reconciliation between the two contained in our press release. The remainder of my comments here today are based on the non-GAAP results.","As this is the first quarter we are reporting combined results for KLA and Orbotech, we will provide income statement, cash flow and balance sheet for KLA inclusive of Orbotech in addition to customary disclosures in demand commentary. Bridge results to the original guidance we provided back in January for semi process control business, we will share details on the financial results for this business and Orbotech separately.","We are disclosing this additional information is a means for investors to better understand the dynamics of the KLA and Orbotech businesses in the stub period. Looking ahead, as we move forward in integrating the businesses, we plan to transition our disclosures and financial reporting to reflect the results and operations for KLA on a consolidated basis.","Now, for the March quarter results. As I mentioned, total revenues in the first quarter were $1.097 billion, product sales accounted for 72% of total revenues. We expect total revenue to grow about 14% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion in the June quarter, with sequential quarterly revenue growth expected to continue through the calendar year.","For both the semi process control business and the Orbotech business, we expect the second half revenue levels to be higher than the first half. In terms of regional split of revenue for the combined company, Taiwan was 25% of revenue, China was 19%, Korea was 18%, Japan was 13%, the U.S. was 14%, Europe was 7% and the Rest of Asia was 4%.","Now I'll turn to some detail on commentary regarding demand trends in the March quarter for the semi process control business. Semi process control revenue, which includes the traditional KLA systems and service businesses was $936 million in the quarter.","The expected overall demand environment for 2019, in the semi process control market is consistent with our original view from January with KLA looking to benefit from strong foundry and logic demand growth, reasonably balanced across the year.","And with the expectation for the current soft demand environment in memory to persist throughout the year. Weak memory industry demand continues to influence our customer's caution towards their equipment investment plans. While we have some visibility into plans in this segment, they remain fluid given the current industry outlook and customer commitments could change quickly and without warning.","We remain optimistic about long-term memory equipment demand, due to raising capital intensity to deliver bit growth supply and disciplined financial management by our customers. However, due to the consolidated nature of our industry, any shift in customer delivery requirements could impact our near-term results. Semi process control shipments were $957 million in Q1, above the range of guidance of $860 million to $940 million.","As expected with the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The difference between shipment results and revenue for KLA is immaterial and largely a function of short-term timing dynamics. As a result, we will continue to guide and report shipments through the June quarter, but we'll move to revenue only disclosure for business units, geographic distribution and customer mix, beginning with the reporting of the September quarter.","In short, under ASC 606, the difference between shipments and revenue was not sufficiently material to warrant the cost and effort require to maintain dual reporting. We expect total shipments of $1.235 billion to $1.315 billion in Q2 with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion. Memory was 38% of semi process control system shipments in March and we expect memory to be approximately 47% of this mix in the June quarter.","Foundry was 54% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 41% of the total in June. Shipments to logic customers were 8% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 12% in Q2. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group for the semi process control business was wafer inspection was 42%, patterning was 30%, including shipments for reticle inspection, service was 24% and non-semi component inspection was approximately 4%.","Now for some additional details of results from the Orbotech businesses in the quarter. A reminder that these results are for the 39 days stub period following the February 20th close of the acquisition. Revenue was $161 million above the guided range of $145 million to $155 million for the stub period. The semiconductor device business delivered strong revenues for the first quarter and momentum is expected to continue throughout calendar 2019, driven by strength in PVD and edge applications for RF, power and advanced packaging.","This business is the market technology leader in targeted specialty semiconductor segments and is delivering faster revenue growth rates in the overall semiconductor equipment market and demand drivers include automotive, 5G investment and MEMS\/sensor applications for IoT as well as growth in China.","The printed circuit board business grew 10% in 2018 and is positioned to deliver solid relative performance in 2019 compared with the broader electronics market. Orbotech is the market and technology leader in critical applications in the PCB manufacturing process, such as laser direct imaging, optical inspection for defect control and repair. The PCB division will introduce several new products in 2019 to meet the requirements of new technologies such as mSAP and flex PCB and capture the future growth resulting from increasing PCB complexity.","Additionally, the service component is an important aspect of the overall value proposition for this business and is approximately 40% of its total revenue. Similar to the semi-process control service model PCB service has a high percentage of recurring contract revenue and is focused on value-added services such as application support and software upgrades and not just basic break-and-fix services.","The flat panel display business reflects the current weak overall industry demand conditions in LCD and OLED manufacturing. This market is experiencing a digestion period is leading display customers realigned their product strategies and production capacity to shift to new technologies.","Advanced Panel design, such as high-end jumbo OLED TVs and flexible portable displays are becoming more expensive and complex to manufacture, featuring smaller pixel sizes increased pixel density in multiple layers. As the market leader in test repair and inspection solutions for FPD, our business benefits from new capacity growth, as well as from an increasing technical complexity in the next-gen display market. Though the market environment is challenging in 2019, we believe we are well positioned when the market recovers.","Turning now to financial results for the combined company. Gross margin was 60% in March, slightly better than the implied gross margin associated with the updated guidance, as product mix in the semi process control business was mostly consistent with what we modeled in January. In June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 58% to 59%. Gross margin in the semi process control business is expected to be slightly lower quarter-to-quarter as modest volume benefit of higher revenue is offset by the expected product mix.","For KLA consolidated gross margin, in addition to expectations for our semi-process control business, the change quarter quarter-to-quarter is also the result of approximately $90 million of additional Orbotech revenue representing a full quarter of revenue for this business.","Based on our current outlook for business unit performance and overall revenue levels for the remainder of calendar 2019, we expect stronger quarterly gross margins in the second half and you should model gross margins for the combined company in the range of 59.5% to 60.5%.","As in past M&A, we see a number of opportunities to improve Orbotech gross margins over time as we leverage our global manufacturing scale shared and common supply chain, service infrastructure, and internal supply capabilities. Total operating expenses were $311 million in March and operating margin was 31.6%.","For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $375 million at the midpoint as we will incur a full quarter of Orbotech operating expenses and a modest increase in R&D expense in our semi-process control business.","Given our topline expectations and planned product development investment profile, we expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019. I would note that OpEx includes stock-based compensation expenses Orbotech, which is previously excluded from there non-GAAP public reporting as an independent company.","Operating expense synergy planning related to the acquisition is underway and we will provide periodic updates on our progress in this area over the coming quarters. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $22 million, including the impact of the debt service to fund a portion of the transaction for the stub period.","Going forward you should model quarterly OIE at approximately $35 million principally due to the incremental debt in the capital structure to fund the acquisition and other corporate activities including our ongoing share repurchase authorization. The effective tax rate was 13% in the quarter, given the new corporate tax structure in the US and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, including the contribution from Orbotech, investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at 14% going forward.","Net income was $283 million and we had $157 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. During the quarter, we issued approximately 12 million shares as a component of the transaction consideration for the acquisition. We are expecting weighted average share count for Q2 to be approximately 162 million shares.","Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.9 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. As stated earlier, on March 13th, we issued $1.2 billion of 10 and 30-year senior notes with a blended coupon of 4.4%.","Our gross leverage ratio at the end of the March quarter was 1.7 times within our target range of 1.5x to 2x gross leverage. Cash from operations was $164 million and free cash flow was $138 million. We paid an aggregate of $114 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalent upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $200 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.","We have approximately $1.2 billion available under our current share repurchase authorization. We expect to execute this repurchase program systematically over the next 12, 18 months, subject to market conditions.","In conclusion, the March quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance and relative strength for KLA and a weaker overall WFE environment. We completed the acquisition of Orbotech integration and synergy activities are underway. With a diversified end markets, market leadership across a broad product portfolio and operations discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019. And what is expected to be a challenging year in the electronics manufacturing markets.","With that to summarize, guidance for the June quarter is revenue between $1.21 billion and $1.29 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.90 to $1.39 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.55 per share to $1.85 per share. Total shipments are expected between $1.235 and $1.315 billion with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion in the June quarter.","Before turning the call over for your questions, we're pleased to inform investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We will have more details to follow in the coming weeks and we look forward to seeing you all in September.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Theodore Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions and we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, given the limited time for today's call. All right Jerome, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy, your line is now open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. I had a couple. So Bren, just on the gross margin guidance 58% to 59% non-GAAP, it's a little lower than, if you just sort of do the math for the two companies. It seems like it'd be in the 60% to 61% range. So, first of all, can you sort of talk, is there like a one-timer happening in? And then sort of snap up into the '60s maybe for the back for the back half of the year? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. So, yes, I mean this quarter, there is some just mix dynamics that are driving the margin a little bit lower than you would think. And as I said in the prepared comments that we would expect gross margins in the second half to be higher. At the end of the day on our core business, it's going to move around on product mix across the different products or is bringing revenue in it at about $255 million in the quarter.","We expected to grow in the second half as we said in the comments. And their gross margin is trending in the high 40th percentile. So, when you blend it out that we end up, but I would expect the second half margins to be higher, which is why I gave the full calendar year commentary as well that modeling somewhere between 59.5% and 60.5% for the year.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, awesome, Bren. And then maybe, and I know probably you'll go through some of this at the Analyst Day, but can you give us maybe some milepost as the business grows into next year and the year after, sort of what the financial model looks like, and maybe just pick like $6 billion as like an annual run rate once you get to 1.5 billion quarter, what is the model looks like? What's gross margin and what is our margin look like? Thank you.","Bren Higgins","Yes. So Tim, I want to get away from or I want to get into to necessarily guiding out further. And so this is just need just thinking about where the numbers might line up, obviously the comments I made around product mix. Our issues that obviously would affect our performance. But, yes, I think gross margins probably settle in at those kind of revenue levels in the between 60% and 61%.","Certainly, operating expenses are going to move, according to product development requirements. And then, of course, there are some synergy opportunities that we're going to be executing. So the time-frame that we were to get to those kinds of numbers that you referred to would be a factor and all of that.","So, the way we presented in the longer term model was a couple of points of dilution related to the Orbotech transaction to our longer term model that we published, which - so I think that, when you're thinking in the mid-30 kind of percent operating margin range on those revenue levels. So, hopefully that helps.","Timothy Arcuri","Okay, Bren, thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek, your line is now open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the overall demand environment. I think when the year started the industry view was that WFE would be down 10% to 15% - it's down 15% to 20%, not just from you guys, but obviously from all of your peers. What's the slope of recovery here? When do you think the start to get visibility as to when we will see a recovery in overall spending?","Richard Wallace","Yes, this is - I'll take part of it, and then this is Rick and Bren can add in. It is true that the rate of decline, the magnitude is higher, but that's largely because December finished stronger - 28 finish stronger than - 2018 than we had originally modeled. And so if you look at what the overall numbers we're talking about for 2019.","We're still in a similar kind of range $45 billion to $46 billion with WLP. So that was really the way we're looking at that. And we'd also said in the past that this is really starting to strengthen even into the June quarter, but the second half as Bren indicated in his comments are going to be stronger for KLA, but also for the industry.","Bren Higgins","Yes, the only - to Rick's points, the year-over-year ratios are moving around given the strength of the finished 2018 now that everybody has reported. And so it looks like 2018 is a little bit stronger. So our view is very consistent with what we thought in January. We saw mid-40s WFE levels for the year with the March quarter being the bottom and sequential growth for the Company resuming in June and continue in the second half. So second half stronger than first half.","Foundry logic reasonably balanced across the year was our perspective. So, what's interesting is we are three months later and his played out as we thought. So, I don't think there's anything really different than what we thought a couple of months ago. And certainly, we are watching the end market dynamics and what those ultimately will mean to just given the consolidated nature of our business to our customers' investment plans. But so far, playing out as we expected a few months ago.","Vivek Arya","Thanks. And for my follow-up, China, so the demand from China, do you think that is kind of trending down in line with the overall WFE? Or are you seeing any more disruption because of trade tension or is this just an absorption period of because what they installed last year. So what I'm getting with that is that as we hopefully get some easing of tensions, do you think demand from China will improve at some point?","Bren Higgins","Yes, we've had puts and takes around China. We disclosed shipment profile in January that we thought to be down between 10% and 15% in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018. And our view is pretty consistent with that. We've seen some strengthening from certain customers and we came from others.","So our general view is pretty consistent overall, so it looks like we'll see more foundry logic investment this year. And certainly, you have the OEMs that are investing both in terms of - or the need for wafer capacity materials, wafer capacity and reticle capacity.","So I would say for 2019, our views are pretty consistent thousands what we thought a few months ago. I would say that on the trade tensions, I'd say that was a factor early in the calendar year at the end of last year of uncertainty.","And now I think the way China is behaving as more just based on the way the overall industry is behaving relative to demand, and so we're seeing those plans are gated on that, not as much on concerns around trade.","Vivek Arya","Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan, your line is now open.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On Orbotech, there's been some headwinds on the display, CapEx trends this year as you guys mentioned, but the move to OLED by some of their customers should boost capital intensity for their products.","In PCB disappointing handset unit trends, but again offset by the move to things like mSAP technology and more automotive goodness there, SDD continued strong, so a number of puts and takes, but this is on the June quarter guidance and sort of backing into the full quarter March revenues for Orbotech in your comments about second half. It does appear that Orbotech will drive higher revenues versus calendar year 2018. Is that a fair assumption?","Richard Wallace","So Harlan, when we look at the business today, and again, we only had it for the 40 days of the first quarter. So we do expect sequential growth through the year. I would say, or Orbotech that will be in the ballpark of what they did in calendar 2018 based on what we see today, perhaps slightly less.","I think given our relative to prepare - given the environment overall for electronics in terms of just softening and digestion that's happening out there. Looks like the business has been pretty resilient for the reasons that you described. And certainly what we're seeing on the semiconductor side is that's an area of WFE where there is growth in investment. And so, we would expect to see that business grow more in a more meaningful way in 2019 versus 2018.","Bren Higgins","And then longer-term, Harlan, we're - we believe we're on track with the architect plan that was laid out in 2017, when you talk about the longer-term trends all seem to be very positive and we're excited about what we've seen. We think the Company is well positioned with the assets as part of KLA and we'll continue to build on the momentum, as you say FPD has had some headwinds, but there's been some good wins in the other parts of the business.","Harlan Sur","Yes, absolutely. Good insights sir. Thank you. And then looking at the Gartner shared data for 2018 in your flagship optical inspection franchise. Think you guys gained about 500 basis points of market share, and I think now you guys are almost like 14x larger than your nearest competitor, and this is versus a 7x last year. So, huge drop of your competitors. Is the bar just getting raised really that much higher with like your Gen 5 tools and your updated Gen 4 platform. And then how is the momentum shaping up this year for your Gen 5 platform?","Richard Wallace","So I'll take part and then let Bren get into the specifics. I think you're right. I think that what we're seeing is to continued investment by our customers and the flagship products both Gen 4 and Gen 4. And so one of the things I think a couple of generations we realized is we're going to keep investing in prior generation. So for example, the Gen 4 is how to build out two, in addition to what we're seeing at Gen 5.","And I think for our customers it's the most effective way to manage their yield challenges and wrap their facilities. So we feel really good about where we are. We continue to invest strongly and as Bren will tell you, we're seeing the progress that we were hoping for in Gen 5.","Bren Higgins","Yes, this year's a good year for Gen 5 Harlan we expected to see multiple units adoption from all major customers, so encouraged by that. We'll probably end the year with somewhere around 30 units in the field. If I were to fast forward, obviously we need to execute over the next several months. But that's our expectation. So it's nice growth and adoption of that product line. And we introduced the next iteration on Gen 4 product is customers tried to extend that capability too.","So you're seeing a mix and match adoption profile from our customers there. We also have a new product in the laser scanning space called Voyager. And that's the adoption has been really positive on that too. So you're seeing to mix and match across the Puma platform, plus Voyager. So for the total portfolio of optical pattern inspection, it's very well positioned in the market and we would expect as you see foundry move on to 5 nanometer down the road, including what they're doing today to support 7 nanometers activities, the logic investments that are happening. We feel pretty good about the position into that product line.","Harlan Sur","Yes. Nice job on the execution. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. John, your line is now open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. As always appreciate sort of the industry backdrop color you gave in your preamble. I'd be coming curious, especially with the inclusion of Orbotech, you gave us a lot of color around what happens to the total addressable market in calendar year 2019. I'll be curious as to how you see your SAM evolving in calendar year 2019 with all the puts and take?","Bren Higgins","Sure. I think that as we laid out early, Orbotech we think gives us access to another $2.5 billion in overall addressable market based on their position. We think that as we go forward to combine that with what we have in the rest of our business, we're at about $8 billion this year, and that should continue to grow.","Basically, as we think about the products that are in the pipeline and things that we're working on, we think the TAM over the next few years grows, maybe another 10% beyond that $8 billion as we go forward based on new product entries and market growth. So we don't need a tremendous amount of market growth based on some of the new work that's going on and pipeline, both for KLA what was our process control business and now as we talk about our process business, which is in semiconductor and also FPD and PCB.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren. Just going back to the gross margin, you said in the June quarter guide there sort of a one-time mix issue. Is that just more Orbotech revenue or just going on in the mix with the core KLA business. Then as we think about the full-year gross margin, is it pretty much a linear progression September, December to get to that number Or how are we thinking about exit trajectory of gross margin and what's driving the improvement? Is this overall mix of business? Or is it you actually getting your hands on the Orbotech asset and driving some cost synergies?","Bren Higgins","Yes, John, thanks for the question. So, consistent with the commentary around revenue growth, we expect gross margin to improve quarter-on-quarter as we progress through the year. So on the core KLA business we saw little bit more revenue in the June quarter.","We'll see versus March and the mix of the business, particularly around reticle inspection where we've had some higher mixed mashup business and that's being offset by some fab business, which we're very happy with the penetration in performance there, but the margin profile is different. So we do see pretty wide swings around those products depending on what segment you're shipping into.","So I do think that it's all kind of coming together into a lower profile in the June quarter, and we would expect to see it improve through the second half. I would say the same thing about the Orbotech business given the rapid growth there. And certainly, over time as we execute on synergies and we're doing a lot of planning today, but we would expect to see that sort of start to flow through the model certainly around supply chain, internal supply and other things.","It will take a little bit of time for that to happen. So I think the trajectory moves that way. June is a little bit weaker with the tools that we ship or the tools that we shipped and how that profile plays out is how it influences the mix. But overtime, structurally, we feel pretty good about where the margin profile is overall on the KLA business and there's opportunities on the Orbotech side over time.","John Pitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J., your line is now open.","C.J. Muse","Great, thank you. Thank you taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins, just wanted to clarify the 59.5% to 60.5% commentary. Was that for all of calendar 2019 or is that expected range for the back half 2019? And as part of that, could you walk through I guess the margin contributions across the three sub-segments within Orbotech, and if you can't be terribly precise perhaps rank order highest to lowest that would be very helpful? Thanks.","Bren Higgins","Sure, CJ. So the guidance for the calendar year, obviously includes March and June, and then what we expect in the second half. So when you're thinking about the calendar year profile that's in the margin profile be to achieve that you need to see the margins improve in the second half.","And I would say in the upper end of the range that I provided for the full calendar year. So hopefully that helps from a modeling perspective. On the Orbotech business, I think on the specialty semi side, the easiest way to think about the three businesses, is especially the semi side tends to be in the mid-50s plus or minus, you're probably in the high-40s on PCB and you're probably in the mid to high-30s generally on FPD.","Now FPD piece has a lot to do with the business levels, given the leverage that in that model given the higher level cyclicality for that business. That's the smallest part of Orbotech, as you to think about the three businesses. So certainly over time, given the expectations of growth around the specialty side, we would expect to see the mix improve in terms of the gross margin profile.","C.J. Muse","That's very helpful. And as my follow up I guess at a higher level, can you talk through how you're partnering with Amichai and the rest of the Orbotech team to drive top line synergies and I think you guys so clearly see in both the specialty semi and PCB side, what kind of groups perhaps you've created and what the timeline is to start to see those revenue synergies hit the model? Thank you.","Richard Wallace","Sure. This is Rick. There are two things going at once. Orbotech was a successful company standalone for a number of years and has been successful in growing their business. So on the one hand, we've been very mindful of that as we began integration to let them to continue to work together as not quite separate, but continue to drive their business independently.","However, over the last couple of months, we've seen customers actually ask us for to work together and we've seen some opportunities to do that. So that's really a slow roll out. We're going to detail this in quite a bit when we come in September for our Analyst Day, and we're going to talk more about it, but it is very encouraging especially in the specialty semiconductor where we do have customer overlap, no product overlap, the customer overlap looking for more capability.","And I also think there are some customers that specialty semiconductor division was working on and the addition of KLA to the portfolio for them makes it more likely that we'll gain share and also market share there. So we think there's great opportunity. And the other business is maybe a little bit more of some cost synergies as we work through some of the operational opportunities we have there and then their supply chain, which kind of covers those two businesses also where will continue to drive that. But again, that's something we're going to lay out in more detail as we do our Analyst Day in September.","Bren Higgins","The other thing I'll add on that one is that, as you think about the PCB business and advanced printed circuit board technology is you are starting to see more blending between advanced packaging in PCB on the roadmap for our customers as they try to drive cost in capability improvements.","And so, certainly, we have some exposure to that space, Orbotech does as well. So we're investigating what - how that strategy might play out and certainly how technology might be applicable as we start to think about the growth exists there. So early days on a lot of this work, but certainly something we'll outline in more detail when we get to the meeting in September.","C.J. Muse","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Krish, your line is now open.","Krish Sankar","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Bren, I don't know if I missed it, if you strip out the Orbotech revenues in March and June, is the core legacy KLA business growing? So is it like low-to-mid single, just want to get color on that, and I had a follow-up?","Bren Higgins","Yes, so in the prepared remarks, so against the guidance we gave in January, we guided for a midpoint on revenue of $920 million. We came in at $936 million. And then for the June quarter, we talked about shipments of approximately $1 billion. And also some comments around with 606, this transition to successfully expand that there isn't much difference between shipments and revenues.","So hopefully that gives you the color. And again, it's consistent with what we thought in terms of March being a bottom and expecting to see growth in the June quarter and sequentially for the remainder of the calendar year. So, if you think about the broader performance of the business given the mix of WFE, yes, most of the decline is driven by DRAM, into a lesser extent, the decline in NAND.","But you also have significant growth in foundry and logic. We're also seeing investments that are happening and reticle and in wafer. So, when you add all that together, our expectations is you see process control intensity improved in the year, but also that our relative performance relative to the industry should be better. So I think it's playing out the way we thought. And we're pleased with our market position and how we're seeing in the segments play out.","Krish Sankar","Got it. That's very helpful. Bren, and then a question for Rick. It looks like you guys are getting some traction in the EUV inspection side. EUV in theory is going to replace some of the multi-patterning steps. So if you look at it on the inspection side, is it fair to assume that EUV inspection will replace some of the regular inspections and net-net it's a neutral impact for you guys? Do you think there's actually growth did you inspection?","Richard Wallace","Process control intensity goes up with EUV. That's clear. And it does so because of the additional requirements associated with the reticle inspection is going to just the stakes are higher with those reticles. And I also think you're going to see more focus on print call. So you're going to have more optical inspection as well.","Not to mention some of the challenges, we're going to have with overlay when they get to multi-pattern. And so I think there is good reason to believe that we'll see intensity go up over time. Now, when you think about how much of the market is really EUV at this time, it's a pretty small number. So that percentage is going to take some time to accumulate but it's definitely increase intensity.","Krish Sankar","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. You're line is now open.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on the memory side of the business. Sounds like DRAM is weak as well 3D NAND in your June comments, I think you said memory increases to 47% of shipments from 38% of shipments. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color, what's going on there? And then my follow-up question is on the bare wafer inspection segment. It looks like Gartner's reporting that segment increased something like 87% in 2018. How do you see that part of the business in 2019? Thank you.","Richard Wallace","Yes, on the shipment profile, the shipments to memory customers are higher in the June quarter. There's a couple of big projects that we expect to ship to both in the DRAM and the flash side. So I think in terms of the second half of the year, we'll see how that plays out and we'd expect increasing momentum as we move through the year, but we do have higher shipment levels to both segments of memory in the quarter related principally to two or three projects.","On the bare wafer side, we've seen a lot of growth in that business. I mean, 2018 was a great year and 2019 was flat to 2018. And it's not just the bare wafer customers as much as it's also on pattern inspection and metrology overall, which has been driven by the high levels of memory investment. So, you have capacity requirements, but you also had changing specifications for metrology and the cleanliness requirements for 3D NAND is driving a lot of investment in that product. So we would expect similar results in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018 in that business against the backdrop of the declines in the WFE market.","Now as we move to 2020, I would expect some of that capacity on the wafer side too - those that demand on the wafer side to pull back a bid calendar 2020 still much higher sustaining level given the requirements I talked about. But we would expect for this year and to be very consistent with what we saw last year.","Quinn Bolton","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line as to shear off Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya, your line is now open.","Toshiya Hari","Yes, great. Thanks for taking the question. You guys provided long-term growth expectations for Orbotech when you guys announced the deal. I think it was 15% for semiconductor devices, 13% for display and 8% for PCB. Have those numbers changed at all given the developments over the past 12 months?","Richard Wallace","Yes. So we put those numbers are very consistent with the year 2020 model that tech had presented probably back in 2017. So look the assumptions move around, certainly these lay assumptions move around, I would say I'm probably more optimistic on the semiconductor side and a little less. So on the display side. But overall, the expectations for that business, which 2020 model I believe was $1.25 billion.","I feel pretty good about that at least today based on the path that we see to get there. Obviously, the size of these markets and how the electronics market and markets play out will influence that. But we haven't seen anything at a top level that, that we think this way this from that view that, they should be able to achieve the 2020 plan that we laid out when we announce the transaction.","Toshiya Hari","Okay, great. And Bren as a quick follow-up on synergies is $50 million over the next six quarters still the right way to think about synergies from Orbotech? And I guess related to that, what sort of OpEx synergies are embedded in your June and back half guidance of $370 million to $375 million? Thank you.","Bren Higgins","Yes, very little is embedded. We targeted a time frame of 12 to 24 months. We're doing that work now, I think just given the timing of how those actions could play out and how you see it flow out of the model, it'd probably be - we start to see some benefit towards the very tail end of the year. So limited synergies are forecasted in the guidance again, both for OpEx and for top line. So - but our goal is $50 million, by the $50 million run rate by the end of 12 to 24 months from the transaction and we feel pretty comfortable with the ability to get there. We'll see how it plays out, I would say, it's probably more $20 million to $25 million in OpEx and maybe $25 million to $30 million in the COGS volumes.","Toshiya Hari","Great. Thanks for the color.","Bren Higgins","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Deutsche Bank. Patrick, your line is now open.","Shek Ming Ho","Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in your comments regarding China, you said the industry spending to be down, however, with the memory market in China going through some significant yield issues. Could you see KLA outperforming, I guess that outlook based on increasing process control intensity to help them along their development curve?","Richard Wallace","Yes, both things are true. We do see overall market coming down as we said memory down, China maybe a little less. And we're continue to be strong as we help them in terms of some of their aspirations about driving these new processes. So yes, we do see intensity higher there we should outgrow in China.","Shek Ming Ho","Great. Maybe as my follow-up question on the EUV inspection side of things, you've talked about the limited availability to date, primarily on the foundry logic side of things, how do you see the memory market, particularly DRAM in terms of its adoption and how it could influence your EUV inspection bias?","Richard Wallace","There is some adoption there. I would say it's from our perspective, we're going to be engaged if that happens. I think like everyone, they're going to look at the cost benefit of doing that versus the alternatives probably most pronounced via formation. So I think that we're going to see the opportunities there as they come. But I would say it's much more limited in memory then relative to logic or foundry.","Shek Ming Ho","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Atif, your line is now open.","Atif Malik","Thank you for taking my questions. Rick, since you start to move to 7-nanometer, 6, 5, 5.5 just seems like there are just a smaller and smaller increments in terms of the shrinkage. Can you just talk about within there like $10 billion to $11 billion kind of CapEx outlook are you expecting your sales to grow as a leading foundries move in smaller steps?","Richard Wallace","We do. Before I want to correct something I just said, it's the storage note on DRAM, that's something that, not the VF formation. In terms of increasing intensity for the foundries, absolutely, I think the challenge for the foundries is yield at these advanced nodes. And as you know, as you push these the stress on EUV increases in terms of - or the economic viability.","So we're going to see process control intensity throughout really the supply chain, whether it's in - you have to make the reticles and that's a challenging prospect now and maybe the most challenging. So between reticle formation and the print down onto the wafer to make sure you have clean images. I think that's a challenge to make sure that the defectivity is low.","So we're seeing demand in the design sign to form these - the early tape-outs, and then we'll see it in production. So as the note scale, I think they're going to be largely driven on the economics of those nodes as it drives our customers.","Atif Malik","Okay. And then when we would at SPIE conference earlier this year, there was a discussion on stochastic defects. But the message here was that the chipmakers need help from every type of inspection equipment, whether it's e-beam or optical, just because these issues is far greater than anyone expected. Is your view on e-beam that it's still will be available as a combination to optical as part of your strategy. Is that still your strategy or you've had a changed strategy?","Richard Wallace","No real change. I mean, we've talked about leveraging e-beam platform to do some of the inspections on the reticle itself and that's a reticle without a pellicle just to validate the design. But when you do - when you print down and you're trying to model and manage the stochastic implications, you really need optical for that, because you need to have enough throughput to be able to cover enough area. So it's certainly going to be a blended approach by our customers and we are committed to having all the capabilities that they need","Atif Malik","Thanks","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions on queue.

In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Wallace","Thanks, Ed. I'm pleased to report that KLA-Tencor delivered record shipments, revenue and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the September quarter, the results of continued successful execution of our long-term strategies and demonstrating once again the critical nature of process control in enabling growth and innovation in the semiconductor industry. Q3 results featured strong demand from memory customers and from the Japan and China regions.","New orders in September were a record for the third calendar quarter, and new orders have now totaled approximately $3 billion on a year-to-date basis in calendar 2017. Coupled with our market leadership and supported by strong backlog, these results point to continued momentum of growth for KLA-Tencor and position the company to deliver new highs for revenue and earnings and strong stockholder returns in 2017 and 2018. This is a very exciting time for the company given our market and technology leadership. The road ahead features more opportunity for the industry, our company and for our stockholders than ever before.","Before I turn the call over to Bren, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight how our strategies for customer success, innovation, productivity and talent are helping to drive KLA-Tencor's record-setting performance today and are building a solid foundation for continued growth in the future. The first and most enduring objective for KLA-Tencor is customer success enabled by the use of our process control solutions. To achieve this goal, we focus on partnering with our customers to help empower their growth. We drive engagement to enable us to develop differentiated solutions for our customers, most complex yield challenges in the current node and the anticipated yield challenges in future technologies.","The rapid growth of our China business is an example of how successful execution of collaboration and customer success strategies are fueling growth. China's investment and their domestic semiconductor industry is driving an inflection for the overall WFE market, and KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong both in terms of process control adoption and market share. Business levels in this region are expected to grow significantly in calendar year 2017, and this momentum should continue through 2018.","The focus on innovation at KLA-Tencor is tightly integrated with our customer success efforts. We are investing in a very high level to drive innovation in process control and deliver a steady stream of advanced solutions and services that will enable our customers to succeed with their most critical technologies. Today, we are developing 5 major technology platforms, 2 of which are targeted specifically at memory, and we're modeling higher process control adoption and record revenue from memory customers in 2017.","For example, growth from memory customers is a key factor in the record business levels we're experiencing in our bare wafer inspection and metrology products. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new capacity to ramp wafer demand, and IC customers are moving to higher-layer accounts and increasingly more complex architectures. In this environment, our new bare wafer products are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies.","I'm also excited to report that our Gen 5 broadband plasma wafer inspection platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. We're seeing increasing utilization of installed tools with our advanced logic and foundry customers where the unique value of Gen 5's illumination wavelength range is being demonstrated on 7-nanometer discovery and EUV print check applications. Based on these results and customer's feedback, we expect Gen 5 to continue to support customers in development of 7-nanometer technology, and we see it playing an even larger role on the development and ramp of the 5-nanometer node.","A third component of our strategic objectives is productivity and the commitment to operational excellence. Through continuous execution of these strategies, our growth and market leadership results in industry-leading margins and cash flow and provides the resources for future investment and ongoing strong returns to stockholders.","And finally, our focus on talent. KLA-Tencor's talent initiatives are centered on attracting, developing and inspiring our global workforce. We recruit top talent worldwide from experienced candidates as well as high-caliber graduates from leading universities. Ultimately, success of our execution on talent strategies lie at the core of our long-term success.","So to summarize. Clearly, this is an exciting time for KLA-Tencor with the company reporting another quarter of record results in Q3 and demonstrating the strength of our strategic objectives in an environment of very strong overall industry demand. Looking ahead to 2018, given our anticipated backlog entering the year and the momentum we are experiencing today, the stage is set for another outstanding record-setting year for KLA-Tencor.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter featured another record results for the company driven by memory demand and solid operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments were a record $977 million, revenue was at the top end of the range and GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance for the quarter. This result was driven by continued strong demand across our product portfolio with particular strength from memory, wafer and captive mask shop customers.","Our manufacturing and service organizations continue to deliver strong operational leverage on our revenue growth with incremental gross margins in excess of 80% over the last 2 quarters. Revenue and earnings per share were also records in Q3. Revenue was $970 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.78. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.80. In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focus on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now turning to highlights for the September quarter demand environment in terms of shipments. Foundry was 40% of shipments in September driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry shipments to be approximately 20% of the total in the December quarter. Memory was 46% of shipments with deliveries evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling shipments to memory customers to be about 67% of the total in the December quarter with NAND representing about 55% of the memory mix. Logic was 14% of shipments in September and is currently forecasted to be approximately flat in the December quarter.","Regarding the approximate distribution of shipments by product group. Wafer inspection was 46% of shipments; patterning was 30%, patterning includes shipments from our reticle inspection business; non-semi, which includes our back-end component inspection business, was approximately 3%; and service was 21% of shipments.","Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion. At this point, we expect shipments for the first half of calendar year 2018 to grow in the low single digits compared with the second half of 2017 and be roughly equally balanced half-over-half over the course of the year. This outlook is strengthened since our last earnings call in July.","Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $970 million in September, finishing at the top of the range of guidance, and we expect revenue to be in the range of $930 million to $990 million in the December quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.7%, above the range of expectations for the quarter. The stronger-than-expected gross margins in the quarter were due to a number of favorable factors in the systems business, including the favorable product mix and better-than-modeled parts expense and labor utilization in the service business. Looking forward to the December quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 64% as we expect a similar product and service mix quarter-to-quarter with commensurate cost dynamics in our manufacturing service operations.","Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $252 million in September, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%. This operating margin result is in line with our updated target model for annual revenue levels in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range that we outlined earlier in the year. We are modeling operating expense levels to be approximately $260 million in the December quarter due to the expensing of significant prototype materials and other expenses related to technology development programs targeting reticle process control for EUV high-volume manufacturing applications. Given company revenue expectations for CY '18, we are currently sizing operating expense levels next year to be approximately $250 million per quarter, consistent with our public operating model. ","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17% in Q3 and below the guided rate of 20% for the quarter, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and certain other discrete items impacting the tax rate. For the December quarter, we expect the tax rate of 18% due to similar factors.","For calendar '18, we are adjusting our long-term planning tax rate down to 20% largely due to the anticipated revenue mix in the year. We intend to update our tax rate guidance periodically based on the revenue expectations. Finally, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter was $284 million, and we ended the quarter with 158 million diluted shares outstanding.","Turning now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, an increase of $40 million compared with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $374 million in September, and free cash flow was $358 million. We paid $156 million towards our outstanding term loan in the quarter and expect to retire our outstanding $250 million 2.375% 3-year senior notes upon maturity in November. Finally, during Q3, we paid an aggregate of $100 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units.","In conclusion, today's results reflect our continued market leadership, the critical nature of process control in all customer segments and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by expected strong total backlog as of the end of the calendar year, position the company for continued growth in the strong and stable overall WFE industry environment. Given consensus expectations for WFE growth in the mid- to high single digits next year, our expectations for another year of strong memory investment, improving process control intensity in memory, contributions from new products and continued high single-digit annual growth in services, we are modeling total revenue in the $4 billion range in 2018. Against this revenue backdrop, operating performance is expected to be in line with the $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion annual revenue range outlined in our public business model.","With that, to conclude, our guidance for the December quarter is shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion, revenue between $930 million and $990 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.58 to $1.82 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.59 to $1.83 per share. The December quarter EPS guidance range assumes an 18% tax rate in the quarter.","This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Theodore Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","My first question is on the outlook for 2018. Can you just talk about what segments have strengthened since your last outlook? And in terms of foundry versus memory, where do you see growth and where do you see kind of flattish?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Farhan. So I think since last -- it's Bren. So since the last call, certainly our expectations for next year has strengthened over the last 3 months, and we're seeing that in our outward forecast, which I provided some details to you in this call. I think when we look at the data, I think with the investments that are happening in 3D NAND, I think we still continue to expect that to be very strong. DRAM also looks like it's probably stronger now than what we thought a few months ago, and I think foundry\/logic is flattish. I think logic will be slightly higher. But overall, I think the foundry\/logic segment will be largely flattish and probably more second half weighted as we see it flow through our shipment profile over the course of the year.","Farhan Ahmad","And then one question on the print check. Have you guys sized what could be the potential opportunity for print check? And what is the customer interest that you are seeing right now?","Richard Wallace","Farhan, you mean specifically for EUV?","Farhan Ahmad","Yes, specifically for EUV in terms of print check technology, how large that market could be.","Richard Wallace","Yes. Okay. Well, let's start with development and then think about HVM. For development, there's a lot of work. In fact, a fair amount of capacity of the Gen 5 systems are being used for print check and development. So I'd say that I don't think it consumes a tool right now, but it consumes part of the use case of a tool for us. When we get into HVM, it gets a little different. It depends on how big we think the adoption of EUV is and when. But we would expect that, that market grows because of just essentially the available technology for inspecting reticles. And so that will drive the print check market higher because there won't be an actinic tool for in-fab reticle for the first wave of tools. So I think you'd see it grow in size from them. We haven't sized it exactly, but I think for every company that adopts EUV in production, as the EUV scales, the applications for print check will grow commensurate. So maybe it gets to a couple tools per customer that are driving that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Just kind of follows up to the last question and based on some of your prepared commentary, it looks like you guys have seen some momentum on your reticle inspection platforms. And we've heard that at 7-nanometer EUV mask inspection, it's Teron platform plus Gen 5 print check. For 5-nanometer and below, though, it's kind of interesting because I think at the recent SPIE technical symposium, I think the KLA team actually talked about a multi-beam e-beam platform for EUV reticle inspection targeted at 5 nanometers and below. Can you guys just give us some more insights on this new multi-beam tool that you're developing? What are the benefits versus current generation? When is it going to be available? I know 5 nanometers is still a few years away, but I would imagine maybe some time in 2019? Any color there would be great.","Richard Wallace","Sure, Harlan. So the strategy for reticle inspection, as you mentioned, Teron right now is serving the need. And I think for customers, as they implement 7, whatever degree, 7 is going to be implemented, Teron with the combination with the Gen 5 for print check is the most economical and efficient solution for our customers. But you're right to point out that a 5-nanometer, our view was we will need more sensitivity on the reticle. Rather than design an inspection tool -- an e-beam inspection tool and modify a wafer tool and make it for reticle, we decided a couple years ago, several years ago, to target specifically the reticle market with a platform optimized for reticle inspection and being developed by a fair number of players from our platform that develop reticle tools for us. So we think we have a lot of expertise. We feel very good about that progress of that, and we are targeting introduction of that tool in the 2019 time frame to intercept 5-nanometer.","Bren Higgins","Hey, Harlan, it's Bren. One other point I'll make, and I said this is in prepared remarks, but one of the uplift that we're seeing, the onetime uplift we're seeing to our operating expenses here in the December quarter, is driven by some prototype investment that we're expensing for this program. So Rick's characterization of timing seems to make sense and program's progressing according to plan.","Harlan Sur","Great. And then your commentary on China suggests that you guys are seeing some of the activity on some of the China domestic memory R&D pilot programs. I think they're trying to show up in your pipeline. Are you going to be shipping some of these tools here this quarter? Or is this more kind of the first half of next year? And secondly, on the domestic China business, you guys have always said that process control intensity in general is about 100 basis points higher versus the mainstream guys. Is that kind of how it's playing out?","Bren Higgins","So Harlan, on your first part of your question, so for the new memory projects and there's about 3 significant ones that we're tracking, we booked some orders back in the June quarter for a DRAM project that we will start to ship at the end of this quarter, right at the tail end of this quarter for installation into next quarter. The -- we also booked in this quarter significant orders for a 3D NAND project, and so we'll see those orders probably ship out towards the June quarter time frame. So to answer your question, we will see that business start to come to the P&L next year. ","This year was more memory weighted as I described and probably a little over double in terms of the bookings from -- in China versus last year. And as we look at 2018, the order profile looks like it's flat to up from there. So a significant amount of activity there. Obviously, based on success with these Phase 1 investments, we play a pretty significant role early on as they're ramping the fabs. And so process control intensity is higher. Share tends to be better also because of the -- just the experience we can bring to help these customers navigate their yield and ramp these fabs quickly. And obviously, in memory, being able to progress the technology road map matters a lot to the economics of these projects.","Richard Wallace","But just to add to that, I think -- remember the greenfield, in particular, these are not at-scale fabs. So we're at the front end where the intensity is higher as Bren was saying. I think the other advantage we will have in the memory market in China is some of the platforms that we've been developing for memory will come to maturity in time to support those, so we'll see process control intensity higher. But the investors in China and the fab managers are very focused on efficiency in all their investments, so we don't see them necessarily higher. It's more that the fabs are subscale and at the beginning of the ramp.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.","Christopher Muse","First question on gross margins. Can you walk through what's driving the uplift in the December quarter? Is that simply just the greater revenues? And as you think to 2018, you outlined gross margin in line with your target model, 62%, 63%. Though if I look back in the last 4, 5, 6 quarters, you definitely hover around 63%, if not higher. So curious what we should be thinking about mix-wise that might drive that to the mid-point of your target model or whether you're just being conservative a bit.","Bren Higgins","Yes, on the last part first, C.J., I think that as we look at next year and look at the expected mix of business, we're likely going to see sustaining tailwinds that we've experienced in gross margin and we'll see that continue into next year. So as I'm modeling next year, I'm modeling it between 63% to may be as high as 64% over the course of the year. So pretty -- I think it continues, and what's driving it is a lot of the same factors. I mean, clearly, the product positioning and the differentiation and value we're adding to customers is playing out in the product pricing. I think the introduction of new products over the last 12 months or so -- the engineering execution has been great, so we've been able to climb up the cost curve pretty quickly on warranty and installation and some of those kind of things. We've been able to get a fair amount of leverage out of our service business as we've added tools into Korea and Taiwan. We can leverage the resources pretty well. So all in all, I think there's a number of factors, and I think that they're fairly sustaining as we progress into next year.","Christopher Muse","Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, if you think about the greenfield activity that's flowing through today, typically, that would be the ideal time for you guys in terms of process control intensity. So curious to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing both from a logic foundry perspective as well as from a memory perspective.","Bren Higgins","Well, I think Rick talked about from a memory perspective and what we're seeing in China. I think for the established customers, I mean, to that point, I mean, there is a participation -- a higher level of participation as they outfit a new fab on the front end. And then over time, the customer will probably scale back as they ramp that fab, as we generally see across a fab ramp. China is unique. Rick talked about that. And on foundry\/logic, I don't think that there's anything different. I think it sort of follows the same model. There's a fair amount of development activity that happens upfront, and we participate above what the normal ramp level or the normal intensity levels are. And then over time as customers move from defect discovery to line monitoring, they tend to try to optimize a little bit more for fab productivity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company.","Yeuk-Fai Mok","So first, I guess, just kind of look a little longer term. I think you guys provided some color for 2018, including kind of outlook for second half of '18. Just curious, that's by a few quarters away. It seems like you have better visibility now than before. What gives you that better confidence? What's improving in visibility for you guys?","Bren Higgins","Well, so the statements were about the shipment profile. And as we look at this point and we look at the shipment profile into the second half of the year, it looks like based on the backlog we're bringing into the year and our expectations for orders in the first half gives us pretty good views into shipments into the second half. So we feel, at least at this point, it looks reasonably balanced across the year. And we're in this range of about $1 billion of shipments plus or minus $50 million as we look at our plan over the next several quarters. So it's still a ways out, and things can change. But based on how customers are slotting and how we're planning our manufacturing operations, that's how it looks.","Yeuk-Fai Mok","Okay. That's fair. Second question I have is on the service side of the businesses. If I look at some of your peers and some of other equipment manufacturer, they're actually seeing pretty strong growth in service, double-digit kind of growth rate, which is higher than historical. Do you see that being possible for your service business? Or you think that kind of a mid-single digit is a reasonable growth rate for your service business?","Bren Higgins","Well, service looks like in calendar '17 will grow about 10%. Now its historical growth rate has been about 8%, if you go back to, let's say, 2000 or so and play that through. Now it grows every year, as it should, as the installed base is growing. So we are seeing an acceleration in service, and we were open with this in our last discussion of just our modeling for the business over the long run that we think service can maintain its historical growth rate. So we think service runs probably 7% to 9% over time. And part of what's driving it obviously is the growth of the installed base, but also the mature and legacy fabs and how they're running those fabs now to meet IoT and automotive demand and so on. So we're adding new capacity to some of those tools. They're running the tools harder, so they're running them longer, and so the contract and billable streams are nice. And one thing about our service business is it's about 70% to 75% service contract. So it's a very predictable stream that we can build our cost structure around and move forward with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Can you remind us how you view process control intensity in memory going forward over the next couple of years? And I know you guys are working on a couple of initiatives in memory from a product development perspective. How big could the opportunity be with those initiatives over the next, say, 12 to 24 months?","Bren Higgins","Yes, so on process control intensity for in and around memory, I think at planar NAND versus 3D NAND and DRAM, DRAM was always around 9%. Planar NAND was probably 8% or so. And if we look at across total memory today, we're in that 9% to 10% range. Clearly, as we've been talking about for several months, we think there are some opportunities not only for more inspection in terms of various defectivity in 3D NAND, but also opportunities in and around metrology as metrology's much more intensive for 3D structures than planar structures. One thing that's also been driving our business is the increasing specs around flatness and wafer flatness for 3D NAND. And so we've seen our wafer customers investing more new capability to be able to produce wafers for the IC customers to be able to meet that spec challenge. That doesn't show up necessarily in some of our pure IC numbers from memory, but it's certainly a derivative effect that's positive. So we think we make some progress on these 2 offerings that we think that, that can probably drive to an opportunity that can be $200 million to $300 million across both platforms. I don't think you'll see that in '18. There's an adoption time line that's associated with that. But over time, it could be -- if we can solve the problem, I think there's an opportunity that's in that magnitude.","Toshiya Hari","Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, you guys have talked about your business with some of the wafer manufacturers and even some of the mask shops. I guess you made some comments in your prepared remarks. I guess these are 2 customer groups that perhaps some of your peers don't necessarily have access to. So I guess I was curious, how big is -- how big are these 2 customer groups as a percentage of sales today? And what's kind of the outlook into 2018 when you think about their spending patterns?","Richard Wallace","Well, we don't break it out, but it is significant. And it is often the case that when there are new specs is when -- and new products is when we see new adoption of technologies. So it isn't something we break out, but it is significant, especially for certain of our products. Bare wafer inspection we mentioned and also flatness we mentioned as being critical. And then of course, in the mask shops, it's the reticle tools both for overlay -- registration, but also for defect inspection. But pretty significant, but usually, the investment cycle on those is a little bit more in waves and less of an annual basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone.","Jagadish Iyer","Rick, I have two questions. First, on -- you had a nice uptick in the patterning segment in the September quarter. What is the real driver for it, please?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Jagadish, this is Bren. So that was reticle inspection. And so we had a couple of tools that we booked in the quarter focused for -- on EUV development activities from captive mask shops.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to understand, now as EUV starts to make initial insertion next year, how should we think about the overall kind of the process control market given all the puts and takes about how multi-patterning could be changing at least in '18 and 2019? Any high-level thoughts here?","Richard Wallace","Sure. I think there are a couple of things to think about. The net of it all is we're not, at this point, capable of really seeing a big change in process control intensity, but it does move to different parts of our business. For example, right now we know there's even more pressure on wafer manufacturers for flatness for EUV. So there's an example where we'll get more. And what seems like perhaps unrelated, we also think that the Gen 5 application and adoption will be higher to support EUV print check but also initial production. There are fewer layers.","So some of the films areas, we'll reduce -- the number of steps, we'll reduce, but there are new defect types. So right now when we model, we don't see a lot of difference in terms of overall capacity, and we have a number of flows that are what we believe the process flow would look like depending on the success of EUV. Where it will start to matter more and it's already impacting some is in reticle inspection, both with the Teron and then when we talk about later as we get to new capability 2019 for the gen -- or for the 5-nanometer and beyond, we'll see increase adoption as we go forward there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.","J. Ho","Maybe as a follow-up to the last question on EUV, given the lack of actinic inspection tools at least at the outset, is there the potential, as it goes to high-volume manufacturing, that you could see increasing intensity for optical inspection at least at the outset to offset the lack actinic inspection?","Richard Wallace","Patrick, no. I don't think so. I think that the high-volume, if it's done in the current generation of EUV will be served by the Teron platform. I think when we get to the high NA production for EUV, which will come at the sub-5 probably in maybe 2022, 2023 time frame, that's when there'll be a need for the EUV reticle tool, but also potentially actinic tools at that time frame. But we don't see a need for them before that. We think we're fully covering the market in the next few years with the toolsets that we have.","J. Ho","Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question in terms of China. You talked about some of the memory fabs that you guys are tracking and where you're seeing the activity already start in terms of process control buy. How do you look at, I guess, some of the logic and foundry fabs that are also starting to develop in China and some of the opportunity that even though it is going to be a little more mainstream and legacy nodes, what are some of the opportunities there for you given that even the 28-nanometer node does have high levels of process control intensity?","Richard Wallace","Well, we've already seen some of that, right, with established players. And they do invest and you have to, again, look at scale because those fabs tend to be bigger than the giga fabs elsewhere in the world for those nodes. So process control intensity, by that definition, is higher. We do see increased interest in those nodes. And those new facilities, of course, when they're greenfield and they're coming up, they don't have the option of reusing any other equipment, so we do see opportunity there. So we think that there will be continued opportunity. And initially, we didn't see, I'd say a year ago, so we weren't envisioning the memory that we're seeing now in China, but we actually were anticipating logic. So it's something we've been prepared for and even have, in some cases, restarted old lines to support them with products that are more appropriate for those design rules.","Bren Higgins","If I look at the mix -- yes, just one other comment. If I look at the mix for calendar '18, it looks like it's slightly more foundry weighted than memory. Calendar '17 was more memory weighted; '16 was foundry. So I would expect more foundry investment in '18 from that region, and that's the native China business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","Just a question on the dividend. If I look at your dividend payout right now, it's somewhere around 30% to 32% for this year, next year earnings. And your long-term model, you've talked about 40% to 50% range. So how should we think about the dividend going forward? Are you planning to stick to the 40% to 50% range?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Farhan, it's a good question. I mean, clearly, we raised the dividend back in June, and we raised it almost 10%. Our model -- and the business has strengthened and the performance has been very strong. So clearly, we've outpaced that target. I mean, that's -- when we talk about that target being in that sort of 40% to 50% range, that's a 3-cycle target over time. We think about it that way because you're going to have periods you maybe under it when business is strong, but business [indiscernible] obviously want to build it to be able to not only just maintain it, but also raise it in weaker times.","So over time, we target the growth rate of the total dividend payout versus the growth rate in earnings. And so if you look at our model right now where we see the top line growing 6% to 8%, we think we can grow the bottom line greater than 10% on that, that we'd grow the dividend payout in that greater than 10% range. So there's a couple different ways you can look at it. I mean, clearly, as the business continue to grow and we've raised it now with 6 or 7 years in a row. So this is a very consistent process on an annual basis, and we'll run through that process again as we complete our strategic planning process for the year.","Richard Wallace","And also, Farhan, as you can imagine, if there were a change in tax policy and we had access to more of that cash, we would revisit the payout ratio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Just kind of following up in terms of capital return. So it looks like you guys are going to get to your target gross debt level of $2.5 billion some time very soon. I think you guys are already at your target leverage ratio. So in a pretty short period of time, you're going to have a lot of strong excess free cash flow. You obviously have had a strategy of, number one, investing in the business; and then secondarily, a strong focus on capital return. So how do you guys think about uses for this excess free cash flow, i.e., something like turning on a stock repurchase program?","Bren Higgins","Well, so we started buying back some modest levels of stock a couple quarters ago. And you're right on all accounts, right? As we get through next quarter, we retire this note next month. We will be consistent with the commitments that we made back when we restructured the capital structure of the company back in 2014. So given the strength of the business, we're below our leverage levels. And so there is -- it's not necessarily a compelling reason for us to continue to delever. And we would redirect, I believe, in the shorter term towards share repurchase. Now there is the U.S. and offshore cash dynamic in terms of cash flow. And given the strength of some of our product lines, I think that our U.S. cash flow into next year is probably at the lower end of the 60% to 70% target range that we've referenced in the past. ","But you're right, there will be some cash flow that will become available, and we'll run through our process. And first and foremost, we invest in our business, and we're doing that. And then secondly, as part of our -- capital structure is part of the company strategy. And so as we look at growth opportunities juxtaposed against shareholder return alternatives, it's part of our DNA and will be something that we will do. So I'll announce something when we have something.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you.","Theodore Lockwood","All right.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website.","There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risk. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are subject to those risks. And KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thanks, Ed. We're very pleased to report that June marked yet another exceptional quarter for KLA-Tencor, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each finishing at or above the range of guidance. New orders exceeded the $1 billion mark for the second time in the past three quarters.","Shipments were a record $971 million, and we ended June with backlog of $1.8 billion, which was also an all-time high level for the company. These numbers were once again driven by KLA-Tencor's ongoing market leadership, and strong execution of our strategic objectives, and are also reflective of the broad strength of today's overall WFE industry environment.","One factor that may not be evident in the reported numbers, but which is key to our positive outlook for continued strength in the overall demand environment, is the growing momentum in orders we've experienced in the first half of calendar 2017. In fact, since January, we have adjusted K-T's internal order forecast for CY 2017 to the upside by almost 20%, reflecting strengthening customer demand, driven by new products across each of our end markets, and leading to another excellent year of growth the company in 2017, while setting the stage for continued momentum into 2018.","Judging by the positive announcements recently of overall industry growth projections provided by our peers and other market participants, the strength KLA has experienced today is also broad based, which bodes well for the industry as we move ahead in the year.","Turning now to a discussion of some of the areas of near-term focus for the company, as we execute our growth strategies. As the market leader in process control, K-T plays an enabling role in driving our customers' growth strategies and long-term success. We do this by investing at a high level to drive innovation and process control and supply our customers with the advanced inspection metrology products and services that they require to advance their device technology roadmaps, and also resulting in expansion of the serve market opportunity for KLA-Tencor in the most critical applications and process control.","Along with the ongoing focus on investment and innovation, we're also continuously executing our strategies for operational excellence, and converting our growth and market leadership into industry-leading margins and cash flow, providing the fuel for future investment and resources for the ongoing strong cash returns to stockholders.","Drilling down a bit on the factors that are driving KLA-Tencor's performance, I will focus on three key drivers of our growth. First, expansion of the serve market opportunity in memory, driven by new products. Today, we are developing five new technology platforms, two of which are targeted specifically at memory. And we're expecting higher process control adoption and record revenue, from memory customers in CY 2017.","Growth from memory customers is already contributing to the record business levels we're experiencing in our bare wafer inspection and metrology markets, and we expect revenue from memory customers to continue to grow with the market.","Second, growth in China, which, as seen by many, is the next major new market inflection for WFE. We believe China could represent a generational opportunity in terms of investment and growth for our industry. Business levels in China for KLA-Tencor are expected to more than double in CY 2017. China represents a tremendous growth opportunity for KLA-Tencor and for process control as our customers in this region are adopting process control at a high level to speed yield learning in their development efforts, and to accelerate market entry.","And finally, services. Growth in the service business is historically driven by the expansion of our installed base of systems in the field. And this represents an annuity growth model to complement our systems business. Services growth is also driven by expanding investment in the trailing edge. This is resulting in legacy node fabs running at full utilization, and putting pressure on the equipment base to service, refurbish, remanufacture and upgrade process control systems as our customers continue to derive value from these assets. Quarterly service revenue topped $200 million for the first time in the June quarter. And we're modeling an annual revenue growth rate of 7% to 9% in services for the foreseeable future.","To sum up today's results before I turn the call over to Bren, June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating that company is executing well in a strong industry environment. Given our backlog, and with the momentum we're experiencing the marketplace, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for us. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, expanding our served market, and delivering strong profitability and cash flows.","We're growing our revenue with memory customers and we expect to see very strong growth in China, as customers view process control as a competitive advantage in their market growth strategy, and they look to KLA-Tencor as the market leader and partner.","I'll now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments were a record $971 million, finishing above the range of guidance, and revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management in our engineering, manufacturing and service operations.","Revenue was $939 million in the June quarter; GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62 in the quarter; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","Now, turning to highlights of the June quarter demand environment. Although we have discontinued guiding quarterly orders, beginning this quarter, we will begin to offer greater detail on our shipment results and guidance to provide more information and color on the current business environment to give investors insight into industry trends and KLA-Tencor's performance. For historical shipments mix data, please refer to the supplemental information posted with today's press release on our website.","So as a reminder, the following details are related to shipments: total shipments in the June quarter were a record $971 million, up 7% on a sequential basis and finishing above the guidance range. Foundry was 64% of shipments in June, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development, and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry shipments to be approximately 42% of the total in the September quarter.","Memory was 32% of shipments, with delivery evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling shipments to memory customers to be about 43% of the total in the September quarter, with NAND representing about half of the memory mix. Logic was 4% of shipments in June and is currently forecasted to be approximately 15% of the September quarter total.","In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 50% of shipments; patterning was 25%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business. Non-semi, which includes our back inspection business, was approximately 4%; and service was 21% of shipments.","Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels of $900 million to $1 billion, and we expect this trend to continue into calendar year 2018.","This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January, consistent with the upside in orders we've experienced year-to-date. In fact, compared to the outlook we provided back at our earnings call in April, the CY 2017 order forecast is over $225 million higher than three months ago, and shipments for the second half of calendar year 2017 are expected to be up mid-single digits compared with the first half, inclusive of the stronger-than-guided performance in the June quarter.","Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $939 million in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $910 million to $970 million in the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63%, in line with expectations for the quarter. The strong gross margin performance in June is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations.","Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%, flat at the midpoint compared with June, as we expect a similar mix of product revenue with slightly higher manufacturing costs, offset by an improved service mix quarter-to-quarter.","Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $238 million in June, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6%. This operating margin result is in line with the updated target model for annual revenue levels in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range as we outlined earlier in this quarter. We are modeling operating expense levels to be approximately $250 million in the September quarter due to increasing R&D head count and prototype material expense for current programs as well as approximately $2 million to $3 million of incremental operating expense associated with the acquisition of Zeta Instruments, a privately-held company that designs and manufactures optical profilers and defect inspection systems for the advanced wafer packaging, LED and data storage industries. We completed this small transaction in early June.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. We are modeling the September quarterly tax rate at 20% due to a non-recurring tax benefit expected in the quarter. However, you should continue to model a long-term tax rate of 22% going forward. Finally, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter was $259 million, and we ended the quarter with 158 million diluted shares outstanding.","I'll turn now to the highlights and the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, an increase of $313 million compared with the March quarter. Cash from operations was a record $463 million in June, and free cash flow was $452 million. As mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Zeta Instruments in the June quarter. Total purchase consideration was approximately $37 million, including cash paid of almost $32 million at closing. And finally, during the quarter, we paid an aggregate of $85 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units.","In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in June reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customer's growth strategies at the leading edge and in legacy design rules and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.8 billion as of the end of the June quarter, position the company for another year of growth in a strong and stable overall WFE industry environment. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of our portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading edge, and our focus on operational execution across our business.","With that, our guidance for the September quarter is: shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion; revenue between $910 million and $970 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.48 to $1.72 per share; as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.74 per share. This September quarter EPS guidance range assumes a 20% tax rate in the quarter.","This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to the questions. We do once again request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to re-enter the call as time permits. All right, Christine, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding EUV and what trends you are seeing in the business there. ASML recently talked about potentially using single lithography edge, which I would assume would require a lot of inspection as well because there is no pattern inspection. So maybe the need for the wafer inspection is at a higher level? So maybe can you just talk about EUV trends that you're seeing in the business?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes, Farhan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. We do see a lot of work around EUV, still from our customers working in the pilot phase and the technology development phase. But a lot of work, whether it's in reticle qual, which is still something that \u2013 there's a lot of challenges getting defect-free reticles. And then in terms of lithography qualifications when they're testing out the litho cell. But as you know, we're ways off from production, so it's pretty hard to anticipate exactly what the production use cases are going to be. But we're certainly seeing an increased amount of interest at our customers and kind of continuing our belief that we'll see HBM by 2019 and 2020.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Got it. Rick, you mentioned that you guys are working on five new platforms and two of them in specific to memory. How should we be thinking about the ramp of these products? And are any of these products something that will affect the revenues in 2018?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","2018, probably by the mid, later part of calendar year, we'll see some impact. I think we've talked before about I think about the overall increase in memory intensity. And I think if we look out, we're modeling about a 200 basis point increase in the intensity as we ramp these new products over the next couple of years. We'll already have a record for memory in calendar 2017, and we continue to see strength as we go forward.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes, Farhan, it's Bren. I think the only thing I would add to that is we're still waiting for these products and that contribution. But we have from a 3D NAND perspective, from planar NAND, we have seen intensity improve. If you think about the peripheral products around their wafer inspection and in metrology, where wafer flatness is really, really critical to advance layer developments, 3D NAND, film measurements, CE measurement, laser scanning, opportunities around defect inspection. Some of the bigger challenges are still out there that these platforms hopefully will address. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far, and as Rick said, it's a big part of our calendar 2017 view.","Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse","Thank you. That's all I had.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the quarterly execution. As it relates to the financial model, if I look at your free cash flow generation for the quarter, it was -- was it 400 \u2013 what was it? Was it $452 million in free cash flow for the quarter? I am sorry if I missed that number.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes, that's correct. It was pretty high. I mean, as you know, free cash flow can be pretty lumpy. But the linearity of shipments enabled our record collection quarter, so that was a big part of it this quarter. So we're real pleased with it and...","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's a 48% free cash flow margin. So maybe can you help us level set, Bren. So, in an environment where you're sort of operating sort of 36% to 38% operating margins, how do we think about the free cash flow margins underlying that?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, it's a great question and I think as our business has been so stable at these levels, we're not having to make significant investments in working capital. Obviously, we invested a lot in ramping inventory to prepare to be able to ship it, $900 million to $1 billion where we are today. And, so now you're seeing modest increases in inventory to support that activity. So then as a result of that, given our capital position and so on, we see a fair amount of the operating margin dropping through.","So the way I think of \u2013 I mean, when I look at calendar 2017, I probably see free cash flow probably in excess of $1.1 billion, and we're talking about revenue levels of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion if you take our guidance and expectation around the December quarter.","So you're in that 30th percentile ranges I think if I do the math quickly. So I think that's probably how we ought to think about it. I think if you see an inflection, obviously we'll have to invest into that. But the resiliency of the model is pretty strong. The margin profile of the business is good. And I think that a lot of the trends that I've outlined around gross margin is, I think, is fairly sustainable going forward. So, we feel pretty good about the model going forward, and the cash flow generation that comes from it.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then on China domestic memory, there are a number of programs that are going to start to put up either development lines or reproduction capabilities in 2018. You guys typically have a bit longer lead time. So I'm wondering, if you're just trying to see orders or at least tools showing up in your second half pipeline to support some of these early China-based memory programs? And as you've highlighted previously, China's spending intensity for process control, in general, tends to be a bit higher. And I'm just wondering, on these new memory programs, are you seeing that sort of higher spending intensity level?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, Harlan. As we mentioned in the call, the orders, the new bookings for the quarter were very strong, driven in part by activity in China, as you say, in anticipation of having deliveries late calendar or maybe early in 2018.","So yeah, we are seeing that. And agree with your suggestion, part of what we see overall in the strength of China going forward is broad participation across the board and these projects are absolutely real and they're backed with funding and we're pretty excited about the opportunity there.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, Harlan, I think the only thing I'll add to that is, is that the first part of \u2013 well, all of 2016 and part of 2017 was very foundry-centric. We thought most of the memory bookings we would start to see in calendar 2018. And I think one of the things that we've been encouraged by, is the strength of what we've seen from an order perspective, both in the June quarter but also what's in the funnel over the next couple of quarters.","So those are tools that are slotted to ship early in 2018. So from a shipment and revenue perspective, they're into next year. But as Rick said, those projects are clearly real and are moving quickly and we're preparing to ship into that in the first part of next year.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good to see the traction. Thank you.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, as you think about China and their emergence as a key spender here on equipment. Historically, you guys typically see roughly half your revenues early on around R&D and then half as you start to ramp. Curious if that's how you see spending patterns there or might it be different?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, I think that \u2013 it's not as much R&D, first to start with that. A lot of these are established processes. So I think we're seeing it maybe more pilot and then when you're talking about the ramp-up, they're not quite the same profile as you would have in maybe a more established company. Most of these are ramping trailing edge or not leading technologies.","So a little bit smoother I think from that regard, but definitely front-end loading, the metrology capability just to be able to ramp the equipment. So for sure we're going to be one of the earlier ones to see it.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","And then, I guess, as they ramp, would you expect that ramp to be similar to what you see with non-domestic Chinese customers?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Probably a little stronger, simply because the scale of these fabs tends to be smaller. And I think from the standpoint of \u2013 on a relative basis, I think that you would see the concentration being higher. I mean, when our participation really slows is when you're talking some mega fabs that have got many, many years of experience. These fabs are newer and they're greenfield, so the ones we're dealing with right now. So I wouldn't expect it to fall-off the way it might have in a more traditional varied (24:34) giga fab.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","That's great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, as you think about calendar 2018, it looks like you're working from a backlog of seven months today. And other front-end guys, I presume including yourself have fairly good visibility into Q1. How are you thinking about the trajectory for revenues into 2018?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes, C.J., I mean, it's a little early. But you're right. I mean, given the backlog position we have and what we expect in terms of the order outlook over the next six months, we'll see where WFE is. I think we've got a view that a lot of the dynamics that are driving the industry today continue into next year.","Obviously, NAND flash will probably be a higher level of investment next year. China's probably bigger. DRAM is probably flat to a little bit lower. Foundry is probably on the margin a little weaker.","So, I think as we look at all of that, we see sort of this continuation of these trends. And so we're sizing the company and modeling similar levels of output. So I don't think it's \u2013 right now, I'm not seeing anything that leads me to believe that it's not flattish or a little bit better than that.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Very helpful. Thanks, Bren.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International","Okay. Yeah. Thanks very much. I also wanted to ask about WFE spending. Last fall, it seemed like the industry wasn't contemplating anything more than $35 billion WFE through \u2013 really through next year. And today, we are on track to see more than $40 billion in spending in 2017. So basically you've seen, over the course of nine months, an incremental $5 billion-plus in WFE relative to what people were thinking back then. And I know that you, along with your peers, are positively biased for next year. But I guess my question is how do you get comfortable that the increase that we've seen so far over the last few quarters hasn't been borrowed from the future?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes, that's a great question. I think a good way to think about it is where it's coming from. One of the biggest changes in the profile is relative to what's happening in China overall. And that investment is not really against leading edge. And so that's less about coming from the future and more about \u2013 it may affect some other people's trailing edge once it comes up and be a revenue battle for some of our customers.","But it's kind of new capital. And we'd all heard about China's spending for many years. It just hadn't materialized. And now we're seeing a lot of those projects, so that's part one. The other part for us is the broad participation across the 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer of logic in the foundry space. And so that's a little bit different too, and just a bigger commitment to that node than we saw in the last cycle. But, of course, there's a cyclicality associated with these businesses. So I think there'll be ebbs and flows. For example, NAND probably softens in 2018 because of all the capacity that's coming on or at least stays flat.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International","And your backlog, I thought C.J. mentioned it was like seven months. Is that \u2013 I mean, is that pretty locked in? What portion of that is actually cancelable?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, I mean, normally our business runs \u2013 it's a little bit harder now, because the order strength over the last couple of quarters has been pretty significant. I mean, we've had two out of three quarters over a $1 billion. So we'll start to ship down on that. I mean, we generally run between five and six months.","I guess, any of the backlog \u2013 I mean, what customers do, they don't usually cancel. What they do is they push, right? That's usually the indication. You'll see them start to push orders out. And then at some point then they'll start to convert those to newer versions of the products they had as they get ready to receive those tools.","But if you look at what's loaded in the factory, I would characterize the environment as customers generally pulling to get the tools quickly. And so far, we feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing. And as we \u2013 we spend a lot of time looking at indicators and all the different things that are out there. And...","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International","Sure.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","...we feel pretty good about the underlying fundamentals of what we're seeing today. And a lot of what's going on in China is, I'm not sure it's really contributing to the global sort of supply-demand dynamics, at least at this time. And so that's future investment for the long run. And so, I don't think that, that necessarily worries us from an overheating perspective at least early on.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International","Okay. And if I could just sneak in one more, you talked \u2013 Rick talked about NAND and foundry logic. How does DRAM fit into the 2018 equation?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, as we were saying, I mean, DRAM has bounced back this year from 2016 when \u2013 the leader didn't invest a lot in 2016, so we've seen some investment. I think, you know, look \u2013 it looks like it's in undersupply. So I don't think DRAM is going to be up as we move into next year. Maybe it's flat, maybe it's down a little bit. I don't see it changing a lot, but hard to see how it's up a lot from where it's at right now, at least, just generally how we see it.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. I had a follow-up on China as well. Unless I heard you incorrectly, Rick, I think you talked about your Chinese business in calendar 2017 doubling year-over-year. I was wondering if that included some of the multinationals spending or was that a pure local number. And if you can talk a little bit about the preliminary outlook into 2018 for your China business, that'll be helpful.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. The doubling we're referring to is native Chinese investment. We also have the multinational, but we're talking about what's going on there. And in terms of 2018, if you think about some of the ordering we're seeing as for the first phase, what these customers will tell you is, there's a subsequent phase planned. So we think that China continues to be strong as we go forward into 2018. But whether or not \u2013 internally, we discount the numbers that we've heard in CapEx from China over the next five years, and it's still pretty strong. If you even discount them in half, based on what some of these players are saying they're going to do.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then as a follow-up, I had a question on your bare wafer inspection business. I appreciate it's not necessarily a big part of your business today, but if and when some of your customers decide to expand capacity, I think it could be a pretty nice business for you guys, given the gross margin profile. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing today from those customers and what their outlook is in the second and potentially the 2018? Thank you.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Sure. Yeah, no, it's actually \u2013 it is an important business for us. It's a strong business. And not only that, what we're seeing is, demand both from wafer manufacturers, but also from customers \u2013 IC customers who are qualifying tools for ramps. It is an important part of the business. It is part of the uptick, and we're seeing in orders and it will come in revenue, as we go through. So it has been strong, and that's both for defect and also for flatness. So it's an important part of our story going forward.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much. Rick, the last time you saw this kind of really surge in sustained business was when the 28-nanometer node rolled out. Maybe a two-part question there. Do you believe, based on your customer conversations, that the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer node will be as large as 28-nanometer?","And secondly, can you \u2013 given the strength that you've seen in the last few quarters, what is the capital intensity change or increase from 28-nanometer to the 10-nanometer\/7-nanometer?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. Great question. I think that first part of that answer is there certainly is a lot of broad investment for the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. What's interesting about it, though, if you unpack a lot of our orders, the strength in our orders is really not as much from 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, as it is what we're seeing in memory, and some of the other segments that we're in. So it is strong but we haven't actually seen the same kind of surge we saw in 28-nanometer as we're seeing and 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. That said, it's pretty broad right now. And we think they're at least three, maybe four players that are going to be involved in that that we'll see going forward.","We are hearing from customers they think the size is going to be similar. But it's still early for 7-nanometer. And right now, what we're seeing is pretty intense investment around the 10-nanometer node.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my second question, in terms of the services business, where we've also seen the revenue ramp over the last few quarters, given the process control isn't like a process tool like edge, that basically eats itself up, what type of offerings or what type of solutions are you offering customers in the services end that will help grow that business to that 7% to 9% growth rate you talked about?","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, Patrick, it's Bren. It is a different business than our process tool peers. And so what you typically have is \u2013 so 75% of that revenue stream is contract, right? So we have customers that buy service contracts with different levels of coverage across either certain tools or broadly across a fab. And so most of that revenue is repeatable, and it allows us to test and right-size those fabs to maintain good utilization, but also to get pretty good predictably about part failure and so on.","But what we end up selling is, we replace parts, right? And so, then there's parts and as those parts fail over time, and you have lasers that have lives, useful lives and so on, so that's really the biggest part of the business. But it isn't traditional break and fix and that \u2013 it's billable. It's really contract. So it really works for us and works for customers, because we can keep the tools up and keep them optimized and run preventative maintenances, and those kinds of checks on them over time to keep them running, and it works out on both ends.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","One of the other things is the decay rate. You think about service contracts on tools and how long you service them, part of what's happened is people are keeping them in production longer. So if you think about fully utilized, older generation fabs that for many of our customers are just printing money, because they're fully depreciated. The tool life is longer than we expected, which means the decay rate on the back end is slower, which is part of the contributor to the growth, because you have stuff coming in and you don't have us much stuff coming out, and that's really the benefits we're seeing from IoT.","Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, first question, I want to try and get an update in terms of your view about Gen 5. We talked about it before. And I think right now you talked about mostly it still being used on rebuild. How do you kind of think about that go into production? Will we still have to wait until 5-nanometer or is EUV (36:35) the big kicker for that? If you can give some color around that.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, the good news is, we're kind of doing what we wanted to do with Gen 5 in terms of we are having broad shipments across a number of customers. And we're \u2013 basically on a one a month shipment rate. And so we continue to do that. I think the time when we would ramp that up is when we'd see it going into larger scale production. So there are some customers that are talking about production for it, but it's a limited number of layers. And when that happens, then we'll see multiple tools.","But right now, we're seeding the market. We're penetrating the market. It's a tricky supply chain situation, so we're keeping it at one a month right now, as we go forward and we'll ramp up. It's hard to say. Preliminary results are good. There is a lot of use cases for customers. But we stick to what we said before, where we think it really is a tool that ramps into production out a couple of years, high volume really when EUV is kicking in, so you'd say, 2019, 2020.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Actually, that's helpful color. And then, on the server side, I have a question actually. So, one of your peers or some of the company in the supply chain, right, they would charge customer or they'll write a contract with a customer where they do almost a yield base or performance-based contract with the customer. For example, I think Sima (38:01) used to do that. So I'm just curious, is that something that you guys entertain? Or is within the 75% of your services in same contract, are you guys starting to look at doing that in your service contract? Or is it still mostly fixed type of contract?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","So, we have a lot of key metrics that we agree to with customers, largely around availability of the tools and response time in service. And so we've historically done that. And, of course, as these tools become more mission-critical for our customers, that's part of the arrangement that we have. So when it comes to extending the life and working very hard to make sure we don't disrupt production, we already do that. That is part of the benefit that customers have from going contract.","There are things we're doing to enhance the business, we talked about in the last question. And some of them have to do with older fabs, where we continue to offer enhancements to the tools. A lot of tools have been in market for a long time, have upgrades available for customers, and we'll continue to offer those as we go forward. So I'd say we already have that as part of the offering.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick. First, historically, September quarter has been a weak one for you guys, but you have a very strong guidance. So the question is, are there any greenfields that are driving that? And as a part of the question is that, can you provide some color on how many greenfields you have for this year, and are there any thoughts on for next year? And then I have a follow-up.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yes, Jagadish, it is a little atypical to see the strength in September compared to the last few years. So we're encouraged by that. I don't have the actual number in front of me. I think we'll be shipping a fair amount \u2013 the second half has a fair amount of memory mix of shipments. There is obviously some additional 10-nanometer investment on the foundry that's shipping as well. So most of the China stuff, which is greenfield, is not shipping for a little while.","So, I guess, that's how I'd characterize the shipment profile next quarter. But as I said in the prepared remarks, strong and stable. And we see a second half shipment profile that's up a little bit versus the first half, so evenly weighted across the year. It's probably more memory centric in the second half of the year versus what we saw in the first half.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah, one other interesting attribute of our business environment \u2013 we looked at this recently \u2013 the concentration from the top customers is actually down. We actually have broader customers. When we look at the top 10, the percent they make up of the business has decreased in this calendar year. It was slightly down last year and we anticipate that broadening. So the good news is, I think we have more customers in more locations and more offerings for them.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Okay. Excellent. And just as a follow-up, you talked about, Rick, in your prepared remarks about new products and particularly for the memory segment. Hypothetically, if we assume that WFE is up, say, 5% for next year, would it be fair to say that you could outperform WFE, as these new products start to bear fruit? Thank you.","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Actually, I'll let Bren take that one.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Yeah. I mean one thing about next year is, it looks like next year's WFE mix is a little more memory-centric. And as you know, the process control intensity in memory, while it is getting better, isn't near foundry. So $1 billion of WFE depending on the segment is not created equal for us.","But we've seen some improvement on the memory said, which we're encouraged by. I think these new products, given the timing of when they'll ship and go to market, and we'll actually start to see revenue given the valuation process and so on, I think in the second half of the year, we might see some revenue, but I think it will be a pretty small amount. But as I look at our plans for next year, I look at the funnel, I don't see any reason why KLA shouldn't grow in line with \u2013 at least in line with the market, as we move into 2018.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC","Congrats on a solid execution.","Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open.","Atif Malik - Citigroup","Thanks for taking my question. And, Rick, good job in kind of refocusing KLA on memory in China after the merger breakup. My question is on 3D NAND yields. Can you help us understand where the 3D NAND yields are on Gen 1 NAND, that 48-layer, just kind of blended across \u2013 for guide, and where the yields are on the second generation, 64-layer NAND? And is there a reason to believe that there's something structural about migration from 48-layer to 64-layer to 96-layer which will keep the yields kind of low for a sustainable period of time?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","Well, as you know, one of the biggest challenges is one of the ones we're trying to address, which is the ability to catch defects in the process. So as a result, when customers have process problems, they have to go through some pretty rigorous engineering analysis to unpack those problems. So you see two things. One, you see actual wafer yield as sometimes probably \u2013 it is averaging lower than what you would see on 2D. And it's probably depends on customers, somewhat, how that is, but it is lower. But it's still pretty good. And you see that because they're having success selling them commercially.","But the other thing is, you see line yield bus, (43:55) which is a little different, which is when you have a number of wafers that are actually bad, and have to be scrapped, and for many customers, that's very disruptive to their business. So I'd say that, yes, structurally, it's very hard to build these \u2013 especially as you're going up in layers, the devices, for two reasons. One, the process technology is very tricky. And the second one, you don't have a lot of visibility into it.","And it's kind of like the old days of semiconductor manufacturing, when we didn't have as much in line, and people had to use disruptive means or short loops to try to figure out what was wrong with their process. So there is opportunity. I think we've repeatedly said that, if we could help with solutions that help customers gain a few points of yield, that's easily justifiable on their end. But I would say, yields are in the range of probably, if you'd see them over 90% in 2D, you'd see similar yields at, say, 10 points lower, say 80% or so for \u2013 and maybe they are even higher than 90% in 2D, so you'd see a degradation as you go to the 3D.","Atif Malik - Citigroup","Very helpful. As a follow-up, the bifurcation in leading edge foundry versus lagging edge is expanding. UMC cut its CapEx and decided to actually focus on the lagging edge. So when you're talking to the Chinese domestic foundry customers, are they asking for 28-nanometer equipment or they're asking for the latest 10-nanometer, 40-nanometer equipment?","Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.","It varies. I mean, they definitely have ambitions to advance nodes down the road. So you do see some interest in the advanced and you'll see customers doing, in that case, in the foundries, some R&D, or at least some of them doing some. But by and large, it's the older tool sets because they do have capital costs to manage and they've got to try to hit the cost per wafer targets that everybody else has. But you do see some interest in the advanced. And they also want to have a path and a road map. The good news relative to our equipment is have upgrades available on things like our Gen 4 wafer inspection, as an example, where we can continue to add value to a tool set that they buy.","Atif Malik - Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions]","Ed Lockwood, KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ted Lockwood","Thank you, Liane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3000 to request a copy.

In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Bren will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials.","KLA-Tencor's fourth quarter results culminate a year of strong operating and financial performance for the company, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives. Our June quarter report is highlighted by achievement of the second highest net bookings result of the company's history in fiscal 2014, including record bookings for our wafer inspection products in the year. This demonstrates our customer focus and market leadership, as well as the critical role KLA-Tencor plays in helping our customers address the higher cost and complexity associated with competing at the leading edge.","Additionally, we announced earlier this month, our Board of Directors has authorized significant increases to the company's program to return cash to stockholders. These enhancements include an 11% increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, as well as an increase of 13 million additional shares to the company share repurchase authorization, which brings the value of the shares remaining available for repurchase under our program to approximately $1 billion using our current stock price. This meaningful increase and the targeted amount of cash being returned to stockholders is reflected -- reflective of our more assertive capital deployment strategy.","Now for some perspective on the current demand environment. New orders for June were $898 million, 24% above the midpoint of guidance with strong foundry bookings for the sub-20 nanometer and upside to DRAM forecast leading the way. In foundry, we're encouraged by the strength of the upside in the June quarter, with foundry orders nearly doubling compared to the March quarter. We believe the magnitude of these orders reflect our market leadership and the critical nature of process control in enabling the adoption of 3D technologies. However, as we indicated at SEMICON West, the upside in the foundry orders in Q4 was concentrated with a single customer. Delivery of these orders are not slotted to begin until later this year, and they are expected to extend into calendar 2015. The timing of those shipments combined with the uncertainty of our plans for sub-20 nanometer capacity additions among the other major foundries for the remainder of calendar 2014 continues to put pressure on the outlook for foundry spending in the year. However, we believe this also sets up a strong year for foundry in 2015 as we expect to see broader customer participation and a steady focus on ramping 16- and 14-nanometer technologies.","Logic orders came in largely as expected in the June quarter. Memory orders also grew sequentially in the June quarter, driven by strength in DRAM with customers continuing their investment in 2X nanometer technology conversions. In NAND flash, order's levels continue to be modest and focused on planar NAND.","For KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition.","Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million with about 70% of systems orders concentrated among foundry and logic customers in the quarter. Guidance for revenue in the September quarter is in the range of $590 million to $650 million with non-GAAP earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.54 in the quarter. Our September quarter revenue and EPS guidance reflect a longer shipment lead time associated with the recent quarter flow.","With our current backlog, coupled with the anticipated order profile for the second half of the year, we expect shipment and revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his review of the numbers.","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q4 and my perspective on current trends in the marketplace and our outlook for the second half of calendar year 2014.","Revenue for Q4 was $734 million, just above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.77. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter below the midpoint of the guided range at $0.80 per share.","In our press release and our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments covered in today's press release.","New orders in Q4 were $898 million, significantly above the guided bookings range for the quarter of $625 million to $825 million as we saw upside in our original order forecast from one of our foundry customers and from DRAM. We are encouraged by the strong demand in the June quarter as we believe it speaks to the value of process control in helping our customers navigate the complex transition from planar to 3D structures. Also, as Rick mentioned, since these orders are largely scheduled to ship in revenue in calendar '15, we think this very strong order activity sets the stage for 2015 to be another year of strong relative growth for process control and what industry analysts expect to be a growth year for the semiconductor equipment industry. We expect to have multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading edge capacity featuring 3D designs in foundry, logic and memory in 2015.","Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the June quarter. Foundry demand was 68% of new orders for Q4, consistent with our expectations as a percentage of the overall mix of orders but higher in dollar terms compared with March. Foundry orders in Q4 featured nearly $300 million in system orders from one customer to largely support 14-nanometer activities. These orders are scheduled to begin shipping later in the current calendar year and revenue in calendar year '15. I would note that these orders are not a pull-in and represent significant upside to original forecast for this customer.","Clearly, the competitive battleground for 3D foundry is taking shape, and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be strong, broad-based foundry demand at the 16- and 14-nanometer nodes.","Memory was 23% of new system orders in June, up sequentially both in terms of percent of total orders and absolute dollars compared with March. Memory demand in the June quarter was highlighted by another good quarter for DRAM. Notably, we delivered upside to our original memory forecast for June even with orders from Korea finishing significantly below the quarterly levels we've seen over the past few years. We think this indicates good breadth of demand among the market leaders in leading edge memory and also points to the quarterly variability of individual customer demand in our highly concentrated end market.","Logic was 9% of new orders in June, down slightly compared with the original forecast. Customer investments in technology at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 75% of the orders we received in the June quarter.","Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group. Wafer inspection was approximately 55%. As Rick mentioned, total orders for our wafer inspection products were a record in fiscal '14, finishing in excess of $1.5 billion for the year. Reticle inspection was approximately 10%; metrology was approximately 14%; service was 19%; storage, High Brightness LED and other nonsemi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q4 were $694 million and below the guided range as delivery timing for certain orders related to leading edge foundry and NAND projects originally scheduled to ship in the June quarter shifted into the second half of 2014. This is consistent with the conditions we experienced in our March quarter.","In general, our shipment profile associated with our recent bookings features extended lead times and is resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near term. Looking forward, given our June orders and our September bookings forecast, we are currently modeling December quarter shipments above $800 million with sequential quarterly growth in shipments expected to continue through the remainder of fiscal '15. September quarterly shipments are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $660 million.","In total, we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of: $977 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months; and $269 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed up by customers.","Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $734 million, down 12% sequentially from the March quarter and just above the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $650 million in the September quarter, driven by a lower shipment's forecast resulting from the extended lead times in our current shipment backlog that I just discussed. Given our strong backlog, we expect revenue growth to resume in the December quarter.","Gross margin was 56%, down compared with the March quarter and 150 basis points lower than the midpoint of the guidance range we've provided due to a less favorable mix of products that revenue-ed in the quarter and higher-than-expected costs in our service business. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 54% to 55% in September, largely a function of the lower revenue forecast for the quarter.","Total operating expenses were $231 million, up about $5 million sequentially over the March quarter and just above our guidance range of $225 million to $230 million, mainly due to material and personnel costs associated with next-generation product development programs. Going forward, we expect quarterly operating expenses in the $230 million to $235 million range, reflecting higher product development costs associated with our ongoing investments in next-generation technologies to meet customer requirements and extend our market leadership.","Our effective tax rate was 23% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate. For modeling purposes going forward, we believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be reduced to 22% given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013 will be reinstated at some point during the next 12 months. Finally, net income for the June quarter was $133 million or $0.80 per fully diluted share.","I'll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.15 billion, an increase of $126 million compared with March. Cash from operations was $249 million in the quarter, up $11 million sequentially over the March quarter, and free cash flow was $236 million.","In the quarter, we paid $74 million in dividends and repurchased $60 million of our common stock at an average price of $66.19. As Rick mentioned, our Board of Directors recently increased the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, and also authorized us to repurchase an additional 13 million shares of our common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately 2 million shares available for repurchase under our existing authorization, so the board's recent increase brings the value of the shares remaining available for repurchase under our program to approximately $1 billion using our current stock price. We currently plan to execute this repurchase program over the next 12 to 18 months. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over $167 million.","We are pleased with the strong bookings result for the June quarter as we believe it speaks to our market leadership and the critical nature of process control and helping our customers address the increasing cost and complexity associated with the transition from planar to 3D device architectures. However, the extended lead time associated with these orders is having an impact on shipments in the near term and resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and EPS guidance for the September quarter. We see this as a temporary anomaly with shipment and revenue growth forecasted to resume in the December quarter and setting the stage for what we expect to be a strong growth year for KLA-Tencor in calendar year 2015.","With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the September quarter is: bookings are expected to be within the range of $600 million to $800 million; revenue, between $590 million and $650 million; and earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.54 per share.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ted Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Feel free to requeue for your follow-up questions, and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits.","So Liane, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group.","Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question, considering the extended lead times that you're seeing, particularly on the foundry side, I'm wondering if that extends also into other customers into 2015. What I'm trying to get at is how do you see the ramp in terms of '16, '14 spend and, therefore, the linearity to shipments the foundry gets for you guys into the next year?","Bren Higgins","C.J., good question. Thanks, it's Bren. So I think as we look out going forward here, I think that clearly, this -- and I talked about it at SEMICON West where we had effectively one customer that we're expecting to ship somewhere close to $100 million to -- in the September quarter and we plan to book those orders in June. That business fell out; other businesses came in to replace it. And so it did put a bit of a hole into the shipment forecast for the quarter. I think going forward, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see the shipment trajectory of being positive, and we'll see a resumption of growth into December. And as we said in the remarks, it looks like it's greater than $800 million or so. I think it's interesting. It is fairly fluid in terms of timing or it has been, although, I think that those -- these orders that we did see in the quarter in foundry are a, I think, a good confidence point in terms of timing and when we expect that capacity to get added as we go into the first part of 2015. So we'll see. I mean, there has been a fair amount of fluidity around the shipment plan over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, this one in particular, it was a large sizable order, and those orders are slotted in -- mostly in the first half of the year.","Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess as a quick follow-up, in terms of roughly the $1 billion buyback, is that something that if you were to see weakness, you would look to be more aggressive or is that something you're still planning over the next 12 months?","Bren Higgins","Well, our plan is, as we put in the press release, was that we were going to execute that over the next 12 to 18 months. Obviously, there are conditions you would look at as you go through that period in terms of -- that would impact how you think about the timing. But that's as far as I want to go in terms of how we would execute that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So given the order upside in the June quarter, I believe at SEMICON you said you sort of now anticipate a flattish second half versus first half, so sort of 2 questions on that front. Given your pipeline, do you still expect flattish second-half orders? And then your first half order mix was roughly 63% foundry, 23% memory, 14% logic. How do you see that mix in the second half? And can you point to specific programs or initiatives sort of dragging that order mix?","Bren Higgins","So, this is Bren. Harlan, I think that -- in consistent with what we've said at SEMICON, and we see the second half lining up roughly flat with the first half given the strength of June where we thought -- initially, we thought second half would be stronger but then we had the strength in June, which drove that view where I think it's sort of flattish now. So I don't think that that's changed. As I look at the data, I think that foundry is probably up half-on-half, memory's up half-on-half, and logic is probably lower.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then gross margin performance, Bren, as you highlighted for the June quarter, came in roughly about 110 basis points below the low end of your guidance range. I know you mentioned mix and lower revenues. Is the mix impact due to lower shipments of your high-end tools? Maybe you can just provide a bit more color there. And then for the gross margin guide for September, is that weighted more towards mix effects or just lower absorption from lower revenues?","Bren Higgins","Yes, so on the Q4 performance relative to guide, I mean, systems mix was about 1\/2 of the delta there. And it was really just driven by what ends up revenue in the quarter, and that is all driven by acceptance cycles and so on. So that is how we just finished up, and it was weaker than I had expected. I think in terms of which product lines, I think there's a lot of -- always a fair amount of movement in that in terms of what actually gets accepted. The other piece of -- the other half of the margin weakness was driven by just higher-than-expected costs, parts costs in our service business, and I think it's just related to the mix of service business that we had in the quarter. So if you think about Q1, I think Q1, most of it to your point, I think, is you -- when you think about the revenue decline, I mean, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to have output going forward in excess of $800 million. So you're taking your costs associated with the ability to deliver that kind of output and spreading those across a lower revenue base, and certainly, that dilutes margin. I think the other dynamic that's in there is service is up just a little bit quarter-on-quarter. So service, which we believe is dilutive to gross margin -- it's accretive to operating margin but dilutive to gross margin as a greater percentage of the revenue mix, and that has an impact as well. So those are the dynamics that are affecting Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Farhan, asking a question on behalf of John. I just wanted to probe you a little bit more in terms of the FinFET ramp. How it is progressing? The order backlog that you have already from one customer as you mentioned and what you're seeing from the other customers, where do you think the expected capacity is by end of this year and how do you see that progressing through the next year?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. This is Rick. We continue to see a lot of customer interest in FinFET development, but I think that when you get to large-scale production, we're really looking out in the foundry space in particular to see what happens in 2015. We're not as dialed in to some of the other suppliers in terms of the actual number of wafer starts. There are a lot of estimates out there. But we do see activity across several foundries in terms of FinFET. The expectation there'll be pilot -- continue to be pilot work this year and then ramping into production and high volume by the end of calendar '15.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then my second question is on gross margins, the gross margin guidance for September quarter. If I think about the gross margins, your gross margins at that level were only way back in 2009. So I just wanted to understand like going forward after the September quarter, how should we think about gross margin? Is there some sort of a decline that has happened going forward or is it just a onetime issue?","Bren Higgins","Well, I think as I mentioned, I think how we're sized relative to the revenue levels is a factor certainly in that -- in September. I think going forward, over the long run, you always have some volatility in terms of the mix of products that we end up revenue-ing, and that has some impact on gross margin. I don't see anything fundamentally different or structural in the overall business in terms of gross margin performance. And I think you ought to continue to see us, over broad periods of time, perform fairly consistently with the gross margin model that we cited many times at 60% to 70% incremental gross margin on revenue growth. So I think given where we're starting from here, I think if mix holds the way I think it is today and obviously, that moves around a little bit, I think we'd probably end up performing towards the higher end of that range early on. But we'll have to see how it plays out. But nothing, as I said, that's sort of structural that, over broader periods of time, that would indicate that there's anything different than what we've seen in the past.","Richard P. Wallace","And this is Rick. To that point, if you look at the order book for the June quarter and you would analyze the expected margin, once those tools revenue-ed, then it's very consistent with what we've seen historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rick, can you talk about the timing of the next phase for 3D NAND orders? If [indiscernible] on their call, they talked about the economics of 2D being better than 3D in the second half. Can you talk about what are your expectations in terms of the timing for the 3D second phase orders?","Richard P. Wallace","I think that's -- sure. I think the soonest we would see the next tranche of orders for additional capacity for 3D, the soonest would be the end of the calendar year with anticipation of early calendar '15 ramp-up. So I don't expect anything to happen before then. I think there's a lot of questions out there continuing to be addressed by our customers but when we talk to them that's the kind of timeframe we see is orders if they happen this calendar year would be at the end of the calendar year supporting buildout in '15, and I think you get to multiple suppliers -- the soonest you get to multiple suppliers is by the end of '15.","Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about the action or the steps you're taking to combat ASML offering an on-board metrology and lithography, too, that can you talk about your historical relationship with Nikon and what you're planning to do in the future?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we don't -- I guess, certainly from our customers, there's an interest as EUV pushes out to get more capability to be able to support the multi-patterning challenges with overlay. But -- and it's not just overlay, it's all the patterning challenges. So we have been pulled, I would say, by customers to support an initiative but what we're -- we talked about is 5D, which handles several discipline aspects of the patterning challenges. And that includes allowing our customers to interface with multiple suppliers of lithography but also looking at feedforward and feedback for match as well. So we're engaged with several customers on that, trying to support their efforts to get control of the -- of their litho strategy. And I think that, that includes support with other suppliers and I think of litho in particular. And so we're working those avenues. But there's a very active engagement by customers as they deal with the challenges on multi-patterning.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rick, I just wanted to follow up on the big $300 million order that you got from that foundry in the June quarter. Do you think the product mix from that customer will be favorable to your fiscal 2015 gross margin?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I mentioned in a response to an earlier question that if you look at the order book -- I'll be more general than specific to that one quarter, but if you take June and you look at the overall orders for June, the gross margin from that quarter looks more typical of what you would expect and what we've historically had. So rather than getting into specific margin per customers, I'll just say, overall, June looks more typical of what we've done in the past. And as Bren said, there's some anomalies in the June quarter and September that are impacting overall margins, but it does resume as he indicated back to our historical levels as you get out further into '15.","Bren Higgins","I think the other thing I would just add to that is if you look at the mix of the new products and a lot of the products that we talked about at SEMICON West with some product launches, the margin profile of the new products is on par or better than what we've seen in the past. So we feel very comfortable, I think, with the margin position of the latest products that are part of that order book but also, just in general, what we're shipping out of the factories today.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the December quarter shipments, getting back to the $800 million level. Do you think there will be DRAM shipments or capacity adds helping in that December quarter also?","Bren Higgins","We're still in excess of $800 million into December. And I think a lot of that -- I mean, there's capacity that's being shipped, I think, in general in the book for memory. But I think a lot of that depends on timing of orders. But it's certainly possible we could see some capacity shipping in the December quarter for DRAM.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just have a couple of things. First, Bren, I don't know if you're going to answer this. But given how much the numbers are whipping around, you gave us shipments for December. I'm wondering if you can give us some sense of revenue for December and maybe margins, just given how margins are also whipping around because of some of the absorption around this big order? And then I have a follow-up.","Bren Higgins","Tim, I don't want to guide out to the December quarter. I wanted to, I think, provide a little bit of color on how September is sort of setting up and some of the unique dynamics that are affecting September on the negative side and our expectations going forward. Certainly, there's a -- a portion of our revenue is going to come from shipments. So to the extent that we can deliver the shipments, 40% to 50% typically of shipments end up being revenue to the quarter. So that obviously has an impact on where we end up. But to your point, I mean, it's clearly -- in the short term, there's a little bit more volatility around the numbers. I think over the long term, given a lot of the dynamics that we talked about at SEMICON West, I think it's -- perhaps there's some moderating cyclicality, but in the short term, there can be volatility. When you have just a few customers placing orders and they're large orders and the ASPs are high, units are lower, it does have an impact. Those dynamics do have an impact quarter-on-quarter when one customer makes a decision on their plans. And I think one aspect to these plans, in terms of how people buy process control, is they tend to front-load it. And so to the extent there are challenges around progressing nodes and they're -- it obviously impacts the timing of how they add process control. And they get in the Q I think a little bit earlier for that. And as a result to that, you do see some movement when there are challenges in terms of trying to ramp new capacity. So I think those are dynamics that we're just going to have to live with. I think there are a lot of positives to it in terms of just our exposure to foundry logic. But over the long run, I think it has very little effect. And as I said, I think over time, I think it makes things a little bit more predictable in terms of how we look at it.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then I guess, just a big-picture question for Rick. Rick, I've been covering KLA for like 16 years and KLA never used to miss on any number. They never used to miss guidance, very predictable results, operate with a lot of backlog. And now every quarter it seems like we're guiding below or margins are whipping around a lot, yet you still have about the same amount of backlog that you've always had. So I was just wondering if you can sort of wax poetic a little bit about maybe what's different about the company today because it seems like it's becoming a lot less predictable and a lot less operating with a lot of backlog as it used to, and I'm just not sure why?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, great question. I think -- 2 thoughts, and I'll let Bren weigh in on part of this answer. It's interesting if you look back in the last 4 or 5 years. The predictability year-on-year has actually never been higher. Our ability, when we go back and look at our plans for our calendar year, our internal plans, fiscal year-on-year, it's actually pretty close to what happened. The volatility has dramatically increased on a quarter-by-quarter basis, however. And I think it speaks a little bit to what's going on in terms of fewer customers, fewer units, larger ASPs. And the backlog is partly affected by our customers not needing to take things early or not wanting to take things early but not wanting to have them late. So they want all the equipment to come in at the same time kind of to Bren's comment earlier, when they're looking at a ramp, they want to front-load it with process control. But when something moves out as it did in the September quarter, the guys that want to move in, did -- it's not a plug-and-play in terms of being able to fill in that revenue. So I think the backlog is still very solid, it's just not as fungible in terms of short term as it was. Bren, if you want to add anything to that.","Bren Higgins","So Tim, I think over the last 3 or 4 years, we've seen shipment backlog actually come in a fair amount. It used to be consistently around 6 months. And over the last few years, it's come down between 4 and 5. There is a bit of a pop in June but it's related to some long lead-time business that we booked. I think that's a little bit of an anomaly compared to what we've seen where we're generally booking in one quarter and shipping a fair amount in the next quarter. So that has changed a fair amount. And to Rick's point, it's not necessarily fungible customer-by-customer, and the timing is a factor in terms of when they need the equipment. So as a result of that, we are reacting I think much faster to the bookings number or really the shipment number, I think, in terms of where the P&L is. And so to the extent that there's predictability quarter-on-quarter in shipments, then that enables us, I think, to drive a little bit more predictability in the P&L. But it does react much faster, and in the past, we had more backlog to, I guess, absorb or cushion some of those swings, one direction or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I actually wanted to follow up, Rick, on the comment you made about the timing of the customers trying to take all the tools together. The thing -- it's -- what's surprising is, I would think that to your tools, [ph] goes with the lithography tool and if I look at your guidance ASML, they guided the shipment down 20% almost in Q3 and then another down 15% in Q4, whereas you are seeing a pick-up in Q4. So where does that discrepancy coming from? I would think that foundry guys will be looking for lithography tools first, or at least lithography and process control together.","Richard P. Wallace","Well, you might imagine, we don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's happening in the litho tools space as much as dealing with our own dynamics. But a couple of thoughts for you: One, in the case of technology transition. Essentially, the world is on 193, by and large, 193 scanners now. And so there's really not a lot of change in new technology for scanners with the pushout of EUV. So may well be, they -- there's some modest changes in the scanner but they're not moving wavelengths. So they -- you don't really have necessarily technology by as much as you do and -- with some of our tools with new tools coming in. And also, if you look at memory, then in the memory case, again, the extension of litho. So we have some of the overall, probably same dynamics but I don't think it's necessarily as linked as it might have been in the past when the new litho technology isn't really that new. What we do see, too, is in the case of the order we received that we've talked about in June is the timing for that, part of the customer's goal, and we were working with them, was to secure the slots to support a RAM but also to get us in place to provide the training and resources to do all those things. In that case, they have the lithography that they need. What they were talking about is bringing in the other tool set and particularly ours because they're feeling very pressured by the yield challenges as they do 20 and sub-20 nanometers given their portfolio. So on that one, I think there's a clear difference between what we would experience in other tool providers. So I don't think it's always true that it's the same -- we're not dealing with many greenfield fabs these days. Mostly, what we're talking about is the extensions to existing capacity. In the case of greenfield, then, of course, you'd be right. You'd want to get litho tools and the other new ones, but that's not a big part of what's going on right now.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's actually very helpful. And I conclude from that, that the tools you are shipping are more newer version of your tools rather than the repeat buyers kind of thing for that 300-millimeter big orders.","Richard P. Wallace","Correct. New -- new in that customer. Not necessarily new everywhere, but new for that customer.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And then one quickly on the OpEx. With the revenues going down so much, won't OpEx should be going down because your bonus allocation probably should be going down for the quarter?","Bren Higgins","Well, when we look at OpEx, I mean, the way we think about sizing the business is relative to the roadmap requirements to maintain the product investments that we need to make. And so we're less sensitive, obviously, to a quarterly change in that. And I think given our expectations of the ramp in business, we think given the -- what we feel like we need to do and our expectations of our fiscal year, but also as we look at into calendar '15, we think that's sized right. I think over time, depending on performance, you start to see variable comp move both directions. But it doesn't do that necessarily in one quarter. It all depends on what happens on sort of annual views in terms of how we pay that out. So for now, I think it's reflecting, I think, the -- some higher program investments and I expect to see those going through over the fiscal year, and I'm currently sizing the business right now around -- on an annual basis, somewhere between $925 million and $935 million for a fiscal year, and that translates into the guidance range that we gave you. Business is a lot stronger. That probably doesn't change all that much. Probably a little bit related to comp. If the business is weaker on the margin, probably doesn't change much the other direction. I think significant moves either way, obviously, will have us reacting to it, but that's how we're looking at it today.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, let me just add to that. We are starting a new fiscal year, so September is the first quarter. Obviously, we're well aware of the plans for September as we make our plan for the fiscal year. And we feel very confident about our plan for the fiscal year. And we think we'll have a very strong FY '15 for KLA-Tencor. And we're obviously aware of what that means in terms of the -- starting with the September quarter. So I think we're actually well positioned to outgrow the industry as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just want to go back to the cash balance and buyback that I think C.J. touched on. Bren, when you made the buyback announcement at SEMICON West, I think some people were expecting more just given that if you were to execute that over 12 to 18 months, it would seem like you could cover most of it with your strong cash flow generation, and therefore, barely make a dent in the cash balance. So could we get your perspective on that and just the capital structure more broadly?","Bren Higgins","Well, certainly. As I talked about at SEMICON West, I think for a lot of the reasons that I talked about around secular dynamics, our business model, our ability to generate cash through cycle, that there's an opportunity, I think, for the company to be -- to adopt a more service capital structure as part of our long-term strategy. And so I think we've done a lot already with what we've done in terms of our dividend and the growth rate in the dividend, but there's an aspect or an opportunity to do more there. So the buyback announcement was that the sort of the recognition of that, I think the logical first step in terms of moving in that direction. I don't want to show all my cards on it, but it is something that we continue to look at additional opportunities to drive value for our shareholders by using the capital structure of the company in a more assertive way. So -- also, I think, given a lot of the dynamics I talked about, it does offer an opportunity, I think, to rely more on leverage as an opportunity to fund the company's needs, either strategic or operational down the road. And so certainly, that's an aspect of how we're thinking about it as well. So we will -- I think, on execution of the buyback, it will take our U.S. cash balance. I think, reducing the U.S. cash reserves, which is how we're going to fund that with the logical first step there, and then they'll take our U.S. cash balance because I'm not generating any new cash in the U.S. because I'm already paying it all out. We'll take it down to somewhere around $1 billion, which we think is at the right level given our views of just a strategic -- the ability to fund strategic needs and operational requirements.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Would you consider raising your debt levels to bring your net cash down to a level below $2 billion?","Bren Higgins","Well, I don't want to get in the specifics. I think to your point and the point I made, I think there are opportunities to -- and I think this has changed a lot in the last 12 months and I think as we look at it today, I think there are opportunities to use more leverage to drive more value over time. And I'll leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of them. Rick, I have a question. Your 2 foundry customers that are doing 14-nanometer FinFET and they have a technology tie-up. Are the DTOR[ph] or PTOR[ph] tools the same between the 2 or can they make independent decisions?","Richard P. Wallace","I'm trying to think about the confidentiality of that question. I think that, in general, our customers, the ones we deal with, are unique and able to make their own decisions.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. All right. And then just a 2-part question for Bren. On the December quarter shipments over $800 million, can you talk a little bit about what it is in the composition of the review between foundry and memory and other guys? And also did you give the June quarter order breakdown by geography?","Bren Higgins","I think the breakdown of the geography is on the web, in our supplemental information. So you can get it there. And it's -- we talked about it at SEMICON West, so it's probably not at all different from there as we finalized the quarter. I don't want to get into the mix of the shipments. We don't typically look at it that way and it all lines up based on when customer request dates are and that's how we end up driving the shipments. So I -- we think a lot about order -- incoming orders from a customer segment perspective. But to our operational guys, it's all about shipping the tool, not necessarily where it's going.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Did you guys give a breakdown of DRAM versus NAND in June?","Bren Higgins","DRAM in June, of the memory number, which was 23%; NAND flash was 29% of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury from Summit Research.","Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC","This is Srini Sundararajan. I have 2 questions: one positive and one negative. The first question is when you look at calendar Q3, would you see that there's a breadth of foundry orders like how you're getting foundry orders from like the 28-nanometer customers right down to 16 nanometers?","Bren Higgins","Yes, there is some breadth in the order book for foundry in September. We look generally, across the second half but in September also.","Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And considering that your big order that -- for like the shipments have been likely to be later, isn't it fundamentally different than whether Apple and Qualcomm go with the one set of foundries or the other? And therefore, do you have some contingency plans on what might happen if there are cancellations?","Bren Higgins","Generally, I mean if you look historically, our orders tend to shift. I mean, our cancellations in our backlog tend to be very low. I mean less than 1%, over time. So it's usually very good backlog. And obviously, the timing moves around a little bit. So I don't have any reason to believe in this case that this isn't quality backlog that will ship over the next 6 to 12 months.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, we're heavily engaged with the management team and have had a lot of meetings about support. So I'm confident as well that there is -- to Bren's point, that these orders are very solid. I think one thing we have seen in the recent past as the customer has consolidated more, we do see, I think, we have pretty good visibility into people's confidence in their plans. And usually, they'll let us know if it's not going to happen. But once they place the orders, it's pretty good indication. The only exception would have been what happened during the 2009, right after the financial crisis, I'd say then, in those environments, all bets are off. But since then, I think it's been very solid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Rick, when you were talking about outgrowing the industry back at SEMICON, outgrowing by 5%. Is that revenue-based or shipment?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we generally look over our timeframes in terms of -- ultimately, it has to be revenue. So it varies. But as you know, Mehdi, depending on the start and endpoint, you got to integrate it over time. But ultimately, if it didn't turn into revenue, it doesn't really count, right?","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Because early on, you said the year or fiscal year is very lumpy, which I understand, customer concentration. But the year has progressed in line with what you were expecting in January. But when I look at your shipment guide, even for December, even if I put in more than $800 million, it would give me calendar year shipment down 3%. So either you're saying or suggesting that WFE is going to decline by more than 5%? Or is that just an anomaly?","Richard P. Wallace","I'll let Bren take the year, but we're looking out at FY '15 press, whereas we're referring to as opposed to calendar '15, which is the next 4 quarters. But again, Bren can address calendar '14.","Bren Higgins","So when we think about calendar '14, I mean, we --- back in January, I think we were in a much more bullish view that we've moderated as we went into the April call, and I don't think that view has changed today. That we think the industry is probably plus 5% to plus 10% in that range. And so -- and when I -- and to Rick's point earlier, and just try to think about revenue performance relative to industry. This year, calendar '14, I think because of these pauses related to leading edge foundry, I think because of memory composition, I think we're setting up for this year to probably be somewhere around the market perform in calendar '14. I think as we look at calendar '15 and we -- to Rick's point earlier about our fiscal '15 given the dynamics expect about foundry and the progression of 16- and 14-nanometer ramp, we think that the company is positioned to see some of the relative outperformance that we saw in 2011, 2012 timeframe.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm just trying to understand the thought behind the forecasting because in January, you were saying that foundry is going to be weak, but then 3D NAND is going to be very strong. And back then, you were saying that June quarter, you should be able to do around $750 million, $800 million of shipment. That has entirely changed. And now you're saying there's a big turn coming in December. So I'm just wondering what gives the confidence that these turns or these pauses don't change or is -- are you -- are we setting ourselves up for more disappointment down the road?","Bren Higgins","Well, I mean -- and we talked about it a lot over the last 6 months about just, I think, the challenges our customers have been facing in trying to ramp some of these new technologies, in the memory side with V-NAND, I think there were expectations in the industry. It's certainly a much stronger investment in V-NAND and certainly, I think that has pushed out into '15. Certainly, the next phase of that. We talked about a lot about foundry push. I think, given what we're seeing in the order book now, it seems that we're starting to see these commitments in the industry towards putting production in place to start to ramp this capability for FinFET into the middle of next year. And that would line up with timing of shipments in the fourth quarter, calendar quarter and into the March quarter to be able to have that capability come on line. But these have been very challenging transitions for our customers and they've all, I think, crossed whether it's memory or even in foundry. We've seen a slowdown there that has continued through the middle of the year. It looks like it's going to be -- it's turning the corner now, but I think it's been a tough transition.","Richard P. Wallace","And Mehdi, to your point, and you've made this point in the past as I recall, our inability to forecast short term. It is -- I made the comment earlier on the call. It is interesting, when I look back, we actually have done -- certainly, internally when we plan out the year, we've actually done a pretty good job of forecasting on an annualized basis. But what is interesting also is it's usually not exactly how we thought it would happen. So if I look at the fiscal year that just ended, our booking's target for the year and what we ended up achieving internally is very close to what we have modeled and process control intensity was very close, and we actually had some strength in share. But when you go back and look at the specific customers in the mix, it wasn't necessarily at all what we thought. So it came from different regions, it came from different customers, it came from different -- sometimes even different products. So I would say, we're better over the longer term and more on an annualized basis than we are on a quarterly basis. And even to your point, things move and have moved quite a bit during this calendar year. And to your point, it's pretty likely that they'll move again based on this history. So we're -- we pointed out at SEMICON West, it's very hard for us to predict WFE, so we base our business on what we think in terms of share and adoption and how we can drive process control intensity and try to be flexible to handle the normal gyrations we see in the customer base. But we have consistently proven your point, we're not great at forecasting certainly over a 3-month period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Rick, maybe first, a big kind of picture question on the reticle inspection business as a whole. We've seen a pickup in orders in recent quarters. But do you see any big structural changes in that business itself given that you are at much higher run rates coming out of the market correction in 2010 and '11 but we've kind of seen it really muted for the last, I would say, 3 years. Are there big changes coming around? Or do you see maybe a more sustained pickup as we enter 2015?","Richard P. Wallace","Patrick, great question. I would say the following: One, the biggest inflection that would come for reticle inspection would, of course, be EUV and high volume. And we said at SEMICON West and continue to say, we don't see that happening in the foreseeable future. However, we are seeing indication that a sub-20 nanometer, some of the lithography challenges being presented by people having to extend 193 is creating a buying cycle both in -- and certainly, in mask shop, it's not as robust as it would be if it were an entirely new generation of mask. But I think that what we don't know and our customers don't know is how much capacity they're going to need to add. And part of that is how many starts are going to actually happen in the sub-20. But we have seen some support for that. The other thing that goes on is in the fab line. And I think that the customers have enjoyed a holiday, a mask makers holiday, if you will, because of the double patterning on relatively simple mask. But again, when you get to sub-20, there's some challenges associated with that. That business is different, we have different offerings for it, that tends to be more cost competitive and not as high tech. And so there's some challenges in terms of satisfying, and there's more competitive pressure in that market. But we have offerings, and we think we can compete in that market. But it's not going to be as the same as what you've seen in the mask shop. So until high volume, EUV comes in, which is several years out, I do think there's going to be some opportunity as we look at sub-20 and some of the lithography challenges. But frankly, it's new enough that our customers don't yet know exactly the implications for their reticle strategy.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up question on the wafer inspection business. You've seen a pickup, and you talked about the record orders this year. You've also mentioned that DRAM spending was up. I think in the past, you've noted that you expect the process control intensity for DRAM to be kind of split between metrology and inspection. I guess, after the last few quarters with DRAM spending has been up, are you seeing more of a bias towards inspection given that metrology is trying to hold steady? Or is that something where metrology will catch up down the line with, I guess, the capacity build on the DRAM side?","Bren Higgins","Great question. I think that the immediate answer is right now, we're seeing probably a little more opportunity in the wafer inspection. But the truth is, there's not enough out there yet at the advanced nodes and DRAM or frankly and what's going on in flash, for our customers to fully appreciate what they're going to need. We've talked about our process control intensity going up. But if you look at -- for example, our 3D NAND model, part of the reality is there hasn't been enough out there to really validate the model yet. But I would say if there's any bias, it would be towards higher levels of adoption and probably more in the inspection side. The caveat being is if in the -- our ability in OCD, in optical CD, to take on more some of the historical SEM-based inspections, I think that does provide some opportunity particularly as people go to more 3D structures then there's probably more growth in that segment. So still early to tell, but I think, right now, to answer your question, I'd say the bias might be a little more towards inspection.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Rick, I'm just wondering what your view is for calendar '15. Do you see any pull-in for -- potentially for 10-nanometer of foundry spending? And if so, do you have any view whether EUV will be used on 10-nanometer?","Richard P. Wallace","We do see some interest in 10-nanometer. In fact, there's -- I don't know, I probably couldn't explain [ph] but there's certainly been customers talking about accelerating 10-nanometer development and very aggressively. And I think, there's a bit of a competitive battle going on in the foundry space to get to the next node. My expectation is that we'll not see high-volume EUV for 10-nanometer, but because there is some capacity out there, I think it only stands to reason that if people want to use 10-nanometer, want to use EUV in 7-nanometer production, they're going to definitely try to get it into 1 layer or 2 for 10-nanometer just to debug it and prove it out. But I think on -- at the same time, customers I talked to about 10-nanometer have -- that is a nice-to-have, not a must-have, to be able to do 10-nanometer. They're certainly going to be capable of doing 10-nanometer without it because they feel like there's some challenges with the productivity in 10-nanometer. But of course, the -- especially those that have some capacity would like to get some learning out of it and some productivity out of it.","Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And on the second half order outlook, you said that memory would be up half-over-half. Do you think that's weighted more toward DRAM or NAND?","Richard P. Wallace","I think in September, right now it looks like it's -- NAND is a higher percentage. We're -- right now, for September, we're forecasting memory overall to be about 27% of the mix or so, 27%, 28%. And NAND will be the bulk of that. I think there is -- but there is investment in both areas. And so -- I just don't have the detail on December but that outlook is for September right now.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA.","Ted Lockwood","Thank you, Liane.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ted Lockwood","Thank you, Candace. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.","As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results.","More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard P. Wallace","Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. KLA-Tencor executed well in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, delivering revenue and EPS in the upper half of the range of guidance and shipments above the top end of the range, and demonstrating market leadership and strong execution across our worldwide operations. New orders were below the range in Q2. As previously indicated, in Q2, a customer delayed a large order for mask inspection tools earmarked for 10-nanometer development. We currently expect that order to book in the first half of calendar year 2014.","Regarding our customer focus and growth objectives, as the market leader on process control, our success is dictated by ongoing productive collaboration with customers, and continuing to innovate and execute so we can bring new products to market. KLA-Tencor advanced our leadership in the December quarter, winning key customer engagements in each of our major end markets. Process control is continuing to play a critical role in enabling the major technology inflections underway at the leading edge, as well as helping customers solve their most complex yield challenges.","Customer highlights in Q2 included adoption of our latest generation broadband plasma inspectors by customers for 14-nanometer pilot programs in foundry and in memory for both 3D NAND and 2X nanometer DRAM projects. KLA-Tencor's broadband plasma inspection platform leads the optical inspection marketplace today in terms of capability and cost of ownership.","In laser scattering wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor extended our leadership in mine monitoring applications in Q2, achieving a significant advantage in head-to-head competition in the quarter, both in terms of dollar and unit share.","Q2 also marked a record for quarterly bookings in our fill measurement and optical CD division. KLA-Tencor's specter shape metrology solution is critical and a successful ramp of leading edge logic and memory devices with complex 3-dimensional shapes, such as FinFET and vertically stacked NAND. Metrology is playing an increasing critical role in the success of our customers' technology roadmaps, as they move beyond traditional scaling in the incorporation of new materials and advanced structures at the leading edge.","Overall, in spite of the bookings data, the December quarter yielded good results for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating the strength of our market leadership, our superior business model and successful execution by our worldwide team.","Now for some perspective on the current industry environment. End demand for our wafer fab equipment continues to be driven by mobility markets and a high level of investment in customer activity at the leading edge. Today, the market leaders are engaged in an all-out race to leverage their scale and technology advantages to gain a competitive advantage. For 2014, our outlook is for a continuation of this multi-year investment cycle, with the aggregate semiconductor industry CapEx expected to grow at approximately 10% for the year. As is typical, we can expect the quarterly spending levels supporting these technology transpositions to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, as our customers address their yield challenges and adjust their capacity plans and outlook throughout the year.","In foundry and logic, the pace of investment in 20-nanometers is accelerating and expected to continue in 2014, with the market leader currently ramping early 20-nanometer capacity, and with broader customer participation expected at 20-nanometer later in 2014. Initial pilot production of FinFET technology at 16- and 14-nanometer is also expected from the leading foundries in 2014. The introduction of FinFET structures and leading edge logic significantly compounds device complexity that drives new requirements for advanced inspection and measurement to address the significant yield challenges associated with ramping these new devices.","In memory, in addition to investment in the 20-nanometer planar roadmap for NAND, the first phase of 3D NAND production has begun and is expected to grow in 2014, with more than one leading edge memory customer announcing intentions to bring 3D NAND devices to market in the year.","For DRAM, tight supply conditions and improved pricing environment are driving higher investments. With the increasing cost and complexity associated with introducing 3D structures in leading-edge memory, we're seeing higher adoption of process control for memory customers, and we're strengthening our competitive position in this end market.","In summary, 2014 is set up to be an exciting year for our industry and for KLA-Tencor, with CapEx growth projected in each of our major end markets. On the technology front, the cost and complexity associated with competing at the leading edge continues to increase, and our customers can no longer rely solely on scaling to achieve their performance and cost improvement targets. With the incorporation of complex new device architectures, materials and processes, such as multi patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging, the number of process steps requiring inspection and measurement is increasing. And our customers are relying more than ever on KLA-Tencor as the market leader in process control as they execute their growth strategies. Against this backdrop of industry growth, customer competition and increasing device complexity, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue our market leadership, to benefit from the expanding need for process control and to deliver greater than industry average growth and superior profitability and stockholder returns in 2014.","Turning now to the guidance for the March quarter. Bookings are expected to increase approximately 10% at the mid-point and be in a range of $700 million to $900 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $790 million and $850 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1 to $1.20 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren.","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. Revenue for Q2 was in the upper half of the range of guidance at $705 million, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.83. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter at the upper end of the guided range at $0.85. In our press release, you'll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.","New orders in Q2 were $728 million, finishing below guidance of $800 million to $950 million for the quarter. As previously discussed at investor conference in nearly December, a significant multiple system mash-up order that was originally scheduled to book in Q2 moved out of the quarter as the customer shifted the delivery dates for these tools into the first half of calendar 2015. These shipments are now expected to revenue in the middle of 2015 instead of in the beginning of that calendar year.","Customer concentration is driving more volatility around the order profiles on a quarterly basis. Though our December orders fell short of our forecast, our aggregate orders across the December and March quarters remain in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion we have been targeting, only slightly below the 6-month outlook that we expected at the beginning of the December quarter. This forecast range is consistent with business levels that would support strong revenue growth for KLA-Tencor in 2014 and strong relative performance for the company in what is expected to be a good year for industry growth.","Turning now to our customer segment commentary. Foundry came in below the original forecast at 47% of new orders for Q2. Foundry demand was slightly weaker than expected due to timing delays for 28-nanometer fill-out capacity, as well as marginal weakness at the leading edge. We believe the near-term foundry pushouts are largely a timing issue and a function of a variety of factors, including our customers' yield improvement activities related to ramping complex leading-edge device technologies and architectures, in addition to new capacity timing at both the leading edge and at 28-nanometer and customer concentration. We see foundry orders increasing in the March quarter, with strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving order growth.","Memory was stronger than expected at 46% of new system orders in December, with upside from DRAM and from the Japan region driving upside in the quarter. We expect memory to decline to 20% of orders in the March quarter, as orders for Phase 1 of the latest NAND capacity project are largely complete and 2 installations are in process. Memory investment remains focused on 3D technology development and new capacity and NAND and technology upgrades in DRAM.","Logic was 7% of new orders in December, slightly below the original forecast. Investment by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 63% of the orders we received in the December quarter.","Turning now to the regional distribution of new system orders in Q2. The U.S. was 26%, up from 22% in the September quarter. Europe was 1%, down from 8%. Japan was 12%, up from 10%. Korea was 18%, flat to September. Taiwan was 30%, up from 26%. And the rest of Asia was 13%, down from 16%. The approximate distribution of orders by product group was: wafer inspection was 43%; reticle inspection was 11%; metrology was 22%; service was 22%; storage, High Brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%.","Total shipments in the quarter were $862 million, up 35% from the September quarter and $32 million above the $830 million mid-point of guidance. Customer pull and activity for shipments of our latest products is encouraging and highlights the demand for the higher performance capability required at the leading edge.","In total, we ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion of total backlog, comprised of $820 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months and $407 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers.","We expect shipments in the March quarter to be down approximately 13% at the mid-point compared with Q2, as the shipment pull-ins from March into December, coupled with delivery timing for key projects, drives a lower output level in the March quarter. March quarter shipments are expected to be in a range of $720 million to $780 million, and current expectations are for shipments to return to the $800 million to $850 million range in the June quarter.","Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $705 million. This result was up 7% quarter-to-quarter. As you may recall, we discussed in last quarter's call that our revenue guidance for the December quarter reflected the impact of high shipment levels of newly introduced products during the quarter. As these are new products, they do not meet our criteria for recognizing revenue upon shipment, so customer acceptance is required on these products for us to recognize the revenue. These systems have met customer expectations, and our product and regional teams have executed our processes well. So we expect we will recognize revenue from these new product shipments in the March quarter.","As discussed last quarter, we expect these factors to result in strong sequential revenue growth in the March quarter. For the March quarter, total revenue is expected to be in a range between $790 million and $850 million. Gross margin was 59.8%, up 160 basis points from the September quarter.","Our gross margin significantly exceeded guidance for the quarter, due to a favorable product mix and better-than-expected manufacturing efficiencies due to the higher factory output. We expect gross margin to be in a range of 58% to 59% in the March quarter, as the benefit of higher revenue volume is offset by a weaker product mix compared to the December quarter. With faster order-to-revenue conversion rates on backlog, our gross margin volatility on product mix has increased. However, over time, we expect our gross margins to perform consistent with our longstanding 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model.","Operating expenses were $228 million, flat from the September quarter and in line with the guidance range of $225 million to $230 million. R&D was $133 million, up $2 million from September, as we continue to invest in key research and development activities and customer collaborations for next generation technologies.","SG&A for the quarter was $96 million, roughly flat compared with Q1. We are continuing to size the company's quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range and expect it to remain in this range for the next few quarters. The timing of product development investments will lead to some fluctuation within this range quarter-to-quarter.","Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $11 million, up $1 million from the September quarter. We expect OIE to be a net expense in March, between $10 million and $11 million. The tax rate was 21.5% in the quarter, lower than the 23% planning rate, principally driven by an increase in offshore income relative to the U.S. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share would have been $0.83.","Going forward, you should continue to use the long-term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Net income was $143 million or $0.85 per fully diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investment ended the quarter at $2.95 billion, essentially unchanged versus the September quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased $60 million of stock at an average price of $62.87. As of December 31, we had 3.9 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization.","We paid a dividend of $75 million in the quarter. In July, we raised our dividend per share $0.05 to $0.45 per share. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend.","Cash from operations was $115 million in the quarter, down $62 million sequentially, as expected, due primarily to higher accounts receivable associated with the ramp in shipments.","Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $573 million, up $132 million from the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding based on shipments were 61 days.","Net inventory increased nominally by $3 million quarter-to-quarter to $663 million to support expected shipment levels for 2015.","Inventory turns on GAAP COGS were 1.7x, flat to the September quarter.","Net capital expenditures were $14 million to support continued facility expansion activities worldwide.","Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over $168 million and are expected to remain roughly flat in the March quarter.","Full-time headcount ended the quarter at 5,981.","Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of the business environment at the leading edge. We expect that the yield challenges associated with multi-patterning and FinFET will drive sustainable process control investment by foundry and logic customers through 2014. Continued investments in technology buys, in DRAM and 3D NAND development and early production activity, should lead to an increase in overall memory spending versus 2013.","Given these expectations, we continue to believe that semiconductor industry CapEx in 2014 will be up about 10% versus 2013. Given process control adoption during node transitions and our market position, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to outperform the overall capital equipment industry in 2014.","With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the quarter is bookings are expected to be within a range of $700 million to $900 million; revenue between $798 million and $850 million; and EPS of $1 to $1.20.","This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Ted Lockwood","Okay. Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions].","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Bren, does the order guidance in March, does that assume that the pushed out reticle business books in March? And then I have a follow-up.","Bren Higgins","Yes, Tim. As we roll it up. I mean, I think, as I said at the end of last quarter, I think that business shifts into the first half. I think, right now, we expect it to book in March. But as I had indicated in the past, I think there is some fluidity to this particular order because the delivery date is further out. So right now, our expectations are that we'll see this business book. But, obviously, there's an extra element of risk with it. And I think because of the size of the ASPs associated with this particular quarter, it is something that has driven our views on, perhaps, maybe a wider range may be appropriate. This, coupled with just general customer concentration, overall, large orders. So that's how we're thinking about it today.","Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Rick, there's been a lot of talk about EUV and about the insertion point and a lot of confusion about what TSM has said about EUV and what they haven't said about EUV. But can you just give your perspective? Because it seems like these chip makers are able to push out the need for EUV by just extending emergence. So I'm curious, your perspective on the timing of EUV.","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. I think that the timing has moved out, from my perspective, especially for high-volume manufacturing. And the insertion point at 10 nanometers, I think, is now pushed to 7. Although there still could be a couple areas at 10. But one of the indications we have was the industry's need for an at-wavelength reticle tool. We have seen that push out. Because -- well, the feedback we get from customers is they believe they can make do with what they have in terms of using our 6xx because it's relatively low volume. And it's all about the economics. EUV remains too slow to be put into production on an economic base. So there's a lot of work to do to get the source up, to get the throughput up. But right now, what we're getting from customers is double patterning is more and more the plan of record as they go to 10 nanometers, and that puts EUV and high HBM more at the 7-nanometer node. And that's how we're currently planning.","Operator","And your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Over the past couple of months, it seems as though there has been a firming of your customers' programs and projects across all segments. CapEx outlooks have been provided to the markets. I believe you're still projecting 10% WFE growth this year. But relative to your view 3 months ago, has anything changed as it relates to CapEx spend by segment? It seems like foundry and DRAM could be a bit stronger than previously anticipated. But would love to get your views.","Bren Higgins","Well, I think, on the nearer term -- I think, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks -- in December, we did see a little bit of weakness which we've really attributed more to timing related to non-leading edge foundry and, at the leading edge, some adjustments to some capacity planning. So on the whole, relative to 3 months ago, I think our view is slightly weaker, as I had said. I think in terms of how we're thinking about 2014, we feel pretty confident. It's always hard to say how or where it's going to land from an order and shipment perspective. But in terms of our overall views on the remainder of the year, we still believe that we're looking at somewhere around plus 10%. And as you said, I think as you see more input from customers, in terms of their discussions about next year's planning, I think overall, from a year perspective, we feel pretty good about that forecast today.","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then the team has talked about the migration to sub-20 nanometers driving a mix that is more focused on some of your high-end inspection tools, like your broadband plasma platform, let's say, versus your darkfield line monitoring products. So given all of the migrations that are taking place across your customer base, how are you seeing that sort of current order mix playing out? Are you seeing that it is being more relatively skewed towards high end and any way to quantify this mix or mixed shift relative to, let's say, 18 to 24 months ago?","Richard P. Wallace","Sure. This is Rick. I think that the best way to think about it is the way we laid out the segments and the process control intensity back at our Analyst Day in July. And that is that at 2x you see an increase, overall increase, in process control intensity. And we baseline 4x to 2x from 13.7% blended to 14.7%. So an increase of over 10% in terms of the overall from 13.7% to 14.7%. But -- I guess a little under 10%. But we were basing that partly on the increased adoption of the more advanced tools. And so 2 things have happened. One, the laser-based tools have gotten more complex as you go down, and therefore, higher ASPs. And the broadband plasma also has advanced. And I'd say the mix is more dependent on where you are in the ramp, but I think we laid that out. Early in the ramp, you tend to see more of the broadband plasma tools, and then as the ramp progresses, the laser scanning tools come in. But all of them, because they're more capable, provide more value. And with that comes higher ASP, which is a big part of what drives the overall WFE number. So, so far, what we've seen since we laid out that model publicly but also since we started modeling it probably 24 months ago, it's pretty much conforming to what we thought it would be in terms of that. And we have seen strength in both product lines as we've increased the intensity associated with the new nodes. Does that make sense?","Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, makes sense.","Operator","And your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The first question I had is very close. In terms of your March quarter guidance for memory orders, 20% of your bookings is going to be memory. What is the split between DRAM and NAND? And also, along the 3D NAND side, you said Phase 1 is almost complete for the leader. When do you expect Phase 2 to start ordering?","Bren Higgins","Yes, Krish, it's Bren. I'll go ahead and start. So NAND as a percent of the memory mix is 40%. So 60-40 DRAM to NAND in the March quarter. We've had 4 pretty good quarters from a memory mix perspective and so we think that March is a little bit lower. To my point in the prepared remarks, as most of the orders came in, in the second half, mostly in the September quarter related to the significant project in China. And so those tools shipped in the December quarter and those tools are being installed today. There will be a second phase and we think it's a big part of what happens in 2014. That second phase happens some time midyear and into the fall in terms of timing of deliveries. So that's what we're planning today. And no indications that things are not on track there and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing in terms of the installations and the new tools going in.","Richard P. Wallace","And the other part of your question, I think, talked about other players. We do see other players coming in, in '14, probably toward the later part of '14, for 3D, and maybe 1 or 2 more players in that time frame, depending on how technology development goes for them. But I do think it will be a competitive market if you view out 12 months from now. My estimation is there'll probably be 3 players with that capability and development and ramping.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. Rick, I remember your SEMICON slides on process control intensity growing. I was just wondering, just if I look at foundry specifically, when you go from 20 planar to 16 or 14 FinFET, is there a way to quantify what is the increase in the sam [ph] for you guys?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we did it with steady-state, the steady-state assumption about process control intensity. So it depends how much they're investing in the node obviously. But we had the increase, we had the logic foundry at 2x being 17% going to 18.4%. So not quite a 10% increase in the sam [ph] just from that node transition. But as you know, it depends on where you are in the ramp, it depends on which particular players and what kind of challenges they're facing. But I think, overall, we're continuing to see that kind of pressure, driven largely, of course, by the FinFET challenges with yield, but also the multi-patterning that's more prevalent once you go to the 1x, given the current lithography options people have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jack Sheng - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Jack Sheng on behalf of Jim Covello. So my first question is, given your view on WFE spending this year, can you just give us an idea of on the weighting of that spending between first half and second half? In addition, can I also get some color on the differences between logic, foundry and memory?","Bren Higgins","Jack, this is Bren. So I think, in terms of weighting, I'm not really ready to call that yet. I think the biggest wildcard in that is, at least from an order perspective, will be timing related to some significant projects that are going to happen in that sort of midyear to fall time frame. But we mentioned the memory project earlier. There are a couple significant projects on the foundry logic side as well. I think the deliveries are fairly firm on those projects in the second half of the year or so. And I think the timing of those, the order placement, I think, is one question in terms of whether the first half of the year is stronger or weaker than the second half. So we'll see how that goes in terms of timing. In terms of mix, overall, I think foundry and logic probably grows in line with market about 10% or so. We think NAND flash is probably up somewhere between 10% and 15%. And we're a little bit more cautious on DRAM just because historically, there's just been more volatility there. So there's some growth there but off a low base. So that's how we're thinking about it. And I think when you think about the overall mix, you probably end up with foundry and logic somewhere around 60% to 65%, the memory 35% to 40%, in terms of how we're thinking about it today.","Jack Sheng - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's incredibly helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, so many of your competitors have been pretty vocal about gaining share over you guys this year. So with that said, how should we think about share shifts and markets such as e-beam and low-beam inspection going forward?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we -- when we look at the market share data over the last several years, in spite of a lot of claims that people have made they're gaining share, we actually feel pretty good about our position and don't really see much evidence of share loss. In fact, in some of our most important segments, we've actually moved ahead. And some of our products it's actually quite hard to measure share. For example, our broadband plasma, there's really not another broadband plasma tool. There are laser-scanning tools, but they compete with our laser scanning where we have a pretty good position. So -- and that -- as I -- if I look out -- I look back and I look forward, I don't see a lot of change in the share position. I do see some potential going forward for some gains on our side. But I don't really -- right now, we've not been experiencing any real significant challenges that make me change our view of our share position. There are always bumps in the road as there have been in the past in certain segments at certain times. But in aggregate, we feel very good about our position and confident we can maintain it going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I believe you alluded earlier to a statement regarding capital intensity of memory and inspection increasing. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more.","Richard P. Wallace","Sure, Terence. We laid out in SEMICON West we're sticking with the analysis we did, which had, just to remind people, 4x node at about 8.8% capital intensity. As compared to logic and foundry, by the way, it's 15.8%. So significantly less but still increasing, 2x going to 9.3%, and then 1x going to 10.2%. But the other way you can think about 1x is being V-NAND being equivalent even though that's not technically a 1x node. In fact, it goes backwards in terms of lithography technology. But it is increased in overall opportunity for us. And since we laid that out, and we had that model before we laid it out, we've seen market behavior pretty much in order with that dynamic of what we've forecasted of about a 10% increase from the 4x, the 2x node and then another, not quite 10%, but on that order, increase as we go to the V-NAND node.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, terrific, Rick, and then, I believe that you talked a little bit earlier about EUV. My question specifically is, does the change in insertion in EUV that seems to be a consensus now, does that affect any of your investments in EUV reticle inspection? And where are you in the process of developing reticle inspection for EUV?","Richard P. Wallace","It will certainly change our ramping up of our investment. We will maintain core technology and continue to invest. But it -- there have been different scenarios in which we would have ramped that investment over the next couple of years. And what we talked about at SEMICON West was doing that in conjunction and partnership with our key customers to be able to support that ramp. We don't believe that, that's as eminent as people believed it was 9 months ago based on the delays and productivity gains on the scanner. So we will continue to invest, but it'll be at -- we won't see a ramp as we had forecasted going forward. But again, that was going to be shared with customers. So Bren can speak to the implication that has to the overall model. But in general, we won't be ramping our investment as soon as we originally planned.","Bren Higgins","Yes, so Terence, I think that from an EUV perspective, we've been essentially investing in early development activity, technological feasibility work. And so we continue to do that obviously, having the ability to continue to progress here and maintain some optionality around this. It's important for us. But I don't expect inflection on spending, and that's why I feel pretty comfortable with the guidance around our OpEx sort of flattening out here at this level over the next several quarters.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm a little bit confused, Rick. If I were to take the $100 million out of your March guide, it suggests to me that the core business declined by 8% compared to September and March will be down 4%. And we have been waiting for these turns, especially from foundry side, for almost 12 months. So where is the turn? And from what I hear from now, there is incremental emphasis on 3D NAND. Can you help me reconcile the trend and how you see things evolving? Because your booking trend is not really giving me much confidence. And I have a follow-up.","Bren Higgins","Well, as I said, I mean, I think that it is a bit of a wide range because we're not exactly sure how the reticle inspection business sort of ends up here at the end of the quarter. I mean, as I said earlier, there has been a little bit of weakness on the foundry and logic side of things over the December quarter and into March in terms of timing around some of the non-leading-edge activity. And I think some rational, not with the rationalization, but some digestion, if you will, around some of the wafer start plans for particular customers on the leading edge. So we think that, that resolves itself. It's mostly about timing. And I think, as I said earlier, I mean, fluctuations quarter-to-quarter here in our order profile, given the size of the orders, the number of customers, the big ASPs and so on, can cause a little bit of volatility there. I don't think the order number is as a cyclical indicator, perhaps, as it used to be, as the industry has changed. As we look at calendar '14, we continue to believe, consistent with the revenue guidance for the March quarter, that we're operating at $800 million to $850 million range from a revenue perspective. We'll see some fluctuations in orders, to a larger extent in shipment. But that's how we see the year and that's how we're sizing the company to support the dynamics they're having in the industry.","Richard P. Wallace","Yes. I'd also just add to that. I think what we saw in September was uncharacteristically strong for that part of the cycle. Typically, September, we don't have enough quarter like that. And I think, in effect, what we had was some pull-in to the September quarter from December and then we did actually have a little pushout from September -- from December into March. But to Bren's point, when we aggregate it and we look out, it's still pretty much falling in line with what we believed would happen if you integrate it over time. And I think, as we look out for '14, that's pretty consistent with our view as well.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure. Let me ask the question a different way. You talked about $800 million to $850 million of shipments for the June. Would you have to hit the high end of your booking guide to do that shipment in June, given where your backlog is?","Bren Higgins","No, I think given just timing in terms of where deliveries are lining up, it's driving a lower number than you would expect in the March quarter. And I think, as we move into June, we'll see that, that ramp pick -- we'll see a ramp in shipments in June, which is why I put that color into the prepared remarks. So I think that's consistent with general views around the current views of the range in the midpoint to be able to make that happen. Obviously, if you were to come in the extreme low end of the range or below that and then perhaps those plans would change. But given our backlog and the lead time we get from customers, we feel pretty good about how those quarters are shaking out.","Richard P. Wallace","And also, Mehdi, the other thing is on those -- on that bookings, to some degree, the bookings we're talking about that have been in question, some of the reticle bookings, wouldn't ship in June anyway, right? So that's more a part of the -- what it would look like in terms of where we are in that range. And that's part of the wildcard and the wide range for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Farhan, asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is on memory. If I look at the long-term trend, KLAC's orders in memory segment have outpaced your peers' and I just wanted to understand better, like what's driving the long-term growth on a relative basis to your peers in terms of memory growing at a faster rate for KLA. Is it more of a market trend or more of a market share trend?","Richard P. Wallace","Great question. I think there's 2 elements. One, our share has definitely increased in memory. We've focused on that a few years ago. It didn't show up because there wasn't a lot of memory activity and so when finally the memory guys started spending, we benefited from that trend. The other thing is that the process control intensity has increased with the new design roles. And lastly, I think that the memory manufacturers have recognized the value of getting memory process control capability early in the ramp or for technology development. So part of what we're seeing is accelerated demand earlier in the cycle. I think it does normalize over time to the process control intensity we talked about at SEMICON West. So in some ways, we'll get -- we'll benefit very early in the ramp. There's also some technology catch-up. There were people that were doing investments were on hold for a while, I think, while they were integrating acquisitions and so on. And once they got focused again on manufacturing at new nodes, they invested. So I think it's a combination of those 3 factors: increased share, increased investment, process control intensity and timing of where they are in the cycle.","Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And just one question on the June shipments. I mean, your -- if I adjust for the $100 million of orders, the guidance for March quarter orders is in the range of -- it's lower than the December quarter. You're basically guiding to $600 million to $800 million. How can you get a shipment growth in June quarter? Because the $100 million order won't start shipping in the June quarter. So the June quarter orders need to increase significantly, is that a fair assumption?","Bren Higgins","Also I'm not guiding the June quarter shipments. I was just giving some color on our expectations about the range. When we get there, we'll actually provide a number. But as I look at the build plans today and the timing of some of these shipments, I would have expected, given our expectations for the quarter, that shipments would have been a little bit higher this quarter. But as I said it was all about where delivery timing is set up. So as I look at the June quarter, given our expectations for orders in the next 6 months, plus our backlog position, I was comfortable with providing the color statement that I gave around $800 million to $850 million range. So that's how we're thinking about it. And we'll see -- around those reticle inspection shipments, we'll see where those ultimately end up landing from an order perspective. And as I said earlier, that's why we're -- I've expanded the range to see how -- to deal with that potential risk.","Operator","And your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Mahavir. Just one question about order profile for calendar '14. Rick, you talked about a number of memory projects in the second half. And if you look at the memory order guidance for the March quarter, it's at $160 million roughly and your peak was about $300 million back in September quarter. Just wondering if we should think about order profile as perhaps growing throughout 2014 or kind of bucking the trend, if you will, in the September quarter when you typically have a decline.","Bren Higgins","Yes. As I said earlier, I think it's hard to say in terms of the timing of that business midyear. And I think I mentioned one significant memory project. The others were foundry and logic projects that are out there in that time frame. So we'll just have to see, from a timing perspective, where they land. I mean, one situation that we do deal with today is we do get less lead time than we used to get historically, so in terms of order to shipment. So there is some fluidity, if you will, in terms of the timing. But in terms of how we're lining up the rest of the year, we see ourselves operating in this range of $800 million to $850 million and orders could come in above that level, orders could come a little bit below that level in the 12-month or 12-week cycle. But at the end of the day, we think we're going to -- we're operating at that level.","Operator","Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just real quickly, you had mentioned advanced packaging is one of the drivers for growth. And I just wondered if you could give us some idea how much of that really could be contributing at this point and potentially how big that market could be and maybe even if you could lay it out over the next couple of years, that would be helpful.","Richard P. Wallace","Not much. I mean, we're not counting on advanced packaging for calendar '14 to significantly contribute. We do have some investigations developments there. But we're not -- that's not in our baseline for what we're seeing out for the rest of this year.","Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","So -- understood. But since you mentioned it as one of the drivers for growth, can you give us an idea of how the market could evolve maybe for you?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we have some plan and I do think there are -- if you look out a couple of years, there's probably $100 million or so of opportunity on an annualized basis for us there but we're not seeing that today. We're seeing maybe part of that and so I do think there's some growth opportunity. But it's -- it would be high growth rate just off of a reasonably small base.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, I just want to follow up on your commentary on the foundry. Can you give your view on what do you think is driving the delay or pushout of the foundry, especially the -- I'm interested in the 20-nanometer? Is it that customer is having issue ramping or that the demand has pushed out? That would be very helpful.","Richard P. Wallace","I think there's a couple of things. One, there's -- certainly, not everybody is delaying. So I think it's more -- the leaders are still going and then there's there some delay behind. And I think the delays tend to be around a combination of factors. One is getting the process right, so the yield is there so they can ramp. The other one is I do think there is a bit of churn going on based on some management changes in some of the foundries. And I think that's creating, at least, a pause, as people are regrouping and trying to figure out different kind of partnership strategies and who might be doing what for whom.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I think that makes perfect sense. On -- and there's one -- I want to follow up on the EUV reticle inspection. I know you mentioned in the past that you would need in order of $500 million of investment from your partners to be able to invest in that project. What's the response? Is the customers, they're not willing to do that or they want to wait and -- but they would do it? What's the response on that -- your proposal?","Richard P. Wallace","Well, we said, just to clarify, $500 million we thought was the total cost and we were looking to share that. So not $500 million from them but $500 million in total. The response was there was a lot of interest last summer and earlier last year. But it was all contingent on people feeling like the insertion point was going to be as planned. I think every one of the major partners we talked to indicated their belief that the insertion was delaying and, therefore, their urgency waned quite a bit. So they're all very interested. Many have said, not just the overall companies, but individuals, that they think it's a must because the need for pellicles is becoming clear on EUV. The challenge with the need for pellicles is -- the need for pellicles also means more power is needed because the pellicle actually consumes some of the power. But it does drive the market to need an actinic tool in high-volume manufacturing. But the biggest issue is the perceived delay in the timing of that high volume. So interest, but not yet at the point of us securing funding where that looked [ph]. I'd say much more promising if I go back 9 months in terms of it being a near term. And we're in agreement with our customers that we don't want to be investing in a capability that they don't need because jointly there are great, high-return projects we could do. And so instead, we're focusing our efforts on supporting the multi-patterning challenges that people are going to face as the alternative to EUV.","Operator","And your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So first one is on gross margin. This past quarter, you have a margin expansion. You mentioned favorable mix. Just wanted to know if that's metrology inspection or customer mix, any kind of color around that? And then I noticed that you guys are effectively guiding margin to be lower in the coming quarter but your revenue backlog actually expanded and you have more tools being signed off by customers. Why are you guiding margin to be lower?","Bren Higgins","Yes. So gross margins in the December quarter were stronger than expected and our product mix was a little bit richer than what we thought it would be in the October quarter or at the October call. So we're higher in wafer inspection. Obviously, it has higher gross margin and so that was a part of that as well as higher-end reticle inspection as well. As I look into the March quarter, I mean, we are benefiting. And then, of course, I think also in the December quarter, efficiencies in manufacturing were favorable to our planning. So we had a very strong incremental gross margin in March outperforming -- or in December outperforming our model, 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. We'll underperform it a little bit in the March quarter as the mix is less favorable. But I think when you think about it, over the 6-month time frame, I think the incremental gross margins are high 60s, 68%, 69%. So a little bit of volatility driven by some of the dynamics I mentioned earlier. So it depends what you're shipping and as those tools revenue that drives gross margin. We do have, obviously, a number of products in the company and they all have different margin profiles. So mix is probably a bigger factor for us than it is for some of our peers.","Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then for -- I think, Rick, you mentioned on your prepared remark that you have record order for OCD and metrology is very strong. Was wondering if that's driven by the kind of foundry or the logic side. Or are you seeing incremental demand on the memory side because of things like 3D NAND? What's the driver for the stronger booking? And is this a sustainable trend?","Richard P. Wallace","I think it is. I -- not -- probably not quarter-to-quarter, just the way the orders tend to come in kind of lumpy that way. But what's driving it is really 3D structures, both in memory, but also in logic. That and finally having capability to meet the needs. It's a very tough technical challenge, and it's taken our team who has done incredible work -- it takes a lot of work to get to having solutions that are robust enough to work in production. But we've made a lot of progress and I think we're seeing the benefit from that. And as we forecast going forward, I think it's a -- it's not a technically a share opportunity in the sense that we have a large share. I think it's a share opportunity in terms of against the alternatives, which historically, CD SEMs have been the primary use for -- primarily used for CD measurement. But I think the optical has a lot of capability, especially when you're dealing with the 3D structures.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, maybe first, can you give a little more color in terms of the 3D NAND opportunity? When you mentioned the process control intensity being above 10% [indiscernible], is there a waiting or a bias towards inspection or metrology? Or is it kind of a mix of both kind of 50-50 split in terms of the increasing process control intensity for 3D NAND?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I don't think there's much difference actually. There's, I guess, probably, I'd say, maybe a little metrology bias because overlay becomes a bigger challenge. I do think that the 3D inspection challenge is pretty significant as well. But I think probably, it's a little biased toward metrology. But I wouldn't say by a lot. I don't have the data in front of me. But my gut says it's probably a little more metrology focused, although we had success with inspection. I mean, one of the big challenges people had and their fears, and I think we're not out of the woods yet because nobody's really ramped in production on it, was trying to figure out how, once you identify defects, you can deal with them because they're going to be varied and what is the -- how do you determine the root cause and then fix it. And we've got some clever inspection technology, as well as metrology and technology, to be able to penetrate those layers. But there's still this issue of fixing and moving forward. But overall, if I'd have to tip it, I'd tip it a little more toward the metrology side.","Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's really helpful. And maybe a big-picture industry outlook. I think you've given us a good color of what you expect for 2014. But obviously, there are always a lot of moving pieces. If the industry does trend, and you've seen many of these upturns, a lot of time they track higher than expected. If there are key customer variables as we get into the second half of the year, where do you see the potential upside between foundry and, say, memory? Where's the greater chance for upside potential as the year progresses?","Richard P. Wallace","Wow, it's a good question. I don't have a great answer. I guess I would say foundry because I think there is -- foundry can be driven like -- I guess both can be driven by this opportunity for share gain. But foundry, in particular, I think there's a lot of dynamics around that and I do think the fabless companies would like to be able to have alternatives. And so if you have success of the advanced nodes at multiple foundries, I think you could see investment tracking that. Memory guys, I think, are going to have to prove out 2 things. One, the DRAM technologies. And we know that, overall, they're not as capital-intensive as the foundries would be. And then 3D, I think, you could have the followers to the leader come in. But I'd say, again, if I had to bias it, I'd say probably a little more toward the foundry and logic phase toward the end of the year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Ben Pang with Northland Capital.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","First, just to follow up on the EUV pushout. How long does it take you to develop your part of this technology?","Richard P. Wallace","2017, 2018 is what we'd said we'd have a production tool had we gone and followed the investment plan. So I think we're looking closer toward 2020 based on what I anticipate a massive -- a one-node essentially shift toward HBM. Now we do have capability in our 6xx, and I think customers will utilize that for the relatively small volume. But I would say that the HBM that's going to require actinic reticle is pushed out.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","And when you talk about small volumes in terms of just the number of layers, that would be a 1 or 2 layer you would look at it as high volume or small volume?","Richard P. Wallace","Low volume. And I think what will happen is there's going to be a number of EUV scanners out there that are already -- people are committed to getting. There's a number, they're going to want to use. And once they're out there, they're going to want to try what they can to get in some production. But they're relatively low throughput. So they're going to get a couple of layers. On their own, economically, they wouldn't have probably passed. But since they're already out there, they're going to get used. But there's not going to be a massive ecosystem development to support that. That's what I'm talking about. That's the HBM stuff. So it's not inconsistent with the idea that there's going to be a number of scanners out there. They're just not going to be doing a lot of layers on them.","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up on the reticle inspection pushout. Is that an indication that 10-nanometer has also pushed out then?","Bren Higgins","Well, it's about -- yes, that was what we said in December. That the customers had split their delivery date, and it -- because they split the delivery date, they split the PO placements. So those delivery dates slipped into the first half of 2015. And as a result, the orders will slip into the first half of this year. So we're planning for them. But I'm always a little cautious. Once you've had one move and a point -- there is some fluidity around those plans. And perhaps, one slips into June. And it -- and then which is why we wanted to set the order guidance the way we did in terms of the range. Because at $30 million, you can have a sales impact on, and you'll end up the course [indiscernible].","Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. My question is more, is that an industry trend or just specific customer?","Richard P. Wallace","Yes, I'll jump in on that. I don't think it's a big trend. I think it's -- we're talking about the timing and I think they're -- they do have capability to handle some of the development with the existing tool. And this is to get to higher volume. So I think -- and Bren's point, it's a 3- to 6-month kind of delay. And these are people that were ahead. So I don't know that it's an industry issue.","Bren Higgins","The issue will come is if everybody else, when they're -- the whole industry struggles on the FinFET technology, what does that do overall, does that push everything? And that's gotten a lot of people's attention, the challenges associated with FinFET.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters.","Ted Lockwood","Thank you, operator. And on behalf of management, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Ed Lockwood","Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2016. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Wallace","Good afternoon, everyone. Two weeks ago we held a conference call reintroducing the KLA-Tencor story to our stockholders featuring a message that highlighted how our strategies for growth based on market leadership, customer focus, and operational execution provided the foundation for the outstanding results we achievement in fiscal year 2016 and set the stage for an exciting future for the company as we move forward.","Today I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast highlighted by strong foundry mentioned [ph]. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the Top Tier of all technology company in terms of returning cash to shareholders.","Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stakeholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirm KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complimentary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge.","And the pace of new production introduction continued at a rapid clip. Over the last 12 months we have launched two new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection, as well as new products and laser scanning wafer inspection, being review unpattern wafer inspection and mass inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications, critical to both, EUV and advanced optical lithography design role development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high volume in-line monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10 nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations, both in terms of market reception and operational execution.","We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mass inspection. Our leading edge mass inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customers optical mass inspection technique but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify mask for this very important technology inflexion. So to summarize our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017.","Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successful execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against the backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year.","Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter; Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the mid-point of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?","Bren Higgins","Thanks, Rick and good afternoon. The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range driven by strengthening gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace.","Revenue for Q1 was $751 million and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of $0.03 difference. With the exception of when I exclusively refer the GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends. End market mix estimates for the December quarter based on current forecast.","Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September; foundry bookings featured strong demands across our product portfolio to support leading edge development projects although foundry expected decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing. We are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year. Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1 with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project build out in Korea. Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix.","In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders, patterning was approximately 33% of orders; the patterning order profile includes mass inspection system bookings, service was 28% and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and then the upper half for the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modelling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the mid-point and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million.","Turning now to the income statement; revenue was $751 million finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter, and our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16 consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters.","Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 in nearly flack compared with the record goes to margin results we posted in the June quarter in spite the sequential quarterly decline in revenue, the strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter. Lower part expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions, we expect gross margins to be in a range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable of product mix in the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue. ","Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter and operating margin with 33.8% a quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million dollar level, plus or minus a few million the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage and what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. Our effected tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes. ","Finally, net income for the September quarter with $182 million and we ended the quarter with $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turnout of the highlights from the balance sheet in our cash for statement. Cash and investment end of the quarter $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in a quarter. And free cash flow with $160 million. In September, we paid in aggregate of $89 million and regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units, and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loans. ","To date, the total amount of payments of principally on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since have added in the December quarter 2014. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor result in September signals a strong start for the company in FY 17 in coupled with expectations for the December quarter, position a company for strong relative growth versus the way for fab equipment marketing counter 16. This performance demonstrate the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solution addressing the most critical yield requirement of the leading edge, and our operational core competencies. ","Given our strong backlog in the expected growth trajectory new orders, including a book to bill forecast of greater than one in the December quarter, and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016 KLA-Tencor into position for year of solid growth in 2017. With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is shipments in the range of 800 million to 880 million. Revenue between $805 million and $865 million. And non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48 per share with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share.","This concludes our remarks in the quarter I will now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A.","Ed Lockwood","Okay, thank you Bren. At this point we would like to open up the call to Q&A, and we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to reach your follow up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call, as time permits. Christine, we are ready for our first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you so much, I had two -- nice job guys; I guess the first question is really wreck on 7 nanometer. You know the last really economical new in foundry we had was 28 nanometer but recently a host of companies, most recently TSMC are now talking about 7 nanometer being very big, maybe even as big as 28 was. So am curious on getting your perspective on way for demand at that note and how much of this maybe has been bought already in the orders you've got for 10 in the third calendar quarter and how much that is still on the comp? Thanks.","Rick Wallace","Thank Tim, I was in Asia last week revisiting and getting reacquainted with our customer base and there is a lot of excitement I think about the potential for 7 nanometer to your point. Most of the investment that we've seen so far, in terms of production investment has been for 10 nanometer, we have seen investment for the development in 7 and even some looking forward to 5 so I think most of what happened was today that we've seen is 10 and we do expect to see continued strength as we go forward in for 7 nanometer. Bren, anything to add to that?","Bren Higgins","Yes, I think Tim, you know we've had foundries very strong and we even know a drop off this quarter, we think we see a bounce back into the first half of calendar 2017. There's always a dynamic about how the capacity openly get sell by the people following the leaders and so customers will try to optimize their capacity, as much as they can, so to the extent they try to use some of that equipment they may try, but and then given the challenges in a node and what we're hearing about size of it, we feel pretty confident about that foundry trajectory into the calendar year. ","Timothy Arcuri","Thanks a lot. And just a second thing, I-- wanted to talk a little about memory because it looks like there's some uptake in the-- adoption of inspection in memory here in the next round of orders, you have cited a some big orders coming out of Korea during the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what's going in memory? Is there an uptake in inspection in intensity, in memory and particularly why it is happening and can it sustain going forward, thanks. ","Rick Wallace","Yes, it is not just inspection I think process control in general, we are-- seeing some strength and I think it kind of goes across the portfolio. I would attribute the increase in inspection to memory which we have seen some, is more a function of Gen 5 where we've had some placements there that maybe in the past might of been served by alternate technologies like EVM, so we've seen some strength, I'll be modest at this point. The metrology is also growing and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges in terms of things like registration, and so the overlay business and some of the film's businesses. So we're feeling pretty good about it, it's not at the intensity levels of course of foundry, but it is significantly up from where it had been in prior nodes and then we see strength to going forward there. ","Timothy Arcuri","Thank you guys, appreciate it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I had question on Gen 5 just in terms of how -- where you're seeing that option of Gen 5 verses Gen 4, and how we should think about the ramp of Gen 5 next year, and also even at the Analyst Day at Semicon [ph], you had first talked about Gen 5, you talked about potential to gain some of the layers from EVM applications and is that something that you already starting to see? ","Rick Wallace","Farhan, thanks for the question, yes we do pretty good about Gen 5 I think that what we were hoping for is to get it out mainly as a discovery tool. So way back in Semicon [ph] and 2015 we talked about the discovery market and our goal overtime was to get to 50% of that market served by optical. I think by the run rate we have now the end of calendar 2016 we're dressing about a third of that markets, so I think we've got about a third of that market, and our target remains that by the end of 2017 to be 50% of that market. Part of the market grew a little bit, because EVM was just not capable of satisfying some of it, so there is a gap in terms of functionality in terms of whole wafer but the displacement I think is going on we're seeing Gen 5 adopted more broadly. Gen 5 really does not go into production and replaced Gen4 until future notes when the critical defects size gets smaller, and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography.","So, for now it's doing what we hoped it would do, customers like what they see it's a new products so of course there's improvements that we need to keep making, but we think we're on track for the plan that we laid out little over a year and three months ago. ","Bren Higgins","What I really want to add to that; is that we're pretty much in line with what we thought would be we have 4 or 5 units revenue in this calendar year, and then that number would probably double or so will take 8 to 10 units into calendar 2017. So to Rick's point given our objectives in the in the 2017 we think that is how the adoption plays out. most of what we're seeing in terms of 10 nanometer production is really being driven by the Gen 4 product line, receptions just been really strong for that in its capability, so we're really encouraged by that, the extend ability we think and have this move into seven and the two will be mixed and matched and impaired to meet discovery high end production, and then ultimately high volume production type use cases. ","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And my second question on the foundries of -- There's been a big growth in foundry investments in China this year, I wanted to understand like from your perspective how much of the foundry demand this year that is coming out of China -- China foundries. And as you think about the 28 nanometer down put those foundries, how do you think that will play bigger advantage as you typically have like a very strong of process control intensity a 28 nanometer some of the first wave of foundry investment that we saw.","Rick Wallace","So on the foundry business overall, I mean we had a record year in China in FY16, so the year that ended in June in bookings so that those tools of these new revenue in through the course of this year. So I would say of our total foundry business in the year maybe 30%, 35% or so of the total is probably foundry.","Bren Higgins","Yes, and then in terms I was there last week and meeting with customers and I think that 28 nanometer demand, this is that there's a lot of investment going on as you know, there's a lot of new employees. I think they are counting on us to help educate, train, and support them as they wrap these new fabs and they got very aggressive ramp. So I think we look forward to good business and be able support our customers as they go through there, and I think that we see the intensity being somewhere, in fact in some ways because in many cases you're starting greenfield for some these facilities, the intensity ends up being front and loaded for some of them, so it's even higher as well as we go forward. So we're looking forward to great things that in our China operations. ","Rick Wallace","Yes to clarify I meant 30% to 35% of the foundry business with China. ","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you, that's all.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Harlan Sur [ph] from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and the great margin profiles. given the view of WFP [ph] growth next year and obviously your business going in line or better than that, we should see the team you know roughly around $3.3 billion in revenues in calendar 2017 combination of industry growth, momentum and Jen 4, Gen 5 in your other new products. If you continue to drive the better performance in the margin funds, feels like operating margins in that kind of 36% to 38% range would seem achievable, I'm not asking you guys to endorse the $3.3 billion revenue number, but if you were to beat those levels, does 36% to 30% operating margin sound reasonable.","Bren Higgins","Harlan, its Bren. So I mean just following the map to the point that we think that we're going to grow sort of in line with the market in the next year, and the market forecast that that we laid out, you end up with that revenue level I think that's fair. I think we're seeing some tail winds in gross margin right now that we've seen or -- for several quarters but I think as we start to transition into some of the newer products, some of the benefits we've seen around warranty and support costs, and an efficient cycle times and things like that. I think some of that goes away now.","I do think and as I said in the in the call a couple weeks ago, I do believe that versus the model we published that were operating probably a solid 100 basis points above what we had put out there. so and I think that sustainable, so I think some of what we're seeing today be hard for me to come to replicate that type of gross margin profound in next year, so might be a little bit a degradation there, so given at that revenue level the range that you mention probably feels a little bit hot, but I would say you're probably in that 35% range plus or minus 100 basis points or so. Now there is a lot of factors in that mix and so on but that's how I would characterize it.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks for the insights there and we've tended to focus on the Gen 5 and the 29-30 and 29-35 upgrade cycles, in some of our most recent reports but obviously you guys are driving new product cycles across their wafer inspection, review document inspection and of course your new radical inspection platform. I'm sure you guys track this but can you give us a view of the mix of your new platform as the percent of your current bookings and maybe some comparison of that some of your prior cycles?","Bren Higgins","The comparison will be tough, I mean I don't really have that data; I mean what we are booking a lot of these new platforms that things to come out in this last year, right. so in even in the more trailing edge businesses like in China, they are buying and the latest Gen of tools, with the ability to try to use that capability as they ramp through this early development of new technology there. So I would say the majority -- pretty solid amount of the business is new products but I don't have the actual percentage.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Steven Chin from UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Chin","Hey guy's thanks for taking my question. Related to the foundry opportunity in China there is an announcement of a ramp of 8-inch and 12-inch capacity earlier this week. I just want to get a sense of -- and sort of price desk on -- looking back last few years I see that the customers sort of mix between four big customers and you may be give us a sense of China foundry customers getting into that category?","Rick Wallace","I guess I'm not sure exactly the question sorry, Stephen, but what\u2026","Steven Chin","I'm just trying to -- like I guess simply how big do you think the China foundry opportunity could be?","Rick Wallace","I see. Well, Bren talked about the percent of our business that we had -- if we look back just to give you an idea of FY16 that finished, China was the second biggest market for us and that was partly because there was some underspending going on but China is pretty significant for KT and I think as we go forward we have the combination of this investment even though it's in -- maybe N minus two technology [ph], we also have a very significant amount of penetration and market share and also this is higher adoption because its foundry. So they are buying some of our newer tools and we see a lot of interest in ramping these facilities quickly, they are spending a lot of money, they are trying to grab markets share, in some cases service the domestic demand; so we feel pretty good about our position there and the fact that there is an area that we're going to invest more heavily going forward as overall to support that China investment cycle. This one is real.","Bren Higgins","But the only thing that I would add is while I think that there are certainly some new development activities happening there as they are ramping these fabs from greenfield state, that ultimately -- its serving a global market and so I think you'll see some movement around in terms of who gets market share but there will be inflexion in the short-term, probably some of it doesn't necessarily contribute to supply but overtime it eventually will. So I think the overall foundry dynamics in the long run will stay pretty consistent but there is certainly a commitment there and there is a focus to Rick's point, not only on the ramping of new technology but also our market position there is very strong.","Steven Chin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Edwin Mok","Great, thanks for taking my question. So I guess first question on the patterning part of your business; I think on the last call you guys talk about increased focus there on patterning -- just call one to see you've implied more commentary around that; is there more focus on metrology and also in terms of financial impact should we expect more R&D spending on that side which ultimately will increase your OpEx?","Rick Wallace","I'll take the first part and then let Bren talk about the second part. We're definitely seeing demand associated with multi-patterning and also EUV. And I'd say the EUV work is in the radical space where we do have tools that are dedicated now to EUV in terms of our 6XX and some of our newest 6XX capability; people are buying for EUV so that's early days of course for that. In terms of overall challenge with customers whether deregistration overly, film thickness or optical CD; all those things are potential areas for drug. We're doing well, we think there is more upside to them and we feel good about our competitive position. Now whether or not we see significant increases in the next 12 months but I think overtime there is potential to keep that business growing. And from an investment standpoint Bren could you talk a little bit about how we thought about that?","Bren Higgins","Yes, I mean we've got a pretty active portfolio management process here in the company and I think given the strategic reorganization that we did a year ago we have the ability to move capital around much more freely than we did in the past so we will continue to execute our process, we've been investing in those businesses, we'll continue to do so. I gave some guidance in the prepared remarks around what I expect OpEx levels to be overall; there is a bit of an increase there and we are trying to drive the focus of that to be mostly R&D with an overall target of trying to 60% or the R&D expenses or the overall OpEx as R&D.","Edwin Mok","Okay, great, that's helpful. And then, I guess just circle back to China or maybe just increase level or investment we see on a trading act [ph]; I think you talked a lot about selling new product and even these customer buying new products but to the extent that they buy older generation products because that's what they need for 28 or higher note. Do you -- should we expect some pricing pressure on that and just because there are more legacy tools?","Rick Wallace","I don't think that's really what we're seeing. I mean right now we do have some ability to flex the different tool capability people need but a lot of these facilities don't think they are going to stay at 28, so there is a desire to have newer capability and of course it doesn't hurt them to have it when they are doing their 28 work but they are hoping that they are going to go obviously lower than that. So I think we're in pretty good shape regardless of where they buy in the portfolio. It's not quite the same; I'll give you a very different example, if you think of some of the investment going on in Internet of Things where people -- maybe an automotive or they are in sensor technology, then we're talking about older tool sets and maybe even some of our KT pro-stuff which is reconfigured or refurbished tools, that's not what we're seeing in our markets in China for the most part, maybe there will be an element of that later but that not what it looks like right now.","Edwin Mok","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.","Jagadish Iyer","Thanks for taking my question, Rick. Two questions; first, what's the termination of the deal with LAN? How much of your effort is focused on putting on the EUV mass inspection, and can you give us some clarity in terms of the line of sight of revenues from this product line as ASML [ph] prepares to ship a dozen tools next year? And then I have a follow-up.","Rick Wallace","So the way we're serving the EUV market is with the 6XXX series that's been out for several years and we have some additional capability to do that. So that's already part of the portfolio and had nothing to do with any discussions we had with our other companies, that's out there and no we're seeing their demand -- some demand for that. I can't really say that at what point that's going to ramp because for a long time it was a part-time application for some customers but we are seeing some dedicated purchase of those tools for that capability and it really will depend on how many starts they have in terms of different types of devices, how many mask they have. But whatever they have with the adequately time we are prepared to serve it; we don't -- it's not really about additional development beyond the capability that we have and some software upgrades and algo upgrades in that platform, we're not talking about a new platform which we talked about several years ago, that's not what we are doing; we're not doing an actinic [ph] inspector, we're developing additional capability on our existing products to serve it.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay, fair enough.","Bren Higgins","Then the only other thing on that is that we would add is that they will do flap-down inspection to qualify radicals, certainly for recall capabilities and incoming quality checks where they will basically print the waiver and do Gen 5 inspections on the waiver to qualify radicals as another checkpoint in terms of making sure radicals are good.","Jagadish Iyer","Okay, fair enough. Then on a big picture question, I just wanted to understand given that there are so many smaller players in the process control segment; what are your thoughts on consolidation post-termination of the deal with Lam?","Rick Wallace","It's not really an area we're focused on, I mean its possible others might do that but we feel pretty good about the products that we have, the range that we have and our ability to satisfy the markets with our organic efforts in terms of process control. So it's not really something we're looking at.","Jagadish Iyer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Patrick Ho","Thank you very much. Rick, first in terms of some of your comments about memory and inspection, given the transitions that are going on, particularly in the 3D NAND front, the capital intensity from metrology [ph] has obviously increased and it makes sense for your overlay data film and even OCD metrology business. What's been some of the key drivers that have gotten at least some Gen 5 evaluations in that marketplace where traditionally they haven't used as much inspection?","Rick Wallace","I think just the fact that there -- as customers are looking at the newer technology notes. First of all, there are more customers trying to get into production; second of all, as those that are in-production are looking to new capability; just the ability to have a better sense of debugging the process in terms of -- from the discovery phase, not really from in-production, so it's really that. And in terms of their ability to see things they've never seen before because if they had EVM Solution, they could find small defects but they couldn't get away for signature, and now they can do both, they can find small defects and get way for level signature.","Patrick Ho","Great. And Bren on the supply chain side of things, you guys have performed really well over the last year in terms of seeing the increases and booking and shipments and trying to surround very quickly; can you just give a little bit of color what some of the tactics and I guess efforts you've made that have had the quick turnaround you've had on the -- in terms of the shipment from bookings?","Bren Higgins","Yes, the NPI process at KLA which is new product introduction where engineering is headed off to manufacturing; on a lot of the new platform transitions that we've had has been really exceptional so tools are being handed over to operations, we have good design stability, our marketing and sales teams are managing the transitions well with customers; so we are not getting stuck necessarily with a lot of the extra inventories, we move customers from one platform to the next. Because of the design stability you don't have retrofit programs and other things; we are out there trying to fix tools as you're shipping them out. So it's been a huge factor I think -- not only in the conversation but also been a factor in the margin profile; A) because of the inventory issues but also the fact that the service cost around the warranty cost to support the tools and get them installed quickly has been fairly efficient, and so that's been a factor as well.","So very impressed with the teams been able to do this and do this in a period of time where there was a lot of work around integration planning distraction and so on, so really impressed at work.","Rick Wallace","I think the one other thing is, as we've taken more risk in terms of inventory risk so one of things we've done is provided more flexibility in the master schedule to be able to react to market demands, especially most of our customers now have a very short visibility into their cycle so we're trying to be prepared so that we don't get caught out not having capacity when it's needed.","Patrick Ho","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Atif Malik","Hi, thanks for taking my question, good job on the quarter. Rick, can you talk about the yields that you guys are seeing on 3D NAND over the last New Year or so? Is that going to be on 3D NAND and the bunch of folders; I'm just curious where you think the yields are broadly speaking on 3D NAND? Will you cover [ph] on 3D NAND different from other devices and logic and [indiscernible]?","Rick Wallace","Yes, obviously given the relative small number of players, I'm going to be careful about this. I would say that the leaders feel good about where they are and I won't comment to that. There are other players getting in the market and I would say that we are seeing success but it is -- if you think about a yield curve, I think that there is a long flat part of that curve down around zero, and I think it took a while for people to debug the process. And frankly, one of the things -- one of the areas for opportunity for us going forward is there is not a really good defect discovery mode for 3D NAND because there is really no tool capable of helping debug; and even although we've made some attempts, when you do find the defects, they are very hard to verify because you have to essentially reprocess or flip them to go find it.","So I'd say it's been slow in terms of getting started; now it's getting better. I think that there is -- some people are getting their process but as they look at expanding to the next technical challenges we anticipate yield is going to be a big part of the challenge and I think there is a lot of interest in partnering with us to come up with solutions to address that because obviously there is demand there but they are certainly getting very challenged by making the processes actually work.","Atif Malik","Okay. And then on the foundry side, we've heard from Lam Research yesterday that they did expectation for next year foundry investments are going to clap to down and then they talked about maybe little bit of digestion [ph] and tend not to be driven. And you're expecting to actually get drove in the first half of '17, is your optimism based on the success of your new products or are you assuming the investments at foundries will kind of sustain at the level we are putting this year?","Bren Higgins","I think -- so Atif, this is Bren. I don't think our general view on the year is much different. I think there could be some growth in foundries as we build it bottoms up but we think it will see continued momentum around and my comments were order, so you'll start to see those tools ship in the second half of the year that will also will see stronger foundry shipments in revenue in the second half related to 7 nanometer activity. But I don't know what -- how they make up their forecast but at the end of the day, I -- as I said, I feel like we're not that far apart and generally in terms of how we look at it and how we look at the year overall.","Atif Malik","So Bren, just to be clear do you expect orders in first half of calendar '17 to be higher than the second half of '16?","Bren Higgins","Yes, I do, both for overall and within foundry.","Atif Malik","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Alice [ph] from B.Riley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. I'll start with one that's pretty high level; it's very nice to hear the confident tone on what can happen in the first half of calendar '17. So the question is, relative to a year ago or little bit more when you were last providing quarterly updates, has the visibility on the business improved? And if it has, to what extent is that improvement due to industry dynamics versus company specific, potentially product cycle dynamics that apply for KLA?","Bren Higgins","I don't think it's really changed all that much, I mean to Rick's point earlier, I think we've tried to be as flexible as we can; we've taken some risks, I think we're managing through transitions and any time we have product transitions to bring a new product with new capabilities of the market, there is a level of customer demand that goes with that. So I guess in one way on anytime you have a transition, you do see some increase in visibility but we are still reacting to -- our customers are facing short lead times with their customers and trying to expect us to follow suit with that and we're doing all we can to try to be as flexible as we can to meet their needs.","One other thing now that is, there is a little different is, the strength out of China is pretty different and there are Greenfield's that are happening, there is big investment plan. So if you think about that part of our business, there is a much more committed and maybe that could change but they are more committed than it was hard to see in the past.","Unidentified Analyst","That makes sense. The follow-up is a question on products in next year's outlook, so in the year where the business has potential to grow 5% to 7% in line with the target model, the product like Gen 5 can double next year as I think I heard previously -- what would some of the other products be that would be viewing some of that company specific growth in a year with a rising top line?","Bren Higgins","Well, you know our 5% to 7% are through cycle multi-year target, right and that was -- when we put that together and say, look from calendar '15 and as we're sizing around the business, we're going to position it so we can deliver that level of revenue growth and try to have operating leverage that's 2X the growth rate. I mean certainly Gen 5 is a bigger piece but there will be some mix and matching that will happen within broadband plasma. So I think it's really -- the strength is, I don't see a fundamental shift in overall mix as we move into next year. To Rick point earlier, there could be more investment in radical inspection as customers begin to prepare for more development activities around EUV. So that could be an inflecting product a little bit into the year; year to year, but overall I think the mix looks relatively consistent across the different product segments.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sidney Ho","Thanks for taking my question. My first question is, have you looked at your annualized revenue for your December quarter, you get to somewhere around $3.3 billion. Sorry, if the question has been asked before but if you look at the operating model that you guys put out, you guys should be somewhere around 59% in gross margin. I'm curious if you think this is kind of permanent step up in gross margin forecast while they are some of the factors that's driving the upside in your near-term?","Bren Higgins","Yes Sidney, we got that question earlier but just to go over it again really quickly, yes, there is -- we've clearly been outperforming the model, I think some of that is due to some of the maturity of the platforms that are out there, we're transitioning some new platforms and so I think will lose some of those tailwinds we've had but to the point I made earlier, I think we're operating probably a 100 basis points or more over that model and so as you play that through, I think you will see the same kind of performance in the operating margin line.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. Sorry for asking the same question. My follow-up question is, let's go back to Gen 5 product, it sounds like you guys don't expect Gen 5 to be cannibalizing Gen 4 until EUV is in production, so that would be put you in 2018 to 2020 timeframe. But if you go back to when Gen 4 was in R&D mode per say, is that roughly the same kind of timeframe? The same number of tools that you used for R&D before they go to -- they go into production?","Rick Wallace","Yes, here is the big difference is. There is no real scaling going on right now. I mean and tell you here EUV, essentially with the multi-patterning, you're not really doing anything relative to defect size, so Gen 4 from a lot of customer's perspective serves that market. So it's really -- people want more sensitivity but it's more about discovery. Frankly, if add the deal with those same defects on the earlier nodes on the current nodes, they wouldn't be able to be in large-scale production. So it really has hinged on when you see advanced technologies going into production on EUV.","Sidney Ho","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I'd turn the call back over to you.","Ed Lockwood","Okay, thank you Christine, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We remind you an audio reply of today's call will be available on our website later on this afternoon. We appreciate your interest in KLA. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
