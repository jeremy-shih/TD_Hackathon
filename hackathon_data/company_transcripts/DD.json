My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.","Greg Friedman","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's first quarter 2015 performance. Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President who is joining for the Q&A portion of the call. The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to Slide 1 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although, they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions.","We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release in today's slides posted on our website.","For today's agenda, Ellen will speak briefly about our results for the quarter and the execution of our strategy to create higher growth and higher value. Nick will review our first quarter financial performance as well as our 2015 outlook. I will provide business segment insights, and Ellen will speak again with concluding remarks followed by your questions.","Before turning over the call to Ellen, I would like to briefly address DuPont's upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As DuPont, we have a best-in-class Board of Directors that\u2019s overseeing management\u2019s plan to transform our company to continue to deliver superior value for all shareholders.","We look forward to ongoing discussion and engagement with our shareholders as we approach the annual meeting. Please note that the subject of today\u2019s call is the company\u2019s first quarter earnings.","With that introduction, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen Kullman","Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. 2015 is an important year in DuPont\u2019s ongoing transformation and our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to grow next generation DuPont even in a challenging marketing environment. In the next few months, we will complete the most significant steps in our ongoing transformation, the separation of Chemours.","We can already see the evidence of the company we will be in the sales and operating earnings growth from our ongoing business over the past several years. We expect to continue this growth trend as we build and leverage our leading positions in large attractive markets for our competitive advantages meet significant opportunities.","In this quarter, we delivered operating earnings of $1.34 per share, currency markets significantly impacted the quarter resulting in a $0.27 headwind. $0.25 was due to currency and $0.02 from net exchange losses.","I'm pleased to report that we delivered volume and margin improvement in the majority of our post-spin segments. Our intent focus on innovation, disciplined execution and ongoing cost reduction delivered and will continue going forward. Our performance was driven by volume and margin gains in our Performance Materials, Safety and Protection, Nutrition and Health, and Industrial Biosciences segments.","Each benefited from new products and applications, tailored to market demand. Even in Agriculture which faced industry-wide challenges we benefited from pricing gains overall on improved mix of products. At the ag markets eventually improved we expect to be well positioned, based on our strong pipeline of seeds and crop protection products including DP4114 and Leptra for insect protection and Lumigen seed treatment.","Performance Materials and Safety and Protection were standout this quarter, delivering significant gains and volumes and margins by staying close to their customers and delivering value-added innovations. In our protection technologies business for example, strong demand for our Kevlar, Nomex, and Tyvek products yielded volume growth that more than offset the impact from currency while improving margins. Our Performance Polymers Business had solid performance driven by volume growth in North America and Asia-Pacific was more than offset softness in Latin America and Europe. Innovation coupled with disciplined attention to cost drives earnings and margins.","And at DuPont, cost reduction remains a top priority. We continue to increase productivity and efficiency through our redesign initiative. At the same time we introduced more than 600 new products in the first quarter, a 5% increase from the first quarter of 2014. We also announced that we would be increasing our dividend for the second quarter by 4%, our fourth increase since the beginning of 2012. Nick, will you a bit about that after he walks through the specifics of the financial details combine these results and Greg will then take us through the segments. Then I\u2019ll be back to discuss our outlook for this year, the important progress we\u2019ve made on our strategic plan and how we will continue to deliver higher growth and higher value now and in the future. Nick?","Nick Fanandakis","Thanks, Ellen. Let\u2019s start with the details of the first quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings per share were $34 verus a $58 in the prior year. As Ellen noted operating EPS included a $0.27 headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar, $0.25 due to currency and $0.02 from net exchange losses. Our results reflect our focus on disciplined execution, innovation and ongoing cost reduction in a dynamic environment, including a stronger dollar in challenging ag and TiO2 markets.","Consolidated net sales were $9.2 billion, a decline of 9% versus the prior year with six percentage points of that decline due to currency as the dollar continue to strengthen against most of our currencies particularly the Euro, Brazilian Real, and the Japanese Yen. Prior year portfolio actions reduce sales by 2% in the quarter. Well, overall volume declined 1% during the quarter. We delivered volume growth in most of our post-spin segments led by performance materials and safety and protection which grew volumes 8% and 6% respectively. Performance materials volume growth was driven by demand in the automotive sector in North America and China and growth in industrial and consumer markets. Safety and protection volume growth was driven by increased demand in global industrial markets and continued strong public sector demand in Europe.","Nutrition and Health and Industrial Biosciences also grew volume by 2% and 1% respectively. Volume decline of 5% in agriculture was due to expected reductions in global corn planted area, lower insecticide demand in Latin America and timing of seed shipments. Electronics and communications, sorry 3% decline, as strong growth in consumer electronics was more than offset by the impact of competitive pressures on Solamet paste.","Turning now to Slide 3, currency was and is expected to be a significant headwind in 2015. Operating earnings were negatively impacted by $0.25 which is included in segment results. Exchange gains and losses was a $0.09 headwind in the quarter, $0.02 higher than the prior year. Additionally, although not reflected in operating earnings, we\u2019ve recognized a $0.04 per share charge in connection with Ukraine devaluation. A higher base income tax rate due to our geographical mix of earnings negatively impacted operating EPS by $0.03 in the quarter.","Our base tax rate for the quarter was about 22% approximately two points higher than the prior year. The segment results including the $0.25 negative impact from currency as I described earlier were down as strong growth in performance materials and safety and protection were more than offset by the challenging ag and TiO2 markets. Corporate and interest expenses provided a benefit of $0.05 in the quarter, which includes the impact of our operational redesign initiative. In addition, a lower share count contributed a $0.02 benefit in the quarter.","Turning now to Slide 4, I would like to highlight some of our geographic results. As you can see our geographical mix of sales shifted year-over-year to a higher percentage of our reported sales occurring in the U.S. and Canada. Excluding the impact of currency, the geographic mix would have been very similar to prior year.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. As you can see earnings growth and performance materials, electronics and communications and safety and protection was more than offset by lower results in ag and performance chemicals. The growth in performance materials is driven by demand for ethylene and performance polymers, which more than offset the impact of currency. Electronics and communications results were driven by increased demand in consumer electronics and continued productivity gains partially offset by the impact of lower metals pricing and currency.","Safety and protection results increased as higher volumes and continued productivity were partially offset by negative currency. Higher cost associated with an outage at Chambers Works facility were largely offset by benefit in connection with the advancement of an ongoing claim. Greg will provide further detail on segment performance later in this call.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. We maintain our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Negative free cash flow of $2.7 billion reflects our typical seasonal agricultural cash outflow in the quarter and was slightly better than the prior year. Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2014 balance, which reflects our normal seasonal shifts. We used existing cash balances to fund our seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, growth investments and dividends.","Today, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a second quarter dividend of $0.49 per share, which represents a 4% increase over the $0.47 paid last quarter. This represents our fourth dividend increase since the beginning of 2012.","On Slide 7, I\u2019d like to highlight that we\u2019re continuing to execute on our operational redesign initiative, which delivered about $0.10 of benefit in the first quarter. For the full year, we now expect to deliver about $0.40 of savings as a result of this program. This represents a $0.05 per share increase versus our January estimate. We remained laser focused on productivity and continue to look for additional areas to improve and accelerate our cost reduction programs. The spin-off of Chemours remains on track for completion on July 1 pending final DuPont board approval.","As we noted in our January earnings news release, we intend to return all or substantially all of the estimated $4 billion of one-time proceeds back to shareholders via a share repurchased within 12 months to 18 months of the separation, with a portion return by the end of this year.","As we previously communicated, Chemours capital structure and separation is expected to support a quarterly dividend to shareholders such as the some of DuPont\u2019s and Chemours aggregate third quarter dividend is equivalent to DuPont\u2019s aggregate quarterly dividend, immediately prior to the separation.","Chemours expected to clear a quarterly dividend in the amount of $100 million for the third quarter 2015. This amount is expected to be paid to shareholders as of a record date following separation. We will provide further updates as this information becomes available.","Looking ahead, for the remainder of the year the global currency markets have continued to be volatile, will further strengthening the dollar against a broad basket of currencies that we operate in versus our January estimate. As a result, we now expect an $0.80 per share headwind from currency for the full year 2015 based on last weeks rate assumptions. Increased from the $0.60 per share headwind previously communicated in our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. We are working aggressively to mitigate the stronger currency headwinds by accelerating cost savings from the operational redesign and other corporate in business actions.","Given this additional $0.20 of currency headwind we now expect to be at the low-end of our previously communicated range of $4 to $4.20 operating earnings per share for the full year 2015. This includes the full year outlook for the Performance Chemical segment.","We expect results to be driven by our underlying sales momentum from the ramp up of our recent product launches like Caesar pure insecticides new product application in Kevlar and new product introductions like our next generation Solamet paste. In the full year benefit of accelerated cost reductions through our redesign initiatives. We are confident in our ability to execute our plans and deliver growth even in a dynamic market environment.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg to review the segments.","Greg Friedman","I would now like to provide some brief segment insights focused on our first quarter results and second quarter segment outlooks. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center website, under events and presentations along with the other materials for today\u2019s call.","Starting with Slide 8, in performance materials we delivered strong volume growth in the quarter which help to offset the impact from currency and lower ethylene prices. Segment volumes increased 8% on solid North America and Asia demand in auto and increased ethylene sales.","Operating earnings increased 12% at higher volumes and a stronger mix overcame the negative impacts from currency and portfolio changes. Operating margins increased approximately 400 basis points primarily due to mix enrichment. For the second quarter, we anticipate sales will be low teens percent lower due primarily to portfolio changes, currency and lower ethylene prices. Excluding these items sales would be up in the low single digit range. Operating earnings are expected to be up in the mid-single digits percent on higher volume and continued mix enrichment.","In our electronics and communications on Slide 9. Operating earnings improved 13% on the stronger product mix and from productivity actions. Sales were 10% lower with continued growth in consumer electronics which were more than offset by the impact of competitive pressures on sales of Solamet paste and the negative impact of lower metals pricing and currency.","We believe our competitive position in PV paste is stabilizing and expect to launch the first in our series of new Solamet paste products in the second quarter with additional introductions later in 2015. We expect continued solid demand for our materials into consumer electronics. Second quarter sales are forecast to be down low-teens percent due to the negative impact of metals pricing, currency and from lower Solamet paste sales. Second quarter operating earning are expected to be down low single-digits percent as productivity will partially offset the impact of lower sales versus the strong prior year quarter.","Moving to Slide 10, safety and protection delivered solid improvements in volume, operating margins and operating earnings. Sales were down 4% as 6% volume growth was more than offset by the negative impact of currency as well as some target divestiture. Volume growth was broad-based in global industrial market including demand for Tyvek protective material, Kevlar high strength materials and Nomex thermal resistant fiber driven by sales into the mechanical, military, medical packaging and chemical markets.","First quarter segment operating earnings up $184 million, were up 5% on volume growth and productivity improvements. Higher cost associated with lower plant utilization at the Chambers Works facility were largely offset by a benefit in connection with the advancement of an ongoing client. In addition the segment improved operating margins by a 170 basis points year-over-year. In the second quarter, we expect sales will be down in the mid-single digit percent range as volume growth will be more than offset by the impact of currency and portfolio changes. Operating earnings growth will be in the mid-single digit percent range, due to continued demand for our products, ongoing innovation and continued operational productivity.","Slide 11, in Industrial Biosciences, we continue to deliver solid results as volume and operating margins improved despite the challenging environment. Sales were 5% lower as 5% higher bioactive volumes and more than offset by the impact of currency. Volumes growth and enzymes was driven by food market demand partially offset by lower biomaterial sales in the U.S. market. Operating earnings at $56 million or even with prior year overcoming the negative impact of currency. Operating margins continue to improve with a 100 basis point increase versus the prior year and 540 basis point increased in total versus the first quarter of 2013.","We expect higher volume to continue in the second quarter driven by benefits from new product offerings and bioactives and increasing penetration into emerging market. These stronger volumes will offset the negative impact of currency and softer U.S. biomaterial volumes resulting in sales and operating earnings results above flat with the prior year.","In Nutrition and Health on Slide 12, the business produced volume and operating margin improvement this quarter. Sales were 6% lower as a 2% increased due to volume was offset by an 8% negative impact on currency. We generated strong volume growth in probiotics cultures, texturants and ingredient systems partially offset by lower volume in the specialty protein market in North America. Volume growth was strong in EMEA the slight pressures from the Russia food import ban offsetting weakness in Latin America. Operating earnings decreased $4 million as volume gains and improved mix were more than offset by the negative impact of currency.","In the second quarter, we expect continued volume growth in those product lines and the specialty protein markets remain very competitive. Sales are expected to be high-single digits percent lower due to continued strong currency headwinds. Operating earnings are expected to be low-teens percent lower primarily due to the negative impact of currency. ","In agriculture on Slide 13, the business performed well given the overall difficult market conditions in the industry. First quarter results were slightly better than expected in January primarily due to disciplined cost actions. 2015 is playing out to be one of the most competitive seasons in recent years given the challenging economic environment in the ag sector and with seed suppliers having abundant inventories globally.","Lower insect pressure in Brazil and continued elevated distributed inventories in the Americas are presenting headwinds in crop protection markets. First quarter Agriculture segment sales were $3.9 billion, down 10%, as 3% higher local prices were offset by 8% negative impact from currency and 5% lower volumes.","We were able to capture 3% higher prices across the segment, driven by an improved mix of Pioneer\u2019s newest corn hybrids and soybean varieties and pricing actions in parts of Europe and Asia, partially offsetting the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","Volume declined 5% due to lower corn planted area, lower insecticide volumes in Latin America and earlier timing of seed shipments. The largest headwind to volume we continue to face is a further shift from corn to soybeans. We have seen growers in Brazil reduce corn plantings in the past summer and Safrinha seasons and our North America seed order book confirms the continued shift to soybeans away from corn.","First quarter operating earnings were significantly impacted by currency and declined 21% as lower sales were partially offset by productivity improvements and disciplined cost actions taken in response to the current market environment in agriculture.","Even in this difficult environment, we continue to perform and execute on the variables that are within our control \u2013 including bringing new products to market that meet customer demand. We are seeing a positive impact from mix on price as growers demand our newest corn and soybean genetics. And we continue to build our robust pipeline, with growth prospects in near-term from new corn and soybean genetics and technologies like event DP4114 and Leptra for insect control.","For the first half of 2015, which reflects the majority of the Northern Hemisphere season, we now expect Agriculture segment sales to be high-single digits percent lower with operating earnings low to mid-teens percent below 2014 as local pricing gains and cost reductions will be offset by currency and lower corn seed and insecticide volumes.","On Slide 14, in Performance Chemicals sales were down 14% due to lower volume in prices combined with the negative impact of currency and portfolio changes. Challenging industry fundamentals continued in the first quarter as TiO2 volumes were down 12% and price down 7%. On a sequential basis price was down 5%. Price pressures in the quarter were driven in part by lower than optimal industry utilization rates, and stronger regional competition.","In Chemicals and Fluoroproducts volumes were even with the prior year as higher demand for fluoropolymers was offset by lower sales of fluorochemicals, principally due to the reduction in R-22 production allocations. Demand for our next generation refrigerant, Opteon 1234yf was up 30% on continued adoption by automotive OEMs.","Operating earnings were down 37% driven primarily by lower TiO2 prices and volumes, the negative impacts of currency, and the impact of portfolio changes. For the second quarter, we anticipate sales and operating earnings will be flat versus the prior year, with currency anticipated to remain a significant headwind year-over-year.","Segment volumes are expected to improve sequentially versus the first quarter due to increased seasonal demand for refrigerants and TiO2. Demand for fluoropolymers and chemicals is also expected to improve.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ellen.","Ellen Kullman","Thanks, Greg. 2015 is a pivotal year for DuPont to the upcoming separation of Chemours as the most significant and visible step in our ongoing transformation to a higher growth, higher value company.","The vision of our strategy is reflected in 19% compound annual growth rate of adjusted operating earnings from 2008 to 2014. From our post-spin business, that comprised the next generation DuPont. This new portfolio will continue to build momentum as we leverage our leading positions in three strategic focused areas where we have robust opportunities and strong well established competitive advantages where our science and engineering capabilities can deliver the greatest value for our shareholders.","The next generation DuPont will continue to drive the productivity of our exceptional science and innovation platform to deliver value-added products and solutions. We will take advantage of our global scale and market insights to continue to develop the right products for the right markets and deliver them efficiently.","Cost disciplined and productivity will continue to be a top priority and with this important transition through our operational redesign we are building a more agile organization that is truly purposed built and scaled for the next generation DuPont. We are investing in modernizing and upgrading a number of our systems to enhance speed-to-market, transaction times, speed and quality of decision making to drive greater performance on a smaller cost base. The disciplined effort we\u2019re applying now is preparing the organization for the next step changing growth and value at DuPont. By the end of 2015, we expect to have annual run rate savings of approximately $1 billion. And at least $1.3 billion in total expected savings by the end of 2017. As we advance this permit change we will deliver more opportunities that improve productivity.","The combined force of our science and market insight, applications expertise in global scale, it evident in each of our businesses and forms the foundation of our continued success. While agricultural markets may continue to face challenges in the near-term. We remain confident in the long-term fundamentals for grain and oil seed demand in our growth strategy in the continued benefits of our successful research investments and new product launches. These broad strengths enabled us to grow sales at a 10% rate from 2008 to 2014 outperforming each of our leading competitors.","We believe the best validation of the strength of our innovation happens in the market. Our success is reflected by the fact that we increased North American corn share by 6 points and soybeans by 9 points from 2008 to 2014. And farmers planted optimum AQUAmax seeds on over 10% of all U.S. corn acres in 2014. As we look ahead an exciting pipeline of new products like DP4114 and Leptra gives us confidence in the future and our opportunities for growth. With 4114 we saw strong efficacy in yield performance in the research trial play at summer.","And we are aggressively integrating this trade into the highest performing Pioneer\u2019s genetics as we prepare for an accelerated product introduction and volume ramp up. This year corn hybrids containing 4114 will be tested in our impact trials which at the final stage of product testing before commercialization.","In 2016, we expect to include 4114 in expanded on-farm grower trials under stewardship while we are wait final regulatory approvals. In Brazil, we look forward to customer demonstrations of Leptra hybrids in the summer of 2015 and a commercial launch for the 2015, 2016 Safrinha season, as we await final regulatory approvals. We expect Leptra hybrids will provide enhanced value proposition for growers in Brazil to help to manage lepidopteran pests including fall armyworm and maximize the yield potential of Pioneer genetics.","We believe that Leptra will help us strengthen our position in the Brazil market as we ramp up volumes in 2016. In crop protection our robust pipeline continues to deliver and we\u2019ve increased the combined target for our novel insect control products Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr to approach $2 billion in peak annual sales. We\u2019re also expanding our Lumigen seed treatment offering such as Dermacor, Lumivia and Lumiderm while preparing to launch [indiscernible] for highly effective disease control and for novel insect control in rice.","As we approach the four-year anniversary of our Danisco acquisition. I want to provide you with the progress report. We\u2019re on track with our initial plan and we\u2019re seeing the tangible benefits of our strategy. Cost synergies have exceeded our original targets and we\u2019re achieved earlier than plant. We\u2019re making solid progress in the market with productivity has demonstrated by the volume and operating margin improvements this quarter and both Nutrition and Health and Industrial Biosciences despite the challenging environment. Nutrition and Health is now reported seventh consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating margin improvement longer term. This acquisition has provided DuPont with world leading industrial biotech capabilities to create transformational new biobased businesses and unlock future growth opportunities.","A Nutrition and Health were combining strong customer relationships with our science and application know-how to create new value. We\u2019re seeing strong growth in key areas such as probiotics and cultures and we\u2019re investing in research and development and global capacity to take advantage of market trends like increasing interest and wellness in the form of our HOWARU Probiotic. We\u2019re also introducing local solutions to collaborations with customers across the globe such as our Yo-Mix starter cultures which meets the needs in a developing world for a nutritious global product that can maintain long life without refrigeration.","In 2014, we delivered strong growth with operating earnings of 27%, expanding margins over 200 basis points. Meanwhile, we are currently at the front end of growth curve in Industrial Biosciences. We have a great business that delivered 25% operating earnings growth and 300 basis points of margin improvement last year. In our core markets which include animal nutrition and food enzymes, home and personal care and grain processing are very strong.","Even as we continue to invest in our core areas and grow our margins, ongoing advancements in science and technology and demand for renewables and sustainability are rapidly expanding the markets for biobased industrials. With our advanced science and technology capability, we are uniquely positioned to innovate in this fast growing area. We\u2019re focused on creating new categories of renewably sourced biobased products such as Silastic ethanol at biologicals and industrial enzymes. One notable example is Tide Coldwater Clean detergent which is the first branded product to use Silastic ethanol as an ingredient in a scalable commercial way.","And advanced materials we are building on our historic strength in application based innovation and delivering on clear routes to growth. During the quarter, our core capabilities in chemistry, polymers engineering and now biosciences enabled us to expand operating margins and increase volumes as we delivered highly tailored value-added solutions for customers.","Strong demand continued from the automotive and aerospace industries for light weight fuel efficient materials like new versions of Kevlar, Nomex, Zytel and Vamac. We continue to penetrate alternative energy and clean technology markets. Also we are meeting the needs for ministration of electronics and the increasing demand for protective materials in industrial, construction and military and first responders.","We are just getting started in other areas of opportunity and are confident that leverage our industrial biotechnology and production agriculture expertise will allow us to capture developing opportunities for sustainably sourced renewable and differentiated polymers. We also expect continued growth for additional innovation such as Solamet paste and Tedlar film to increase the efficiency and lifetime of photovoltaic cells. For the past six years, DuPont supportive management have been active champions of constructive change. Our efforts have delivered results, clearly visible in our 19% compound annual growth rates and adjusted operating earning since year-end 2008 to 2014. Total shareholder return of 266% outperforming the S&P and our peers, and a total return of $14 billion in capital to shareholders. Our discipline capital allocation strategy reflects our commitment to return capital to our shareholders and invest in growth opportunities. We are confident in the future as we look ahead to a year of continued performance and transformation.","We remained focus on delivering higher growth and higher value by investing in and leveraging our innovation platform. Increasing penetration in developing markets and delivering localized solutions. Continually driving lower cost and improving operational efficiency, and actively managing our portfolio all well providing differentiated value-added solutions that customers expect.","In conclusion, our portfolio was well positioned to exceed the pace of longer term, macro-trends driving growth. The world needs to say secure supply of food for growing population and rising middle class. Our capabilities directly address the need for increased productivity in agriculture and enable us to develop new products to address increasing demand for wellness and more nutritionist foods, and our science and application expertise continue to deliver advanced materials that power, fuel and transport, the world sustainably and energy efficiently. Our leading science in powerful innovation platform makes it the partner of choice for companies supplying these markets.","We continue to move forward with disciplined focus and purpose to deliver value now and position DuPont for future success. As we see the momentum of the next generation DuPont, we are energized by the progress we have made, but are even more excited by the opportunities the future holds. Greg?","Greg Friedman","Thanks, Ellen. We will now open the line for questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","Hi, good morning. It looks like Mr. Vergnano has his work cutout for him. I'm curious as to given the declines in Performance Chemicals, the confident that you have and being able to get that $4 billion, midnight dividends. What sort of evaluation metrics went into that figure and, yes, so if you could help us with that that would be great?","Ellen Kullman","Look Frank, thanks for the question. As you know Performance Chemicals is at a cyclical low. We see that there are although headwinds that we\u2019re faced in the first quarter by challenging TiO2 market, capacity utilization in a low 80s, inventory levels of customers largely unchanged. That the fundamentals are stabilizing. And so \u2013 as we look forward, we see not only improvements from seasonal volumes in TiO2 and refrigerants, because they are coming into their season. We have the new products and that point to offer us as stronger pricing environment, in both fluorochemicals and specifically refrigerants and fluoropolymers.","And we do anticipate better results in chemicals and fluoro versus the prior year going forward. Productivity continues to help and we\u2019ll continue to help. So they are at a cyclical bottom. And as we have valued Chemours, we took a look at not only at the cyclical-bottom, but at the range that has been experienced over the last few years.","So Nick, you want to give some specifics?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, Frank so as we looked at the capital structure of Chemours, we dialed in all of the things that Ellen just talked about. We dive in the plan for the expectation of what the EBITDA is going to be for the year. We worked with the rating agencies to have some preliminary evaluations done of the business.","Of course, everything is predicated on that final point of time, but we are so close right now, that I feel very good about the midnight dividend and the debt level that we\u2019re going to be able to place on the entity, along with the dividend structure that we\u2019ve been proposing.","Frank Mitsch","All right, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Thanks very much. You guys gave good help around the sales volume by division what FX has done to the results. Can you give us a sense on an earnings level and outside of peak time is there any meaningful transactional risk from currencies?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, so certainly currency and I took portfolio in the same kind of bucket as we\u2019ve had significant portfolio changes within several of this segments. But if you look at things like N&H, if you took our portfolio in currency their earnings \u2013 operating earnings would have been up 12%. If you take a look at S&P, their operating earnings would have been up 17%, if you look at performance materials up 29%. The headwinds at portfolio in currency were agriculture and were performance chemicals, were they would not have gotten in the positive figures.","I mean its interesting Bob, when you look at back a few years ago, when you take out currency and portfolio with the headwinds we\u2019ve seen in agriculture and the headwinds that we\u2019ve seen in the chemical cycle. Ex-currency we are earned this time last year. And I think that\u2019s a very powerful statement to the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the new DuPont that we\u2019re creating going forward.","Bob Koort","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Ellen, in your comments, you referenced the seed share gains in both corns and soybeans in the last few years into 2015 given the challenging environment, maybe you can grow share or really maintain share of those corns and soybeans?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, so thanks. It\u2019s the little too early to comment on North America share. I can tell you what we\u2019ve been very pleased to adding some mix we\u2019re seeing, we saw in the first quarter. And you can see that with what price has done in agriculture and it\u2019s the stronger mix. I don\u2019t know. Jim, what would you add to that?","Jim Borel","I think it is little too early to try to predict share, but we\u2019re very confident about the competitiveness in corn and soybean products and as well as the services that we\u2019re bringing to growers. In corn, we\u2019re continuing to strengthen our triple stack portfolio and expected to make progress in 2015. So a little too early to predict share, but overall we feel good about our competitors.","David Begleiter","And Ellen, just the Performance Materials volume growth is 8% in the quarter, but actually ethylene sales over the volume growth and what should be underlying volume growth in that segment this year do you think?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, so obviously, ethylene was a benefit in the quarter. I think if you take that out, I think their volumes would have been up 3% to 4% in the balance of those businesses benefitting from stronger automotive in United States and Asia, certainly Europe and Latin America won\u2019t any help in the automative market. But I mean I think the important part there is looks really seeing the benefits from the application development, the innovation centers that we put in a few years ago and the real benefits we\u2019re seeing at the customer in the polymers and not only the performance polymers, but also in the Packaging and Industrial Polymer series.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John McNulty","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe a follow-up on the Chemours platform. Nick, I think you said, you got comfortable with the ability to dividend the $4 billion out because you kind of reviewed or you\u2019re thinking about where the EBITDA goes. Can you give us an update as to what your EBITDA forecast is for that platform as you are looking at 2015?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, that hasn\u2019t gone public yet we work with the rating agencies around that plan, but we\u2019ve not gone public with the numbers on that and that won't be public until they go for the debt offering.","John McNulty","Okay, maybe then just as a follow-up on a different angle, speaking to the ag business when we look at the obviously you had some headwinds there. But when you look at the decremental margins they were \u2013 they are pretty significant or maybe you can walk us through some of the issues there, especially considering that you are getting some pricing that was noted in the early remarks.","Ellen Kullman","As you know, currency is the huge headwind for us in agriculture. Jim, why don\u2019t you take us through this?","Jim Borel","Yes, I think \u2013 for certain currency and the other thing is volume based on corn acre, planted acre declines that are expected and we also saw insecticide volumes down based on the lower pressure of [indiscernible] inBrazil versus a year ago and so, mix had a negative impact \u2013 slightly negative impact on margin in addition to the currency and volume, thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Just two part question on the Chemours spin, first on the dividend you took it up to $0.49 with the $100 million to be paid out by Chemours, is there any opportunity to maintain that $0.49 or should we expected to revert to something like $0.46 or $0.47 equilibrating for that $100 million. And second on the repurchase side, Nick, can you do an ASR to bring forward shrinkage of the share count or should we expect execution pretty ratably over the 12 to 18 months. Thank you.","Ellen Kullman","Yes, I think that we\u2019ve been clear relative to the dividends that the combined dividend of Chemours and DuPont would equal the dividend, DuPont have just prior to the spin. The Chemours dividend is their third quarter dividend. And I think that you can do the math going forward as what that would mean. Nick?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, and so as far as the returning of the midnight dividend back to the shareholders through share buyback what we stated is over the 12 to 18 months Kevin, we\u2019re going to look to see exactly what tool and mechanism we used to secure that \u2013 complete that share buyback. This potential for an ASR, there is also potential for open market. But it will be over that period of 12 to 18 months timeframe.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","DonCarson","Thank you. Question on ag. You given us the first half outlook download of earnings. But what\u2019s your outlook for the second half given how important Brazil is and then you also talk about 2015 being on our competitive seasons in [indiscernible]. What\u2019s your view on the normalized growth and in margin potential of ag as we get into \u201820?","EllenKullman","Jim?","JimBorel","First of all Don. I think the \u2013 longer term picture, as you go forward in ag, we still feel very confident. Number one, that the fundamentals are under the markets remain strong, growing population in the mineral resources et cetera that expect for more science that we can deliver and also our pipeline in both seed and chemistry continues to be very strong.","So we remain confident about our long-term trajectory. In terms of second half, obviously Brazil is going to the real, hard to predict exactly, but we\u2019re assuming that, that\u2019s going to continue to be a negative heard. Probably too early to call the Latin America planting expectations, but obviously we\u2019ll be watching that as we come out of energy U.S. gets planted and the markets starts to adjust to expectations there.","DonCarson","And just a follow-up. So what\u2019s you current topline in margin for trend outlook?","EllenKullman","Sorry, you really hard to hear Don. Let me see if I got it. Say you\u2019re looking for the trend outline on both topline and bottom line for ag for the next two years?","DonCarson","Correct.","EllenKullman","Now, I got the question.","DonCarson","Yes.","EllenKullman","Well, yes, that\u2019s \u2013 Jim, how about you answer that?","JimBorel","Well, I think that the answer is going to depend on how the environment over the next 12 to 18 months plays out. And so as I mentioned earlier longer term \u2013 in the bigger picture we\u2019re still very confident about our trajectory and then the question is going to be what happens with currency and planted acres in some of these crops over the next 12 to 18 months.","EllenKullman","Yes, back to you, and so we are looking to see that should be an improving picture. I think as each quarter goes on we understand exactly where those numbers are coming out to here and in Latin America, it\u2019s going to have the big impact on the recover.","Nick Fanandakis","We\u2019ve got a number of new products that will be continue into move forward in the marketplace and we continue to make sure we are disciplined around our cost as well as during kind of\u2026","EllenKullman","Yes, I think that\u2019s what is \u2013 I think the differentiator is the pipeline. I mean, we take a look at the pipeline both in terms of the crop protection chemicals we talked about. Insecticides and fungicides, in terms of as DP4114 and Leptra in terms of T Series soybeans penetration. So we\u2019ve got a very strong portfolio about seed treatments, et cetera coming in and I think that regard most of the environment, I think we\u2019ve got a strengthening picture for Agricultural segment.","Operator","Our next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citi.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning. Ellen, one of the ways to come that FX to get local pricing, can you talk about segments where you believe you can \u2013 you have the ability to get pricing going forward?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, PJ, so I mean that\u2019s very much depended on the sector and on the competitive nature where our \u2013 for selling in Europe and you have European competitors, so a little harder to get price that it is if you are selling in Europe against U.S. or Asian based competitors. So I mean, I think the interesting thing is that based on the fourth quarter. Our teams have gone out and reinvigorated the pricing analysis down based on the currency change and each individual product line, each individual precedent is driving the appropriate actions for their sector based on that, where we make versus where the competitors make and you can do the math balance if they were that comes out.","So there are opportunities and there are headwinds in that. And I think the most important thing is that our people are on top of it and really driving that. But at the end of the day, our major focus is still on value news, it still on the innovation and as a differentiator and we continue to use that. I mean I think you see that in ag with the positive pricing in a very difficult ag environment where the pipeline and the new products are giving us benefit even when the acres are down. So this is a detail orientation out in the field to really drive the best results.","PJ Juvekar","And just a quick follow-up on your biomaterial, biofuels platform you commented on that. How does that platform compete at today\u2019s oil price? Thank you.","Ellen Kullman","Well, bioactives really aren\u2019t impacted by the price of oil. And that\u2019s where tremendous amount of growth and opportunity are coming from. We see it in the animal nutrition area, we see it in the human nutrition area, we see it in even in ethanol, we\u2019re increases in gasoline are really continuing to drive opportunities there. So bioactives remained strong. Now, in the biomaterial specifically Sorona margins are pressured by oil, because lower feedstock cost for competing carpet fibers. And so you are seeing that in their results and that there are some headwinds associated with that. And Silastic ethanol well, that\u2019s just coming up the plans coming up this quarter and you know we\u2019re just continuing to drive that. So overall the bio-accessory which is really were tremendous amount of opportunity is, there is no headwinds from an oil stand point.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Michael Ritzenthaler","Hi, yes good morning, so within the agriculture obviously encouraging to see higher prices and also the competitive environment become, I\u2019m curious if you could elaborate on how much further a cost action is needed to serve during the operating income in that segment and kind of the nature of those cost actions. And whether growers downshifting at trades in North America and grower profits being more constrained globally influences how you view R&D investments over the next couple of years. And then if there is a way to quantify volume in price X crop protection?","Ellen Kullman","Yes. Let me so \u2013 we\u2019re valuing new seller it is the genetics, it is the capability of our seeds that creates the opportunity for us there. And farmers make the choice of the seed first. But Jim, why don\u2019t you elaborate on this?","Jim Borel","Yes. Well, a number of aspects. So first of all farmers are obviously scrutinizing pretty closely there all of their input purchases. But that said as Ellen said as we deliver more value to the farmer whatever the commodity price that\u2019s reflected in, we can kept the part of that value. So we\u2019re continuing to move forward there you ask about costs we \u2013 if I go back to the fresh start work that we work across corporately obviously the ag businesses where part of that. So we\u2019ve really been working on streamlining the operating model, productivity as a way lives over constantly looking for ways to improve productivity to speed up operations and focus our cost. U.S. that little bit have that might impact R&D investments, I think the way I would describe that is, we\u2019re fully fund in this strategic research projects that are going to drive the pipeline and the future value continue as you normally would making sure that we\u2019re really focused on the most important opportunities. So R&D investment will continue strongly, particularly in the most important projects.","Ellen Kullman","Yes, its hard to see Pioneer spilt those\u2026","Jim Borel","Seed crop protection.","Ellen Kullman","Yes, I\u2019m sorry seep crop protections. Crop protections split you know a crop protections are sales what is impacted Pioneer\u2019s were they get little better from that standpoint, so plus or minus around that decline is Pioneer\u2019s are little above and crops are little below. But lot of that going out to play out the season is not over yet there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity coming through North America and the second quarter again prepared for summer to springing seasons in Brazil. So what time left in this season for this year and we\u2019re really excited about the products and the progress that we are making.","Nick Fanandakis","We have time for one last question.","Operator","Our last question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks, and you kind of just address some of this. So I just want to make sure reconcile with the quadcam inventory levels being elevated in the Americas and you still some of the enthusiastic about Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr so is that those products will continue to grow sales this year, but you might have some headwinds in the balance of the portfolio?","Ellen Kullman","I think that\u2019s correct. It really depend on the pest pressure and as we come through the season so, Jim similar comments.","Jim Borel","Yes, first of all you are right. It will depend on pest pressure, we are positioned very well and we are continuing to expand soyas appear countries around the world, is that most of the launch where we\u2019re starting to move [indiscernible] fungicide forward so crop protections and seed treatments in a number of countries so crop protections pipeline continues to be a really important part of their growth and away from continuing to strengthen margins overtime.","Vincent Andrews","And Jim, do you just have a quick sense of whether your reference that the corn acres in the order book suggest that, farmers are switching to soya do you think it\u2019s more or less of the switch than what sort of this is implied by the USDA forecast.","Jim Borel","Yes, this time in the season its almost possible to say and farmers are really just get in the filed early stages, it\u2019s going to depend on what happens with the weather over the next couple of weeks and what actually goes in the ground. What the final acres will be, so we don\u2019t have any better information than what you heard.","Vincent Andrews","Great.","Nick Fanandakis","Well, thank you everybody for joining the call today. Our team is available for follow-up questions if there are any.","Ellen Kullman","Thank you all.","Jim Borel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

We will not be taking questions on the topic of Trian\u2019s plan or fleet.","With that introduction, I direct you to Slide number 2 and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen Kullman","Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. DuPont made important progress on our strategic plan in 2014 and we\u2019re looking ahead with excitement to a year of continued transformation that will enhance our prospects for the future. Our fourth quarter results reflect our continued focus on execution with volume and margin improvements in almost every segments and operating EPS increasing 20% year-over-year despite market and macro challenges.","We achieved several significant milestones in 2014. These include the ongoing refinement of our portfolio with 10 strategic portfolio actions during the year and our Form 10 filing in December reflecting steady progress towards the mid-year spinoff of Chemours. We initiated a redesigned program last July and already exceeded our second half cost reduction targets, and we continued to act on our commitment to return capital to shareholders through $2 billion of share repurchases and increasing the common stock dividends 4% in July for a total of 3.7 billion returned to shareholders in 2014 alone.","In 2015 DuPont will continue its transformation as a dynamic science company driven by innovation, executions and global reach. Our focus on creating shareholder value and leveraging advanced science and technology, market and value chain knowledge, global scale and disciplined management has delivered 266% total shareholder return and $14 billion of cumulative capital returned to shareholders since our leadership change in 2009. We\u2019re executing on key initiatives that will continue to deliver shareholder value going forward.","Before Nick and Greg take you through the details of our results, I want to highlight two key elements that underscore our commitment to increasing shareholder value. Over the course of this year, you will continue to see a major contribution from our operational redesign. I have more to say about this important program, but I\u2019m also pleased to note that we\u2019ve increased our cost reduction target by approximately $300 million to at least $1.3 billion of total expected savings to be achieved on a run-rate basis by 2017.","We\u2019ve already achieved $0.07 per share in 2014. By the end of 2015, we forecast annual run rate savings of approximately $1 billion, a significant acceleration of our originally announced schedule. This is a top priority for all of us at DuPont, and we\u2019re working with the leading international consulting firm with extensive experience in initiatives of this magnitude. Plans are being tracked with business leaders held accountable for achieving them and you will continue to hear about our quarterly progress.","For more significant strategic action anticipated for 2015 is the separation of Chemours. As part of that separation, DuPont will receive a one-time dividend from Chemours at the time of separation. We expect to return all or substantially all of the proceeds from that dividend back to shareholders within 12 months to 18 months of completing the separation with a portion to be returned by the end of 2015.","Nick will provide more detail about this in his remarks. I\u2019ll be back to give you more perspectives on the year ahead, but now I\u2019ll hand it off to Nick to walk us through on fourth quarter and full year results.","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen. Let's start with the details of the fourth quarter on Slide 3. We delivered $0.71 operating earnings per share versus $0.59 in the prior year. The 20% increase in the fourth quarter reflects gains from strategic portfolio actions, continued productivity and cost reductions related to the Company\u2019s operational redesign initiative, lower performance based compensation expense and share repurchases. The improvement is a direct result of disciplined execution in innovation despite macroeconomic and market headwinds including a weaker ag economy, stronger dollar and a difficult market pricing environment.","Consolidated net sales were $7.4 billion; volume growth of 3% was more than offset by a 4% impact form portfolio and a 3% negative currency impact. The Company continued to execute on its strategy to enhance the value creation of the portfolio finalizing five divestitures in the fourth quarter and 10 portfolio actions for the full year.","While these product line divestitures reduced our revenue by 2% in 2014, they remain the right strategic choices to unlock shareholder value over the long-term, enabling our future growth by allowing us to focus on higher growth opportunities, margin improvements and less cyclicality. From a currency perspective, the dollar continued to strengthen against most currencies particularly the euro, Brazilian real and the Japanese yen.","Currency for the quarter was a $0.07 hit impacting segment results. For the full year, we had a $0.26 per share currency headwind comprised of $0.11 impacting segment results and an after tax exchange loss of $0.15. Volume growth of 3% across most segments was led by agriculture and performance materials which grew volumes 5% and 4% respectively. The agriculture volume increased reflects higher crop protection volumes in the timing of seed shipments.","Performance Materials volume growth was driven by demand in the automotive sector in North America and China and growth in industrial and consumer markets. Volume decline was limited to electronics and communications which saw a 5% decline year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of competitive pressures on Solamet paste. Weaker local pricing of 1% in the quarter was primarily driven by lower pass through metals pricing in electronics and communications, lower corn seed prices in agriculture principally in Brazil and Performance Chemicals.","In 2014, we delivered full year earnings growth despite the headwinds I previously described. We achieved double-digit operating earnings growth in three segments and improved margin year-over-year in five segments. We continued our focus on improving operational productivity and completed the first wave of our enterprise wide redesign, which delivered cost savings of $0.07 per share in the second half.","Although not specifically reflected on the chart, I\u2019d like to comment now on taxes. For the full year our base tax rate was about 19%, two points lower than we anticipated three months ago and more than one point lower than the prior year. The lower rate in 2014 results from favorable geographic mix of earnings and the re-enactment of the U.S. R&D credit in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter base tax rate was about 9% reflecting a favorable year-to-date catch up adjustment and the net impact of these tax law changes.","Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis shown on slide 4. As you can see here the performance in the quarter was driven by higher results in agriculture, performance materials and industrial biosciences partially offset by higher expenses associated with pre-commercial programs incorporated in the other categories in the chart. As noted on the slide segment results included $175 million in lower performance based compensation versus the prior year reflecting the alignment of our compensation practices with performance.","Turning now to Slide 5, I would like to highlight some of our geographic results. Worldwide our sales were down 5% in the quarter as the volume increase of 3% was offset by reductions in portfolio of 4%, currency of 3% and local pricing of 1%. Sales in developing markets decreased 3% during the quarter primarily due to the impact of portfolio changes, currency and lower Latin America sales.","Sales in developing EMEA increased 4% in the quarter versus fourth quarter 2013. Volume increases in most segments led by agriculture, safety and protection and industrial biosciences were partially offset by currency. Volume growth in safety and protection was driven by public sector demand for Kevlar. In Latin America sales declined 10% principally due to 5% negative currency impact, 3% decline from local price and lower seed volumes. Lower price is primarily attributed to lower corn seed pricing in Brazil.","Developing Asia grew 3% in the quarter or 8% higher volumes offset by portfolio and the negative impact of currency. Volume grew in most segments led by performance chemicals and performance materials.","Turning now to Slide 6, you can see that the growth in our operating earnings per share in the quarter is attributable to the combination of higher segment operating earnings, lower corporate and interest expense and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. Portfolio changes in EG&L each had a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings in the quarter.","Segment results contributed $0.09 higher operating earnings in the quarter excluding a $0.03 hit from portfolio changes I described earlier. For the full year segment results contributed $0.11 in operating earnings excluding a $0.09 hit on portfolio changes.","The favorable variance in corporate and interest expenses provided a benefit of $0.07 in the quarter primarily reflecting the impact of our cost cutting program. For the full year lower corporate and interest expenses provided a benefit of $0.11 to operating earnings.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. We ended the year with $1.7 billion of free cash flow on a total company basis versus $1.3 billion last year. The increase primarily reflects the absence of tax payments related to the sale of Performance Coatings. We ended 2014 with net debt of $3.7 billion versus $3.4 billion in December of 2013. Year-end cash balances decreased to about $7 billion. The decrease is primarily due to the completion of our $2 billion share repurchase commitment in 2014.","Let me point out that our unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities increased nearly $4 billion from $8 billion last year to $12 billion now. The increase was driven by the impact of lower discount rate as well as a change in mortality tables that was enacted in late 2014.","On Slide 8, I\u2019d like to highlight that we're continuing to execute on our operational redesign initiative which delivered about $0.05 of benefit in the fourth quarter. For the full year earnings benefited $0.07. As Ellen noted we have increased our original cost reduction target to at least $1.3 billion and I want to underscore that we will continue to look for additional areas of productivity improvements in cost reductions.","The spinoff of the Performance Chemical segment remains on track for the completion in mid 2015. In December 2014 the initial draft of the Form 10 registration statement was filed with the SEC and we announced that the new company named as the Chemours Company is targeting a high yield debt rating of BB. We expect the commensurate debt level to result in approximately $4 billion of one-time dividend proceeds from Chemours to DuPont.","As Ellen stated earlier we intend to return all or substantially all of these proceeds back to shareholders via a share repurchase within 12 to 18 months of separation and with a portion being returned by the end of 2015. However the amount of the dividend received from Chemours depends on the rating agency outcome and the underlying business conditions which may change between now and the time of separation. We will provide more updates as information becomes available.","Turning now to Slide 9, I\u2019d like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2015. These assumptions form the foundation of our 2015 guidance. Broadly speaking, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and will be a substantial headwind for us in 2015. We expect global growth of 3% against the backdrop of world economy that continues to face many uncertainties. We expect global industrial production to increase about 3% in 2015. Growth has strengthened in North America and uncertainty in Japan and Europe continues as industrial production has stalled and Russia and Ukraine remain in recession.","In agriculture the fundamentals are challenging. Farmer net income has declined and we anticipate lower corn planted area as farmers favor soybeans over corn. Auto growth continues while growth in the U.S. housing is expected to accelerate.","With this backdrop let\u2019s now turn to Slide 10. We expect net sales to be even with prior year as about 5% volume and price growth across the company is expected to be offset by the impact of portfolio changes and currency. The company expects 2015 operating earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share which includes full year results for the Performance Chemicals segment. The outlook also includes a $0.60 per share headwind based on last week\u2019s currency rates.","The global currency markets have recently experienced significant volatility and a meaningful strengthening of the dollar against a broad basket of currencies that we operate in. This has created a significant headwind for DuPont\u2019s expected outlook for 2015.","The currency impact is expected to be most significant for us in the first half of the year due to the seasonality and operating earnings from agriculture in the Northern Hemisphere. Headwinds from a weaker euro, lower corn planted area and a difficult market pricing environment in performance chemicals will be strongest in the first quarter and are expected to more than offset growth in other segments.","Excluding currency impacts, we would expect earnings growth to be in line with our long-term targets driven by this underlying sales momentum and a full year benefit of accelerated cost reductions through our redesign efforts.","For the full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 22% an increase from prior year due to geographical mix of earnings and the absence of the U.S. R&D credit. This represents about a $0.15 per share headwind in the outlook. Capital expenditures are expected to be $1.8 billion. In 2015, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings the transaction related cost of the separation of performance chemicals and report them on Schedule B of our earnings report. We anticipate these expenses will be about $0.30 per share for the year compared to $0.14 in 2014.","Our market environment continues to be a dynamic one. We\u2019re cautious as we enter 2015 but confident in our ability to execute our plans while remaining poised to capitalize on changing market conditions and growth opportunities.","With that let me turn the call over to Greg, who\u2019ll review the segments. Greg?","Greg Friedman","I\u2019d now like to provide some brief segment insights focused on our full year 2014 results and the first quarter and full year segment outlook. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the Investor Center Web site under Events & Presentation along with other materials for today\u2019s call.","Starting with Slide 11, in agriculture full year operating earnings decreased 5% as higher crop protection volumes, higher local seed prices and lower costs including seed input were more than offset by lower corn seed volume, a negative impact of currency and portfolio impacts. During the year, we took disciplined actions to streamline our cost structure, further focus our investment on the highest growth opportunities and better position ourselves for the current economic environment.","As we look to the near future, we expect the economic environment in the agriculture sector to remain challenged. Farmer net income has declined and growers in Brazil\u2019s Safrinha season and in North America are likely to reduce corn pricings again in 2015 putting pressure on volumes in the first half of year.","Our seed order book reflects the shift in acres. In addition, lower insect pressure in Brazil and continued elevated distributor inventories in the Americas will present headwinds in 2015 in crop protection markets. Farmers are increasing demand in our newest corn seed genetics, our AcreMax integrated refuge corn products and our new T Series soybean variety. However, with profits coming down, farmers are sharpening their pencils when it comes to input purchases. Coupled with strong industry seed supplies, 2015 continues to be a very dynamic and competitive season.","We anticipate currencies will remain volatile and headwinds to be substantial in markets like Europe, Brazil and Canada where we have seen strong growth in our market position in recent years. For the first half of 2015, which reflects the majority of the Northern Hemisphere season, we expect Agriculture segment sales to be mid-single digits percent lower with operating earnings about 10% below 2014 as price gains from new product mix are more than offset by currency and lower volumes. The currency impact will be greatest in the first quarter when the majority of 2015 season sales in Europe occur.","Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter due to an expected decline in North America and Brazil Safrinha corn area, the earlier timing of Northern Hemisphere seed shipments which benefited the fourth quarter of 2014, and a reduction in herbicide volumes. We expect first quarter sales to be about 10% lower and operating earnings about 25% below 2014. ","For the full year, we expect sales to be down low single-digits percent and operating earnings down high single-digits percent as price gains from new seed and crop protection products are more than offset by currency headwinds. Excluding this impact of currency, we would expect operating earnings to be up mid-to-high single-digits.","While agriculture markets may continue to face challenges in the short-term, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals for sustainable demand growth for grain and oilseeds and in our growth strategy. We are excited about our near-term pipeline of new genetics and traits like DP4114 and Leptra insect protection in seeds. Leptra will bring an additional mode of control to help Brazilian farmers manage the intense pressure they face from insects, including fall armyworm. In crop protection our robust pipeline of new actives will continue to complement our recent launches of insecticides and fungicides and our expanding seed treatment portfolio.","On slide 12, on Performance Materials we delivered another solid year. Full year operating earnings were up 1% overcoming the negative impact of portfolio changes and the 60-day planned ethylene outage. Operating margins increased 70 basis points to close the year at 21%, well above our long-term target. For the first quarter, we anticipate sales will be down in the mid-single-digits percent range due primarily to currency and portfolio impact.","Operating earnings are expected to be up in the mid-teens however on a percentage basis on improved volume as prior year sales were constraint in advance for the scheduled ethylene outage. In 2015, we anticipate strong volumes will be more than offset by the combined negative impact of portfolio price and currency resulting in sales down mid-single-digits. Full year operating earnings are expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range however as higher volumes more than offset the negative impact of currency.","Moving to Slide 13, in Industrial Biosciences we delivered outstanding full year results, higher volumes and improved mix from the continued ramp of new products help deliver a 25% increase in operating earnings and a 300 basis point increase in operating margin. Our volume growth in enzyme was driven by new product offerings and increased sales into emerging geographies in key markets including ethanol, food and animal nutrition. While ethanol industry fundamentals are adjusting to a lower energy cost environment, we anticipate demand for DuPont\u2019s novel enzymes and other functional bio-products designed to increase production rates, yield and efficiency will remain steady for this year.","The first quarter of 2015, we anticipate higher segment volumes will be offset by the negative impacts of currency and lower prices, resulting in sales even with the prior year. First quarter operating earnings are also expected to be even with the prior year. For the full year, we expect sales will be flat but higher volumes and stronger mix will result in earnings up in the high-teens on a percentage basis.","On Slide 14, full year sales in electronics and communications were 6% lower as volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by lower metals prices and by competitive pressure in photovoltaic paste. Full year 2014 operating earnings of $355 million increased $21 million, or 6%, on volume growth and productivity gains, partially offset by the absence of 20 million in OLED licensing income realized in 2013.","Looking ahead to 2015, global photovoltaic module installations are expected to grow about 20% fueled by installations in China, Japan and the U.S. and in developing markets. We expect continued strength in Tedlar film, consumer electronics and packaging graphics. In the short-term, we expect segment results will continue to be negatively impacted by declines in Solamet paste, as intense competition has impacted price and share in this business. We have begun testing a new metalized paste product for the PV market with customers, and expect to ramp up production in 2015.","For the first quarter we expect sales to be down low teens percent from short-term challenges in PV paste and lower metals prices with operating earnings about flat benefiting from productivity. We expect to see the impact of our new photovoltaic paste products in the second half of the year. Full year sales are expected up low-single digits percent from volume gains offset by the pass through of lower metals prices. For the year we expect operating earnings to be up in the high-teens percentage.","On Slide 15, in Nutrition and Health our disciplined focus on productivity and mix enrichment is paying off as operating margins improved over 200 basis points for the full year. 2014 was a strong year for this segment as full year operating earnings grew 27% from an improved product mix, volume growth, productivity and a gain on termination of a distribution agreement partially offset by the negative impact of currency.","Market conditions are expected to remain challenging in Europe where the Russia food import ban continues to have an effect and currency will be a strong headwind. In the first quarter we expect sales and operating earnings to be about flat with broad based volume gains negated by the impact of currency.","Full year sales are expected to be about flat with broad based volume gains offset by currency. Full year operating earnings are expected to be mid-single-digit percent higher benefiting from lower raw material costs, improved mix and a continued focus on productivity further expanding operating margins.","On slide 16, in Safety and Protection we delivered full year 2014 operating earnings of $794 million an increase of $104 million or 15% from higher volumes driven by increased demand Nomex thermal resistant fiber, and Kevlar high strength materials paired with productivity improvements and lower product costs. These gains were partially offset by lower sales from clean technologies offering and portfolio changes.","Operating margins were up 260 basis points versus the prior year. In the first quarter of 2015 we anticipate sales down in the low-single digit percent range and earnings growth in the mid-single digit percent range as volume growth, higher operating margins and sustained operational productivity will be partially offset by the impact of currency and portfolio changes.","For the full year 2015 segment sales are expected to be flat and earnings up in the low-teens on a percent basis as strong volume growth, continued margin improvement and productivity will be offset by portfolio changes in currency.","On slide 17, in Performance Chemicals, full year operating earnings were down 8% primarily due to lower pricing and the negative impact of portfolio and currency. We delivered volume growth across the portfolio but competitive pressures in TiO2 remain high as soft industry fundamental especially in Europe contributed to lower prices during the year. We believe industry utilization rates remain essentially unchanged with inventory levels near normal. In the first quarter of 2015 we anticipate sales will be down in the mid single-digit on a percentage basis and operating earnings will be down about 35% due primarily to lower U.S dollar pricing.","Full year 2015 segment volumes are expected to grow at 1 to 2 times the rate of GDP, portfolio sales up low-single digits on a percentage basis. Full year operating earnings are expected to be about flat as higher volumes are offset by the negative impact of currency and portfolio changes.","Now I will turn the call back over the Ellen.","Ellen Kullman","Thanks Greg. Overall we made strong progress on our strategic plans in 2014; our decisive actions across the company enabled us to deliver volume, margin and earnings growth in the majority of our segments even in an environment of significant market and macroeconomic headwinds. As we look ahead we're focused on strategic choices that will position DuPont for higher growth and higher value.","While we are very focused on cost reductions our transformation goes far beyond that. As you know over the past six years our actions have been guided by a clear plan to dramatically refine the portfolio to focus investments in areas of significant opportunity and secular growth, fueled our innovation platform in good times and bad to deliver substantial revenues from the new product synergies over the prior four years, instituted our focus on efficiency, cost discipline and accountability as a way of life. Expanded our global penetration and demonstrated our commitments to shareholders by returning approximately $14 billion to shareholders.","We consider that over a three year period we will soon have divested of our two largest legacy businesses representing over $11 billion in total sales, you will begin to understand the magnitude of change we're driving. As we step before the spinoff of Chemours is a major inflection point on this path. In preparation for that event last July we launched a sweeping operational redesign with the advice of a leading consulting firm. Through our work we've created a blueprint for the new DuPont and we're making sure that we start out with foundation that aligns a highly effective innovation driven operating and business model with a significantly reduced cost structure.","Our partners have helped us conduct a top down and bottom up analysis. We\u2019re upgrading and modernizing everything from our management reporting structures to our manufacturing supply chain to the way we process transactions. With a more streamlined structure, our investments will be targeted, disciplined and effective enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace. And we will continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce cost and streamline our organization. Just as they\u2019ve been productivity, efficiency and accountability will be a way of life for the new DuPont.","In short, a redesign will help us to continue deliver on our cost and value initiative and drive growth across our three strategic priorities; extending our leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthening and growing our advanced materials capabilities and leveraging across company knowledge to develop a world leading bio-based industrial business. This year our investments will continue to be targeted towards these three priorities.","In agriculture, we\u2019re making strategic investments to extend our leadership in germplasm and breeding, while advancing our exciting biotech and crop protection pipeline to create valuable solutions for farmers. We\u2019re making excellent progress towards the commercialization of Leptra corn hybrids in Brazil, corn event DP4114 and several active ingredients in crop protection. DuPont crop protection recently was awarded three prestigious 2014 Agro Awards including Best R&D Pipeline for the second consecutive year, and we continue to ramp up recent innovations like AcreMax in corn, T series soybeans, Encirca Services, Ti-Pure for insect control and Dermacor seed treatment to name a few.","In specialty food ingredients, we\u2019re focused on expanding our nutritional offerings with high growth emerging health and wellness markets. Products like our successful line of HOWARU Probiotics are designed to meet expanding demand for health enhancing bacteria and food, beverages and dietary supplements.","In advanced materials, our application and product development investments in innovative polymer, electronic and protective materials will help expand the performance boundaries in markets including automotive, aerospace, packaging, photovoltaic and construction.","And in industrial biosciences, we continue to ramp up our new products including cold water, bakery and animal nutrition enzymes to build on our current momentum. As innovation creates new demand for these products, we\u2019re well positioned to create new categories of renewable resource, bio-based materials and fuels that draw on our knowledge from our agriculture and advanced materials business. Our strategic priorities continue to guide us and focus our growth strategy. To deliver we will be relentless in the pursuit of operational excellence with three operating priorities; innovation, global reach and strong execution.","Looking ahead 2015 will build on the solid progress we\u2019ve made in the execution of DuPont strategic plan. Following the separation of Chemours, we will be a very different company. With greater emphasis than ever before on science driven innovation we are facilitating an even closer connection between our laboratories and the marketplace and faster, more effective execution in delivering innovative solutions for our global customers. We\u2019re enhancing our agility and responsiveness to market conditions necessary to win in a globally competitive environment and we\u2019re already starting to see results.","The cultural shift we\u2019re driving started with the global financial crisis and has been reinforced by portfolio changes large and small and the recast of our corporate and functional support. This is enabling us to capture the enormous opportunity ahead and provide a clear understanding of how each of us can contribute in new ways to the DuPont that will emerge post separation.","In summary, DuPont continues to move forward with disciplined focus and purpose to deliver value now and position DuPont for the longer term. Our Board and Management are on course following a plan we began implementing six years ago that has delivered significant value accumulative capital return of $14 billion to shareholders and 266% total shareholder return well ahead of the S&P 500 and our proxy peers. We will continue to pursue the right choices and decisions to build on our historic track record as a dynamic science company delivering value through market driven innovation and a highly efficient low cost structure. And most importantly we remain confident in our plan to deliver sustained long-term value for our shareholders. Greg.","Greg Friedman","Thanks, Ellen. We\u2019ll now open the lines for questions. Also joining us for Q&A is Jim Borel, Executive Vice President. As a reminder, the purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss our operating earnings. We ask that you keep your questions focused on our results and outlook.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Ellen, can you comment on the pace of 4 billion buybacks, why it was 18 months wanted something little bit quicker?","Nick Fanandakis","So, a couple of things I should mention David, I mean first I qualify the $4 billion as I mentioned on the call the value of the midnight dividend will obviously be depended upon once we get in front of the credit rating agencies with the Chemours business outlook at the time. And in order to maintain that BB rating, we\u2019re determined what level of debt we\u2019re really going to be able to put on there. Right now we\u2019re estimating that to be $4 billion.","Now there are some IRS rules that come into play here around the length of time one would have to return that value to the shareholders and has to be done in this 18 month period in order to maintain the tax free status of it. And so we\u2019re projecting somewhere in that 12 to 18 month period is when we would look to return substantially all of that estimated $4 billion to the shareholders.","Ellen Kullman","Yes, David and as we get closer to knowing exactly what the number is and looking at going forward we\u2019ll be more definitive on the timing of that what would occur in \u201815 and what would occur in \u201816.","David Begleiter","And Ellen just on the corporate expenses we\u2019ve seen nice decline in the last couple of years to $700 million in 2014. Where do you expect corporate expense to be in 2015?","Ellen Kullman","So obviously they are going to be lower and obviously with fresh start and we\u2019ve sized that for you, that fresh start hits not only corporate expense it hits the segment expenses and even product costs as we\u2019re doing some things around like warehouses and things like that. So, we continue to drive that very efficiently and we\u2019ve been very proud of the work that we did in the last quarter to identify another $300 million in savings and be able to achieve that savings by the end of \u201817.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch","We\u2019re about six weeks since the Form 10 came out on Chemours, and I know Nick that you had said in the past that would set the base case in terms of a spinout or if there were other avenues of sale or what have you that might be considered, can you talk about the interest that you\u2019ve seen there or how that has been trending and what\u2019s your best guess in terms of does this go spinout or not?","Nick Fanandakis","Well you characterized it right Frank that we said that we\u2019re going to have Form 10 out there to essentially build the box if you will of what would be the base case and how we would proceed. And I\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going at pace to execute against that spin separation. We do remain open to explore opportunities, I am not going to get into specifics in that regard, but we would remain open to explore opportunity. But I\u2019ve also said many times that I find it very difficult to imagine something that\u2019s going to take me of the spin path, I think the value that would have to be there in the way of the upside versus the speed and risk that one would take from going off of this spin path that we\u2019re on, we have to be significant enough but I just find it hard to imagine that, that\u2019s going to be possible Frank.","Frank Mitsch","And if I could follow-up on fresh start, obviously a nice bump in the program here and a nice acceleration in terms of when you realize that I think you said $0.30 to $0.35 would be realized here in 2015 which at that $1 billion run rate suggests $0.50 or so to be realized in 2016 and incremental $0.50 that\u2019s realized in 2016, is there anything that might be deflating that in terms of stranded cost or something like that, that might be an offset to that $0.50 positive from fresh start in 2016?","Nick Fanandakis","It's not going to be stranded cost Frank, but obviously as you go into 2016 there will be inflation that that\u2019s going to occur on some of the cost items. There is also growth efforts that we continue to expand upon and drive. So there is going to be some increases in the cost element that this is going to be going against that sort of an increase. But it's not going to be something like stranded cost that's going to be there that's going to cause any kind of reduction against our projections. ","Our number as you said is we believe we will realize about $0.35 in 2015, and at the end of \u201815 we will be at a run rate of about $1 billion. Now that run rate of $1 billion includes the run rate of $1 billion, includes the amount of cost that would be going over to P Chem part of the separation. The $0.35 does not, that's just $0.35 of value created within DuPont itself without the money going over to P Chem.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","I was looking at the fund flow statement and your change in operating assets and liabilities was the use of $1.3 billion and the previous year was $1.4 billion. What\u2019s behind that change? And ht your receivables and inventories don't really change that much but there is something that's using up cash and do you have a forecast of 2015 for that number?","Ellen Kullman ","Yes, Jeff. So you have a knack for going to a very specific place and Nick has just now told me he has figured it out, so Nick.","Nick Fanandakis ","Jeff I think the biggest thing there is the absence of the tax payment for the coating sale. We had about $700 million of tax payment that shows as part of that free cash flow but the inflow of cash is below the free cash flow line in the investments area. So that's the biggest reason for the delta on a year-over-year basis.","Jeff Zekauskas","And I guess secondly the currency hit of $0.60 seems a lot, I was wondering what it translates to in terms of a change in sales? I mean my guess was that if your consolidated sales decreased 5% from currency but that would be $0.30 not $0.60 are there currency positions that are jeopardized? Is that what makes the number so large or is the sales impact bigger?","Ellen Kullman","Yes. So if you look at it we only have 37% of our revenue last year within the United States. So we have a very large revenue base outside. If you look at the total impact on the revenue lines for 2015, we\u2019re looking now at about 3.5% and then when you translate that down our position and in all of our businesses it does come out $0.60 a share. So it is large, it's obviously why we wanted to get it out there and we\u2019ve seen this coming to the fourth quarter because you saw the currency start to move there but January has been tremendously volatile.","Nick Fanandakis","The other thing I would add to what Ellen said and fully in line with what she just told you Jeff. But the other piece I would add is, think about the timing of all this, those exchange rates may change throughout the year but we're most heavily exposed especially against the euro in that first half of the year with the ag business. So our mix and timing of that mix and when those sales are going to take place is going to have a significant impact on our company.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","I was wondering if you could give me a little more color on the comps that I think you sized it at 175 in the quarter? And it seems you have made your guidance that you had rejiggered mid-year, so is it just a function of you need to wait to the end of the year to true up that expense line? And what were the specific metrics that were failed or ones that resulted in that big comp hit?","Ellen Kullman","We set aggressive performance targets at the beginning of the year for each one of our businesses and for the company. And our results did not meet the aggressive targets that we set this time last year and therefore the performance based compensation is hit accordingly and we threw it up at the end of the year from that standpoint. So I mean it is paper performance the performance based culture we\u2019re driving this company, and I think that's reflective of it.","Bob Koort","And my follow-up on Solamet you mentioned that it\u2019s maybe becoming somewhat commoditized, you have intensified competition; you are going through new product developments. Can you talk about what those new products offer that might get your customers to switch from a deflating product towards something that might cost them more but add some value?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, so obviously with increased competition and in that segment, I mean we've upped our game on the innovation side coming through 2014. There is innovation left in that market space and we have the line on new products that we're testing now in small quantities with our customers that we will be commercializing in 2015. So we still think there is attractive space and we think that innovation still matters. I don't consider it commoditized, I just think that the competition is intensified in terms of creating new performance products and so people have caught up with us and we're going to focus our efforts on pulling ahead again in 2015.","Operator","Our next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citigroup.","Ellen Kullman","PJ you\u2019re on mute.","Operator","I can go to the next question, if you wish.","Ellen Kullman","Yes, that\u2019s great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","A question on your domestic agricultural business. Can you just size the impact for the full year on the shift from corn to soya in the U.S.? And as you move forward in somewhere around Grade 2seed, will you be expensing more of Monsanto royalties? Is that going to be a drag on earnings as well?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, Jim why don\u2019t you take that one?","Jim Borel","Yes so as we look at \u201815 clearly we\u2019re expecting corn acres that the soybean corn price still favors soybean, so we\u2019re expecting corn acres to be down, but it\u2019s very difficult to size and those final decisions are being made by growers closer and closer to the season. So it\u2019s hard to size the shift, but we do expect the decline in corn acres and a slight increase in soybeans. Regarding the royalties, the royalties will be higher as we continue to increase the penetration around a few into the lineup, so that\u2019ll be expensed as those things increase into the portfolio. For example in \u201815 we\u2019d expect around the Grade 2 sales to be about double what they were in \u201814.","Don Carson","But Jim overall so you\u2019re saying a shift from corn to soy is negative for you, you just don\u2019t have the exact amount?","Jim Borel","Yes at this point, the shift to come from corn to soy is negative for us. We are going to make good money on both of them, but corn is a bit more profitable last few years.","Ellen Kullman","And that\u2019s a part of our guidance that we\u2019ve put out for you today, Don.","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just on the Performance Chemicals business and maybe specific to Ti02. I just was trying to reconcile how we get, in 4Q look volume was up price was down both sequentially and year-over-year, and then you\u2019re talking about 1Q profits being down 35% I see there\u2019s a lot of currency in there. But how do we ultimately get the year to be flat with that as the backdrop?","Ellen Kullman","Yes so the first quarter is specifically problematic because of sequential price versus year-over-year price specifically in Ti02. So sequentially if price in the first quarter is about flat, it is down by high single-digits from last year. And that along with flat volume because the first quarter really there isn\u2019t a lot of volume improvements typically kind of results in that kind of earnings profile and you expected the volumes improve throughout the year as specifically also in Chemicals & Fluoroproducts as their volumes -- the season and refrigerants in the second quarter and things like that you\u2019d start to see that improvement come throughout the year, so the first quarter is specifically problematic for Performance Chemicals.","Vincent Andrews","And then if I could just ask a question around PV, I mean I know solar and oil have very different purposes, but are you seeing or hearing anything that that suggests the sort of runaway for solar is going to change in the lower oil price environment?","Ellen Kullman","We haven\u2019t heard that yet and I think first of all solar is still pretty small, so having growth rates of 20% still can occur. They\u2019re also being put in the places where it is from a grid parity standpoint in places like China where they are just a -- and they have come out to say that by 2030 they\u2019re going to be capping CO2 emissions and some of that start to come from an increase in their renewable energy sources, and solar is a big part of that as they\u2019re the largest producer of solar modules. So we don\u2019t see that, a short-term blip in oil is taking the PV industry office long-term kind of projection.","Greg Friedman","So we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","From John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Nick each year you give tax guidance in October and then in the final two months of the year you seem to discover a lot of new tax info. This seasonality the ag business caused that or is it perhaps your integrated tax and currency hedging that causes these big swings in the last two months of the year in your tax outlook?","Nick Fanandakis","The last couple of years, a big part of that has been driven by the enactments around the legislation for the expenders package that were held out and then all of a sudden we saw brought back in certainly that happened this year held out until very late in the year and then ramped it for 2014. And as you know in \u201815 it\u2019s not in place. So I cannot use in my base tax rate the assumption that that is going to occur. I\u2019ve got to keep that out and run my books if it\u2019s not there and then if it gets enacted by year-end then I have to adjust for the full year at that point in time. So that\u2019s a big part of it. And then the other piece is it is difficult to get exactly the mix right of all the places over 90 different countries that we\u2019re operating in, exactly what the tax in those jurisdiction is going to be based on the actual sales that are going to accrue this. So the geographic mix does play a part in that, and you have to through that up as year-end, so we go through that final through up at year-end on that piece. So those are the main drivers.","John Roberts","And as a follow-up, has the higher pension liability effect the 2015 earnings at all or is that all incorporated into the fourth quarter adjustment?","Nick Fanandakis","The higher pension liability will be part of the non-op pension costs. So you\u2019ll see impacted, they won\u2019t be part of the operating earnings fee. And really what we\u2019re talking about here is on the funding the unfunded portion that really took that step up of close to $4 billion, $3.7 billion. It's funny it doesn\u2019t take much in the way of discount rate change to have a significant impact. Our rate assumptions for the calculations change by 80 basis points and we saw $2.8 billion impact of that alone. So small movements, as we saw last year when it helped us small movements can have a big impact on that unfunded position.","Greg Friedman ","Well I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call.

My name is John and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I'm going to now turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.","Gregory R. Friedman","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont\u2019s first quarter 2016 performance. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chair and CEO, Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO and Jim Collins, Executive Vice President responsible for our Agriculture segment.","The slides for today\u2019s presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and I direct you to slide one for our disclaimers.","All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today\u2019s slides, which are posted on our website.","Our agenda today, we\u2019ll start with Ed providing his perspective on this morning\u2019s then Nick will review our first quarter financial performance and 2016 guidance. Third, Jim will discuss our agriculture business. We will then take your questions.","With that introduction, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. I would like to share my perspective on the first quarter, then I\u2019ll update you on our progress with our three critical initiatives as well as our plan merger equals with Dow. Overall, I was pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter. Despite continued challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we delivered operating earnings of $1.26 per share even with last year\u2019s quarter.","Excluding $0.10 per share of negative currency, operating earnings rose 8%. Sales decline 2%, excluding currency reflecting the current environment. The weakening U.S. dollar gave us some relief. I don\u2019t want to steal any thunder from Jim, but it\u2019s worth saying a couple of things about Ag\u2019s first quarter.","Much of the quarter\u2019s strength was due to Ag. Solid execution in Ag, our largest segment enabled a strong start to the North American corn season. I\u2019m also very pleased with our results in this Safrinha season as we delivered strong volume growth. Nick and Jim will comment more on all that in a moment.","Looking beyond Ag, as I mentioned most of our other segments performed well. One we\u2019re calling out is Nutrition & Health, where we had broad based volume growth and significant operating margin expansion. Let me give you a couple of examples of new products are contributed to our growth N&H.","First, [Supero] (Ph) our new best-in-class protein isolated soy protein for dry-powdered beverages and second, our new long life Greek yogurts in China. Probiotics increased sales 30% as our productivity efforts have freed up capacity to respond to strong customer demand. I was pleased to see operating margins expand in four of our six segments including progress with our global cost savings and restructuring plan.","In some, most of our businesses exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We had a good start to the year. Yet planting is just beginning in the Northern Hemisphere and at this point it\u2019s too early to call the Europe for Ag. There are still number of difficult macro variables and we want to see how those factors play out.","Now, let me give you an update on our progress with the three critical priorities, I outlined when I became CEO. As a reminder, we said, we were committed to shrinking our cost structure, improving our working capital performance and reducing our capital expenditures. We strongly believe we need to improve our performance in all three areas as we want the benchmark against best-in-class companies in all of our businesses. The encouraging part is the quality of a leadership including their desire to win, which has impress me about DuPont from the start.","The point of our global cost savings and restructuring plan is to strengthen the competitiveness of our business while reducing our cost by $1 billion on a run rate basis by year-end. Consistent with this target, we plan to show you a net year-over-year saving of $730 million for full-year 2016.","We made good progress with this objective in the first quarter, in fact we are exiting quarter down about $135 million in operating cost mainly in SG&A. One area where we\u2019ve taken significant action is corporate cost. Already year-over-year we are down 44% on an operating earnings basis. I applaud the team for their hard work in getting us here.","This quarter puts us well on our way toward a $200 million year-over-year reductions in corporate cost. Also our global cost savings and restructuring plan is separate from an incremental to the cost synergies we expect to capture in connection with our planned merger of equals with Dow. The actions we have taken to abolish the Matrix organization have given our businesses full control of their P&Ls enabling faster decision making. The company is visibly moving at a faster clip.","Turning to working capital, earlier we set goals for improvements by business for 2016. In the first quarter, we launched a companywide project to improve working capital, we see opportunity in inventory first and foremost, but also in payable and receivables. Our first quarter results reflect our focus on working capital and capital spending resulting in a $300 million improvement in free cash flow year-over-year excluding Chemours.","We continue to expect to deliver improvements in working capital over the medium term. That said, this year\u2019s working capital performance will reflect pressure from our cost reductions program including severance payments, which are necessary to support our long-term objectives. Our capital spending in 2016 is expected to total $1.1 billion down from $1.4 billion last year excluding Chemours. That\u2019s a decline of 21%.","We spent about $360 million of CapEx in the first quarter and we reviewed each and every dollar before we spend it with a close eye on expected returns. Our first quarter CapEx spend is 14% below last year, again excluding [indiscernible]. As we work towards our planned merger with Dow and intended separations for three highly focused independent businesses, I\u2019m pleased with the progress that teams are making. We achieved a number of milestones towards closing the merger in recent weeks.","On March 1, we filed our initial Form S-4 full registration statement and recently filed the first amendment. That process is proceeding along smoothly. The Form S-4 will become effective after we complete the review process with the SEC, which we currently anticipate will be no later than the end of the second quarter. The special stockholders meeting for both companies shareholders to vote on the merger will take place thereafter.","We also have submitted key regulatory filings related to the merger in the major jurisdictions where we operate. We always expected a thorough review process and we are working closely with regulators and all the relevant jurisdictions to complete that process. We continue to expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.","Integration planning is well underway. We have formed a joint integration management office. Dow and DuPont are working directly together on plans to execute the merger, capture synergies and prepare for the intended business separations. The team is working diligently to develop execution ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the merger, capture our anticipated cost and revenue synergies and begin to operate as independent business units as soon as possible after the merger closes.","In coordination between with the joint integration management office, each of the three businesses is working to identify and plan for the right operating structure for their specific needs. Another important point I would like to make is our synergy targets for the combined company remain on track. We have 27 teams focused on different categories of cost and they are very clear about the goal is.","Our confident in the targets we established in December has done nothing but go up. After diving into the details, we continue to believe there will be at least $3 billion in cost and $1 billion in growth synergies on a run rate basis. We have benchmarked cost against industry peer alongside McKenzie and they have confirmed that the $3 billion is achievable. We continue to expect to capture $1.3 billion in Ag, $1.5 billion in Material Science and $300 million in Specialty Product cost synergies.","Now I would like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you Ed. Let\u2019s start with the details of the first quarter on Slide 3. Operating earnings of a $1.26 per share were even with prior year and up 8% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Solid execution in a tough macro environment particularly on cost savings and a strong start to the North American corn season in Ag positively impacted the quarter.","Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter declines 2%. Local pricing gains in Ag and industrial bioscience and volume growth in Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in most of the remaining segments. Currency continued to negatively impact sales by an additional four percentage points in the quarter.","I would like to highlight where we\u2019ve seen some positives from a regional perspective particularly in our developing markets, which represented above 30% of our first quarter sales. In the quarter, sales in developing markets were up 5% year-over-year excluding currency. The volume growth was primarily driven by Agriculture and Nutrition & Health in Europe and Asia Pacific principally China. Local pricing gains in Latin America and Europe were a result of mix enrichments and actions to offset currency primarily within Agriculture.","Turning to Slide 4, consistent with prior quarters currency was a significant headwind to segment results. Segment results when you exclude currency were up $0.02 per share in the quarter on cost savings, local price and product mix gains in agriculture and industrial biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health.","Lower corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.05 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than the prior year as a result of our 2016 cost savings program.","A lower share count benefitted the quarter by $0.05. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation and we\u2019re seeing the full benefit of this program here. A decrease in net after tax exchange losses contributed $0.02 to earnings in the quarter. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to our geographic mix of earnings.","Let\u2019s turn to the first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Operating earnings growth in Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Protection Solutions was more than offset by declines in the other segments. Nutrition & Health increased on a broad base volume growth and cost savings, which more than offset the negative currency that they saw. Operating margins in this segment improved 240 basis points and have grown year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters.","Growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected pricing gains on new product introductions in BioActives. Increased demand for Biomaterials and the absence of prior year one-time cost in Clean Technologies. Operating margins improved 250 basis points in the quarter for industrial Biosciences.","Protection Solutions\u2019 operating earnings increased $9 million as lower cost and improved plant utilization at the Chambers Work facility were partially offset by lower volumes in the negative currency impact. Operating margins improved 300 basis points in the quarter here.","In Electronics & Communication, operating earnings decreased $20 million as cost savings and increased demand for Tedlar film were more than offset by competitive pressures in Solamet paste, lower demand in consumer electronics and a $16 million litigation expense. I would like to highlight that while volume in Solamet paste were down year-over-year, we did see sequential volume growth from the fourth quarter of 2015 and we grew market share following the launch of our PV19B late last year.","Agricultural operating earnings declined $37 million year-over-year as local price and products mix gains and cost savings were more than offset by an $83 million negative currency impact, lower volumes and about $40 million negative impact from the port shutdown due to loss sales in inventory write-offs. Jim will provide further details of the first quarter performance with agriculture later in the call.","Performance Materials\u2019 operating earnings decline $44 million as lower cost and increased demand in Asia Pacific automotive markets were more than offset by lower demand for ethylene and ethylene based products, lower local price and negative impact from currency. The price decline was driven by lower ethylene prices as average spot prices were down approximately 50% year-over-year when we saw competitive pressure in commoditized products.","As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor centre website under events and presentations. I encourage you to refer to those slides for further details on segment results including our expectations for the second quarter and for the full-year 2016.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6. We maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Negative free cash flow of $2.2 billion reflects agriculture\u2019s typical seasonal cash outflow in the quarter. Our free cash flow improved by about $500 million year-over-year was about $200 million of improvement due to the absence of Chemours. The remainder of the improvement is due to lower working capital and CapEx in the first quarter.","Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2015 balance, which reflects our nominal seasonal shifts. Primary uses of cash in the quarter related to funding our seasonal agriculture working capital requirements, growth investments and dividends.","Returning capital to our shareholders remains priority and today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share. Our objective is to complete 2 billion in share repurchases in 2016. However, the planned merger of equals with Dow and the associated impact from SEC rules and regulations affects our trading windows. After the shareholder vote, we will evaluate the opportunities to enter the market and plan to make repurchases.","On Slide 7, the company now expects full-year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 per share from $2.95 to $3.10 previously announced. The estimated negative currency impact of a full-year 2016 is now expected to be $0.20 per share versus a previously communicated estimate of $0.30 per share. The U.S. dollar has weakened against most currencies since the estimate we provided in January.","For the full-year, we now expect our base tax rate to be about 24% an increase from our prior estimate of 23% due to the geographic mix of earnings. This results in a $0.10 headwind from higher base tax rate in the outlook versus our prior year.","Our guidance continues to reflect a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. While the businesses outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, about half of these was due to a stronger than expected start to the season in agriculture. The remainder was due to the underlying performance of the businesses and that is what we are reflecting in our revised outlook for the full-year.","From a first half 2016, we expect operating earnings to be even with prior year as the timing benefits primarily within agriculture from a stronger than expected start to North American corn season are anticipated to largely be offset in the second quarter. We continue to expect full-year net sales to be down low single-digits percent wise versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture.","Currency will continue to impact the top-line as the dollar is stronger than last year against most currencies primarily the Brazilian Real. Excluding currency, sales are expected to about even with prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 17% to 23% when we take out currency, primarily driven by the full-year benefit of cost savings. We remain cautious on our outlook for 2016 as market conditions continue to remain challenging.","In agriculture, the fundamentals have not changed since the outlook we provided in January. Net farm income is declining and season crop protection suppliers have abundant of inventory globally. Economists are currently forecasting lower global industrial production in key markets including the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and China. China\u2019s economic slowdown continues particularly with its industrial, real estate and financial sectors impacting the Asia-Pacific region.","Turning now to Slide 8. I would like to highlight where we stand on our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. As we previously communicated, we expect this plan will generate $1 billion on a run rate basis, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in 2016 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which would be weighted towards the second half of 2016.","For the first quarter, our operating costs, which includes SG&A, R&D and other operating charges declined about $135 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 7% decline in costs year-over-year. SG&A cost declined about $110 million or 9% versus last year on cost savings and currency benefits.","Our corporate costs on an operating earnings basis decreased 44% year-over-year and highlights that the actions we outlined in December are truly generating results. We are on track to deliver our 2016 commitments of $200 million decrease in corporate expenses improving to about 1.3% as a percent of sales.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of results and agriculture.","James C. Collins","Thanks Nick. Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected with famers facing challenging economic conditions and seed and crop protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So we\u2019re not seeing anything significantly different in market conditions from what we shared with you earlier this year, but even in this difficult environment, we remain focused in our executing on the variables that are within our control and I think our first quarter performance clearly illustrates that.","I'm focused on three very clear priorities. First, delivering on our 2016 cost savings and operating earnings commitments and our results for the quarter indicate we\u2019re firmly on-track to do that. Secondly, I\u2019ve been personally spending significant time reviewing our R&D programs with our research team to ensure we\u2019re delivering on our exciting pipeline of new genetics, biotech traits and crop protection products on schedule.","Lastly, from our announced merger with Dow, our teams are working with great urgency to create a world leading production Ag business and we\u2019re developing detailed plans to capture the $1.3 million of cost synergies. Even though, this is challenging work, you can feel the excitement of the teams. In addition to these three priorities, I also spend my time minimizing distractions, ensuring our teams keep their focus on delivering results or our stakeholders during this exciting time of change.","As I mentioned, our results in the first quarter demonstrated strong execution in challenging market conditions. Results were better than we expected primarily due to higher corn area in North America. Earlier timing of shipments to customer is consistent with the strong start we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 and stronger sunflower sales in Europe based on the performance of our newest products. Currency, while still a significant headwind compared to last year was also a little better and we anticipated.","What I\u2019m proudest of, is we were able to deliver 2% higher prices across the segment even in this highly competitive market environment. In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer\u2019s newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally and most importantly in North America. In crop protection, we took decisive pricing actions to mitigate a stronger U.S. dollar in Latin America and Eastern Europe and in fact, local pricing actions fully offset the impact of currency in Latin America.","Now in addition to local pricing gains, corn seed volumes were higher than the prior year from sales in North America consistent with the recent USDA reports indicating higher expected corn acres this year and in Brazil\u2019s Safrinha season. Our increases in corn and sunflower volume were more than offset by lower insecticide sales in Latin America and in sales to other third parties.","Additional offsets included the impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility, and from lower soybean volumes. Now most of the decline in insecticide volumes can be tied Brazil\u2019s low pest pressure, high industry inventories and the impact of insect protected soybean varieties.","Now turning to our pipeline, as planned, we made our first sales of Zorvec fungicide for disease control in Korea, Australia and China in the first quarter. We expect Zorvec to be very competitive in the $2 billion market for blight and downy mildew control, offering potato, grape and vegetable growers consistent, long-lasting control with a favorable environmental profile.","We successfully launched Leptra, insect protected corn hybrids in Brazil in the Safrinha season and initial indications of performance are good. Leptra\u2019s strong value proposition is also allowing us to recapture price in that market. Strong customer interest and an aggressive seed production plan have us well-positioned to ramp-up Leptra to as much as a third of our volume in the upcoming summer season, in one of the fastest technology introductions in Pioneer history.","In North America soybeans, we are currently introducing varieties with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology in a very limited launch. While we didn\u2019t plan for large volumes, this will allow our sales reps and customers to test the performance of these soybeans as we prepare for our full launch in 2017, pending regulatory approvals.","In addition to all of that, we had a really exciting announcement this past week. We announced our intention to commercialize our first corn hybrids, developed through the application of CRISPR-Cas advanced breeding technology within the five years. While this is a first step, our initial CRISPR-Cas offering allows us to lay a solid foundation for success for future products developed with this important innovation in plant breeding.","We now anticipate results for the full-year to be a little stronger than what we shared with you in January, primarily due to the recent weakening of the dollar against many global currencies, including the real, and from higher corn planted area. This will be partially offset by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter seed sales to first quarter 2017. This is a result of the enhancements we are making to our pioneer business as we transition to an agency based route to market approach in the Southern U.S. similar to the Advantage approach we take in the Midwest.","Additionally, we\u2019ll have some unplanned cost as a result of our recent decision regarding the LaPorte insecticide unit from the write-off and disposal of in process inventory and to dismantle the facility. We had a good start to the year, we have a lot going on in agriculture and I\u2019m very excited about the progress. I\u2019m confident the team is focused on delivering on our commitments, preparing for the merger and advancing our pipeline.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory R. Friedman","Thanks Jim. We will now open the lines for the questions. John if you could please provide the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you, good morning. There has been some talk about aggressive seed prices discounting in the U.S. this season. Could you address those concerns and how you are addressing that issues?","James C. Collins","Yes, great, thanks for that questions. We know those comments are out there. As we said back in January, we just weren\u2019t seeing much change in the conditions in the marketplace from where we launched, back in August or September. So we've had our pricing cards out there for a number of months. So when I look at pricing, I think of it in that area I think of it in three specific ways.","First is card price and that\u2019s that the year-over-year same technology, same market card pricing and as we said back in January, our card pricing in generally flat year-over-year. The second impact in our numbers then would be due to mix and we\u2019re seeing strong demand in our order book for our newest technology.","About 50% of our line-up in North America is from genetics that we\u2019ve put in the market in the last two years. So as growers have a chance to look at that two consecutive years in our yield trials they really jumped on that. So we\u2019re seeing a nice lift in overall mix. And then last would be in the discounting area and so these discounts come in a number of different area whether its early or early buy discounts or cash discounts and overall I would say we\u2019re seeing maybe a slightly elevated level of discounts, but nothing really out of the ordinary that you might expect.","Folks took a good advantage of some of programs that we had out there. I would also remind you that our direct sales model in North America gives us great visibility of our products and our pricing, especially at that net price levels. So we see almost on a real-time basis purchases and what is going there. So I think overall what this speaks to is a strong focus by our organization and a execution intensity in really driving the plan that we put out there back in August and September.","David Begleiter","Very good. Ed and Nick Just on performance materials. Can you look at the business ex-ethylene of underlying business due this quarter?","Edward D. Breen","Yes, when you look at the performance materials business, ethylene obviously did have a impact because spot prices were so much lower David as you know on a year-over-year basis like 50% down. But if you would have take that out the automotive segment was up slightly in Asia, almost a point, Europe up 1.7, North America was kind of flattish auto bills, but we did see a fairly good demand outside of the ethylene impact that you saw within that segment.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Hi good morning. Ed it sounded like you are optimistic about the working capital for the year and agriculture is coming in pretty much the way you thought it was. So do you have a working capital target, how much you think things will be better year-over-year either inclusive of the titanium dioxide separation or without it?","Edward D. Breen","We just introduced our working capital program in the first quarter, so we just got those launch, we were studying in detail in the fourth quarter what we thought the opportunity was. And over the medium term, I think we said last time, the opportunity looks like it\u2019s a good $1 billion dollars to a $1.3 billion somewhere in that range, what I call more best-in-class performance. So we have a big opportunity there, mostly it\u2019s the biggest piece in inventory, so we\u2019re very, very focused there.","And you know we are going to have some headwind this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of severance cost and all that. So again that\u2019s for the benefit of the company going forward, but if this won\u2019t happen just this year, we clearly will have traction this year. I think if you saw in the first quarter, we had slight improvement already in working capital and generated additional $300 million of free cash flow over this year over last year also because CapEx the way was lower by 14% year-over-year.","So, we\u2019re starting to get really good focus Nick and I had operating reviews with every business over the last week and working capital was a big part of the conversation with the teams. So I feel that confident will build momentum as the year goes.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","The CapEx for the year is supposed to be $1.1 billion, but you spent 360 in the first quarter. So you are annualizing at 1.4. Why was the CapEx so high in the first quarter? What did you spend on? And then do you really expect it to sharply drop in the second?","Edward D. Breen","Okay. Now if you look back at last year, our first quarter is always our high quarter the way we account for. Even having said that with us at the higher, this number, this quarter, we\u2019re still were 14% below last year. So we\u2019re trending properly, we said we will be down 21% for the year on CapEx. So when you look at our second quarter, there is a major drop off in CapEx spending in the plan. We\u2019re more front-end loaded, because the maintenance work that happens end of year, beginning a year and it\u2019s just the seasonality of it. So we will definitely nail the $1.1 million.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Thank you. Follow-up for Jim on Ag. Jim, crop protection was down 18% sales year-over-year in Q1. How do you expect that to unfold over the year and as you look at the year as a whole are you expecting corn seed share to be up in North America, or are you just being up in line with the increased market acreage?","James C. Collins","Well let\u2019s talk about the crop protection first. You are right, you did see some pretty significant declines in volume in the first quarter that was mostly tied to the insecticide business and a bulk of that in Brazil and we\u2019re still chasing two consecutive years of low pest pressure there. We\u2019re feeling the impact of insect protected varieties of soybeans that are in that market. And overall, I would say channel inventories there are still pretty elevated based on the two-years.","Our insecticide business as well and crop protection we\u2019re feeling the impact of the LaPorte shutdown that we had. Most of that is related to Vydate. We\u2019ve essentially replaced all of the methanol that we have been selling in previous years now through third-parties, but it\u2019s just been really tough to find good quality sources of [oxymill] (Ph). So you are seeing some of that year-over-year.","As we get into the second half of the year, we continue to drive the launches of Cyazypyr around the world. If I separate Brazil, Rynaxypyr sales growth has grown volumes every year since its launch and we expect to see good in roads. And I would say our crop protection business in North America started off pretty strong here this year, looking at the on-the-ground sales versus our out-the-door business, we feel really good about our penetration there.","It\u2019s still early in the season to talk about full-year, we still have a lot to go and when I think about corn share now again, a little early to call share. Agree with you, no doubt we\u2019re seeing volume increases in North America consistent with that USDA report on the 94 essentially million acres. We\u2019re seeing volume growth based on our new technology and our teams are going to stay really focused.","But like I said, it\u2019s way too early to talk about seed share. As of today, we\u2019re about 30% planted in North America. That is elevated. Normally we would be about 16% for this time of the year and again you saw some of that volume increase flow through in our first quarter, but we will see how things shake out around share for the full-year.","Don Carson","Jim, just to clarify, so you think crop protection will still be down for the year at double-digits, so are you gaining more and Ag operating income is coming from seed side?","James C. Collins","A little early to size the crop protection overall full-year, but I would expect it to be down year-over-year, again primarily we\u2019re still working to replace the optimal volumes and we\u2019re still struggling in that Brazil around insecticide.","Don Carson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","Hi guys congrats. Nicely done.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you.","Jonas Oxgaard","A question, your R&D seems to be down about 10%-ish. Wondered if you had some color on what are you targeting and how is that paying out?","James C. Collins","Yes Jonas. It is down about the 10% that was part of our whole program in our cost reduction plans. And I mean look just to tell you high level, we reviewed every major projects then and the R&D management teams made those decisions as we went, but we also kept in mind with the impending merger coming down the road. We really looked at programs, we also saw we were going to be double counting, double working on things like that to get there.","Interesting, and I\u2019ve made this point before, our R&D and ramped up the last 2.5-years.I would say fairly significantly in such a short period of time. The reductions we\u2019ve made which were mostly done within R&D really put us about the run rate, this company has historically run at on R&D, which I\u2019m very comfortable with kind of like 10-year average run rate on a percentage of sales basis is about rate where we\u2019ve always been. So that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re ending up.","Jonas Oxgaard","Very good. any particular programs you discontinued or its just across the board?","James C. Collins","It was programs in each of the businesses that we were concerned with the payback on and that\u2019s really how we looked at it on returns and looked at each business, all major programs and that\u2019s how we got there.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay good. Thank you.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you Jon.","Operator","Next questions is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning gentlemen. Given the nice results Nick I\u2019m guessing that takes the sting out of the Brady ruling for you.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","That\u2019s only a rumor Frank.","Frank Mitsch","As I think about the commentary regarding the tough market environment and the global IP slowing. Taking a look at your volumes down materially in Q3, down just 1% in Q4 and here down 2%. It\u2019s looking like you have a little easier comps in Q2 and certainly Q3 is stepping up in front of us. So how should we be thinking about DuPont\u2019s ability to maintain volumes or perhaps even grow volumes, but or is it just two [tough] (Ph) of an environment out there and how would you answer that question?","Edward D. Breen","Well look a bunch of angles, it depends by business, some of the businesses looks like growth is going to be very nice in the year and some product introductions in the second half of the year. Let me just start by overall saying to you, we\u2019re still counting on the year being relatively flat from volume price or an organic standpoint as we move forward. So if we had a minus two in the first quarter, just some slight improvement kind of in the second half of the year and then it really depends by business as you look at what it whether it\u2019s going to be, Nutrition & Health obviously good, we\u2019re seeing really broad based growth there.","And by the way the probiotics area is really hot like 30% growth and we\u2019re actually getting more product out the door, more efficiency in our facility. So that\u2019s a good sign, it should continue not just this year, but into the future and then on the IB side we\u2019re still counting on growth for the year in that business. And we have launches in a bunch of other businesses like Leptra and other products.","So we\u2019re feeling good as we look at the pipeline that you know will actually pick up a little bit more here and be running more flat on a revenue line basis. And I'm not planning or looking at anything pass that. I want the company to plan around that, I don\u2019t think its overly conservative, but if we plan around it we\u2019ll make some smart decision as we see upside later in the year more than better.","Frank Mitsch","Okay. So the view point is it\u2019s not overly conservative, but it will - you have lot of things moving up and I guess a little bit down. Hey Ed in describing the Dow transaction and the shareholder vote coming in Q3, which I think may have been a little bit later than what I had originally thought. So certainly closing before the end of the year, does this give you an up - I\u2019m curious what would be the lag between when the shareholder vote takes place and when you actually close the transaction. And are you looking to complete the $2 billion share buyback within that window or is that just something that can be executed until December 31 regardless of DowDuPont or just DuPont alone.","Edward D. Breen","I\u2019ll take the first one and let Nick handle share repurchase part. Just to clarify the dates, we\u2019re looking at shareholder vote at the end of second quarter somewhere in that timeframe. It looks like the timeline along with S-4 filings and all that where we just made our comments back. So that looks like it\u2019s around that timeframe and then I need to put an exact date on it, but I would say we\u2019re shooting for October, November kind of close of the transaction.","So both the second quarter shareholder votes are both Dow and DuPont\u2019s shareholders October November close. We\u2019re in great shape on all our filings in the key jurisdictions around the world you know the big ones, China, Europe, Brazil and obviously the U.S. all that\u2019s in motion. So for the timeline where we needed to be to try to hit those dates, we\u2019re in good shape.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","And for the amount Frank, like Ed said, we\u2019re going have the vote and then we\u2019ll evaluate the opportunities to enter the market and our plans obviously is to make those repurchases. We are going to be limited by trading windows even after the vote from normal black-out periods relating to earnings.","So the end state of when that merger takes place will influence the amount of time we have available to us to make those purchases. We can make the purchases as long as we are a DuPont company and once it forms DowDuPont well then obviously that would be a decision would have to made by the Board of that company.","Frank Mitsch","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks and good morning everyone. Jim just wondering the 93 million or 94 million acres of corn in the U.S., I mean obviously it\u2019s going to be helpful of volume metrically this year, but how do you sort of access the potential hangover from that if we have decent weather over the summer. Are you at all worried about having lower commodity prices in the fall and into next spring and given that\u2019s already a pretty competitive operating environment, I guess I'm just curious what your thoughts are there.","James C. Collins","Yes, I think it\u2019s a really great question. There is no doubt that our order book and our volumes in the first quarter indicated stronger increases in corn areas in the U.S. and that\u2019s consistent with that USDA report. Now our original guidance for the year assumed a slight increase. So I would agree with you, we\u2019re feeling some of that lift. However, the weather is always a big element here and we\u2019ve seen a wet period here in the Midwest.","Last couple of days have been great, we\u2019ve seen planting jump, I think we\u2019re about 30% planted as of today and that would be consistent again with what we\u2019re hearing that we\u2019re probably slightly earlier this season than the historical average which would be more about 16%. Historically tough, planted acres doesn\u2019t always equate to yield, we could still see some issues to summer especially during pollination where we know we can really take the top off of yield on any of those crops.","So kind of like you, we\u2019re in a wait and see mode, if the weather is perfect and we get 94 million acres, you are right we\u2019ll continue to see commodity prices at that low end of - I would say what I\u2019m calling the new normal range of that 320 to 420 kind of operating range. And that will continue to put stress on that farm income and keep farmers really focused on how do they get the most productivity off of everyone of their acres.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And then may be just a follow-up on Solamet. I heard that volume was up in the quarter but it seems like pricing is still weak from competitive perspective. If I remember back to 4Q, I think you said there were sort of a dual track of innovation coming this year where some came I think in the first quarter and more was coming later on. So how do you access your performance so far and what should the slope of the line be through the balance of the year?","James C. Collins","Yes the Solamet, if you look at it year-over-year it\u2019s still down very significantly from a shares standpoint. That compares as it a big part of the performance difference you see in electronics and communication over the year, but on a sequential basis, we did have market share proven, we thought we bottomed out in the fourth quarter and we did bottom out in the fourth quarter.","We did have a product introduction at the end of the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re picking up here on. We are expecting the next introduction by mid-year and we think that will put in the lead here from a technology standpoint than continue to gain share. So again, very off from a year-ago, but now picking up and starting to pick up share.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next questions is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. Our corn belt channel checks has indicated that Pioneer has gained some traction this year, tying the financing on seed sales to crop protection, chemical sales. Can you comment on how much of a benefit that\u2019s been for you given our channel checks indicate pricing is broadly down and yet you are reporting corn seed pricing to be modestly up?","Edward D. Breen","Yes Steve, so you are right. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to collaborate between our Pioneer and our crop protection organizations. If you remember back from the Bank of America Ag Conference, I talked a little bit about that collaboration. This is about looking at our crop protection share with our key Pioneer customers and being able to offer a broad portfolio of solutions. So collaborating with them upfront to think about how do we connect the best technology we can to that acre opportunity for grower productivity.","If you do look at North America, you are right our price is up in the market and as we said to you we\u2019re attributing that to a couple of areas, mostly we think it\u2019s on new technology. About half of our line-up in North America is brand new in the last two years and you will know that we do impact trialing and even on farm trialing for a couple of years ahead of time. So growers get the chance to take a good look at new genetics before they commit fully and so a big part of our lift in North America is that they went all in on a lot of that new technology this season.","Steve Byrne","And would you say that lift could be accelerated post the merger with Dow where your crop protection chemical platform would be broader at that point?","Edward D. Breen","There is no doubt that we\u2019re excited about a broader portfolio of offerings, we\u2019ll be able to offer much more choices to growers out there in the marketplace. So it\u2019s a little too early for us to begin to speculate on how we might execute against that but yes no doubt that there will be more choices out there.","Steve Byrne","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar","Hi good morning. In electronics you saw 9% volume drop and you talked a little bit about Solamet paste. How much of the decline was in solar versus how much of it was in consumer electronics? And then in consumer electronics what are the products where you are seeing these declines?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","So if you look at the pieces in PV, P.J., there is an element of the photovoltaic that was very strong. Our Tedlar film volume grew in the Tedlar film side of the house. Now there is no doubt as Ed already mentioned that from the Solamet paste side on a year-over-year basis a significant change in volume on that product line. Consumer electronics was weaker, we did see weaker demand and we actually anticipate that to continue in quarter two and start to turn in the second half of the year. The exact breakdown of how much is electronics versus how much is PV, I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips right now. ","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. Thank you. And then generally at the free cash flow, if its back free cash flow defined as operating cash flow minus CapEx and it has declined materially in the last three-years compared to prior levels. So given that and given your significant new cost cutting, do you have any specific goals for free cash flow this year? Thank you.","Edward D. Breen","Specific targets, is that what you said P.J.?","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Specific targets for this year.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","What we have is a very active plant in place now around working capital improvements, which is going to be a key element to generating additional cash flow from operations as we look at that and as you already heard, we have reductions in our CapEx. So all of those programs that are in place are going to be generating improvements around the free cash flow line. We haven\u2019t quantified the total impact in the current year yet, we\u2019ve talked about it more in the medium time period of the impact those programs are going to have.","Edward D. Breen","One last question?","Operator","Our final question is from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you. Ed, do you still expect to be able to achieve a split into three businesses within 18-months to 24-months of the mergers close. And then you have made comments in the past that the corporate overhead the three separate entities would not be higher than that at the parent. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s still your expectation?","Edward D. Breen","Yes, we\u2019re definitely planning Sandy the 18-month to 24-months period. We\u2019ve have a lot of teams going that are already doing some of the work to help us out on that timeline, as I think we mentioned before we\u2019ve already started the financial carve out work, so we\u2019ll get way ahead on that part of schedule. So yes, the timing in the 18-months to 24-months were very comfortable, then obviously we would all like to pull that in if we can, but that\u2019s the timeline rolling now and we\u2019ll keep working that as we go forward.","Our plan is with the reductions we\u2019ve done here, our plan would be and by the way I did this in my prior life, but we\u2019re going to keep the overhead percent of sales down where we\u2019re getting them to with the reductions of both companies are making as we speak. So to me a more of a world class percent, the corporate overhead is approaching 1% of sales and we\u2019re as I think Nick mentioning, we\u2019re down to 1.3% of sales with the actions we\u2019ve taken. So we\u2019re kind of getting in that zip code and that\u2019s where we plan to be with each of the companies.","Sandy Klugman","Okay great, thank you and then a follow-up on Ag, you mentioned losing out on some insecticide sales in Latin America, due to the presence of traded corn, outside of Latin America are you seeing the crop chemical category loseout theseed just giving how takeover margins are? Have you seen that dynamic anywhere outside?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Outside of Latin America, not that it would remarkable here, as I think about how the season is unfolding. We\u2019re excited about the start to North America, we\u2019re seeing as I mentioned good flow through to on-the-ground sales versus out-the-door and our business in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe had a strong start to the year. So a little early for Asia, little more seasonal effect on Asia as we get further into the year, but right now it\u2019s all about Brazil.","Sandy Klugman","Okay, thank you very much.","Gregory R. Friedman","Thank you very much. This now concludes our call. Thank you for your interest in DuPont and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions]","Please note that the conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.","Greg Friedman","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's third-quarter 2014 performance.","Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO. The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide 1 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve a number of risks and assumptions.","We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides posted on our website.","For today's agenda, Nick will review our third-quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. I will provide business segment insights, and we'll conclude with Ellen's comments, followed by your questions.","With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you, Greg.","Starting with slide 2, you will see the highlights of our third quarter. We delivered $0.54 operating earnings-per-share versus $0.45 last year. That's 20% growth in a sluggish macroeconomic environment outside of North America, and significant year-over-year headwinds in agriculture.","Sales were down 3%, reflecting the impact of portfolio changes. Specifically, the sale of GLS\/Vinyls, our Sontara and Stonetech businesses, along with the disposition of our aniline facility at Baytown, and the sale of our interest in a joint venture in Europe. All of these actions are aligned with our strategy to enhance the value creation of our portfolio.","Volume gains were largely offset by price reductions. Total segment operating earnings margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing efforts to enhance the value of our portfolio. In total, the results for the third quarter are in line with our previous announced expectations, and reflect solid performance among our businesses.","Let's turn now to slide 3, and I'll cover the results for our reporting segments. We entered the third quarter with headwinds in agriculture, and continued uncertainty in international markets. We delivered double-digit segment operating earnings growth in our Safety & Protection, and Nutrition & Health segments.","Volume gains in Nutrition & Health, along with productivity improvements in Safety & Protection, provided substantial margin improvement across these businesses. And contributed to strong operating earnings growth. Nutrition & Health improved margins almost 200 basis points, and Safety & Protection improved margins more than 300 basis points in the quarter.","In Agriculture, earnings were up due to strong insecticide and fungicide volumes in Latin America, which benefited from new product launches. However, seed sales were lower due to well-known reduction in corn seed planted acres and lower corn seed pricing in Latin America.","In our Performance Materials segment, operating earnings were up slightly year-over-year. As increased demand for auto and industrial markets was offset by the sale of GLS\/Vinyls earlier in the year. In Performance Chemicals, lower prices for refrigerants and TiO2, coupled with the negative impact of portfolio changes resulted in 5% lower segment operating earnings in the quarter.","Turning now to slide 4. Sales were down 3% on a global basis, almost entirely due to the portfolio changes we've undertaken in line with our strategic focus. Volume gains were offset by lower prices.","Our sales in developing Asia were up 4%, led by China where most businesses realized volume improvements during the quarter. In fact, our sales in China delivered more than three-fourths of the growth we saw in developing Asia. The volume increases were partially offset by currency, price, and the impact of portfolio changes.","In EMEA, while about half of the decline in sales is due to portfolio changes, sales were sluggish in both developing and developed countries, reflecting weak demand in most markets. We currently see this sluggish demand continuing in EMEA for the remainder of the year. Sales declines in the Americas were the result of portfolio changes, and lower agricultural sales.","Turning now to slide 5. You see that our 20% growth in operating earnings-per-share in the quarter is attributable to a combination of segment operating earnings growth, lower interest expense, a slightly lower tax rate, and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. Portfolio changes also had a negative impact to the operating earnings of about $0.03 per share in the quarter.","As you know, in recent months, the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all currencies. While adverse currency impact in the third quarter was minor on a year-over-year basis, we see a strong headwind in the coming quarters. For the fourth quarter, we now expect at least $0.05 per share year-over-year, this compares to our expectation in July of virtually no currency impact in the second half.","Turning to slide 6. Our free cash flow for the first nine months of 2014 versus last year has improved about $400 million. This is due primarily to the absence of tax payments related to the sale of performance coatings, which occurred in 2013.","Consistent with prior years, we anticipate strong seasonal cash flow in the fourth quarter. With a challenging ag environment, we see additional headwinds, which may impact our full-year free cash flow. Net debt at September 30th reflects our normal seasonal pattern of cash flows, and is up about $800 million from the prior year.","In August, we entered into a $700 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to substantially complete our $2 billion share repurchase commitment for 2014. We expect final settlement of the ASR in the fourth quarter.","We estimate that average diluted shares outstanding for the full year will be about 922 million shares, and 913 million shares for the fourth quarter. As we've said, share repurchases are one way we return value to our shareholders, and we use them to complement our strong dividends.","Last week, our Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.47 to be paid in December. In total, by year end, we will have returned nearly $9 billion to our shareholders since 2009 in the form of dividends. Representing a 15% increase in our quarterly pay out during that period.","In addition, during the same period, we will have completed more than $4 billion in share repurchases. Under our current share repurchase plan that was announced in January of 2014, we have completed $2 billion of the $5 billion program.","Moving now to slide 7. I'll just reiterate that our redesign initiatives are underway in delivering about $0.02 of benefit in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our outlook includes about $0.04 of benefit from these actions.","Additionally, as we said in July, we're well on track for our Performance Chemicals separation, with expected filing of the Form 10 with the SEC in mid-December of this year. And we expect separation costs to be about $0.16 per share this year, and about $0.19 to $0.22 per share next year. In addition, we have now finalized all the key leadership appointments for the new Performance Chemicals organization to ensure a successful spin in mid-2015.","Regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter, we clearly see uncertainties in the global economy. Shifts in the agricultural industry, along with stiffer currency headwinds. However, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on cost productivity, and other corporate initiatives.","Overall, we expect our fourth-quarter operating earnings-per-share to grow about 20% from last year's $0.59 per share. Matching the growth rate achieved in the third quarter, and within our previously communicated outlook range of $4 to $4.10 per share for the full-year. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year is in line with current street estimates.","On that note, I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?","Greg Friedman","I'd now like to provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the Investors center website, under Events and Presentations. Along with the other materials for today's call.","Turning to Safety & Protection on slide 8. Third-quarter segment operating earnings of $201 million increased 18%, and operating earnings margins increased over 300 basis points. Operating earnings are benefiting from improved margins and rich mix, increased demand from industrial markets, and continued benefits from cost productivity.","Kevlar demand growth was driven by increased sales into transportation, industrial, and wire and cable sectors. While Nomex demand growth was fueled by thermal industrial automotive applications.","Regionally, sales volume growth in Asia-Pacific and the US was offset by lower volumes in Latin America and Europe. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales growth in the mid single-digit range, and earnings growth in the high single-digit percent range on the higher operating margins and sustained operational productivity.","On slide 9, this was another strong quarter for our Nutrition & Health segment. Sales were up 4%, led by volume growth in specialty proteins, probiotics, and cultures, and continued momentum in enablers. We continued to expand in emerging markets, growing segment sales 10% in the quarter.","Operating earnings were up 23% to $100 million from the higher sales and operating margin improvement, due to mix enrichment, productivity actions, and lower raw material costs. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement.","In the fourth quarter, we expect low single-digit percent sales growth from broad-based volume gains, including continued growth in emerging markets. This is expected to be partially offset by headwinds in Western Europe, which remained weak from repercussions of the Russia food import ban and a negative impact from currency. Operating earnings are expected to be up in the mid single-digit percent range of sales growth, improved mix, productivity actions, and lower raw material costs.","In our agriculture segment on slide 10, third-quarter results are largely driven by the Summer growing season in Latin America. A seasonal operating loss of $55 million was slightly better than the prior year, and in line with our expectations heading into the quarter, despite an increasingly challenging environment in agriculture. During the quarter, we saw a further decline in corn and soybean commodity prices, as farmers in North America anticipate a record harvest.","Sales for the quarter were 4% below the prior year, as a volume growth in insecticides and fungicides, mainly in Latin America, was more than offset by lower corn seed and herbicide volumes. Price for the segment was down 2%, resulting from lower corn seed prices in Brazil as anticipated, and the negative impact of currency, primarily the real. In segment operating earnings, lower seed input costs and operating cost improvements were partially offset by the lower sales and the absence of a prior year $26 million gain from the acquisition of a controlling interested in Pannar.","As we wrap up the 2014 North America growing season, the USDA won't issue final 2014 acreage until January of next year. However, based on the October preliminary estimate, a 90.9 million acres, North America corn market share likely declined between 1 to 2 points 2014 following strong gains in 2013 and over the past several seasons. In soybeans in North America, 2014 market share is expected to be between 1 and 2 points lower as we continue to transition our line up to new higher performing Pioneer T series varieties, and launch products containing the Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait.","Turning to the outlook. The fourth quarter in agriculture is driven by the completion of the Brazil Summer season, and shipments to position product for the upcoming safrinha season in Brazil and for the 2015 northern hemisphere seasons. The operating environment will continue to be challenging, as farmer net income and corn planted area remain under pressure across the globe. In addition, a stronger US dollar against the real, euro, and rand will likely create stronger headwinds to sales and operating earnings.","In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be about flat. For the segment, we expect continued growth in crop protection volumes to be offset by lower corn seed price in Brazil, and the negative impacts of currency. Operating earnings are expected to be positive for the second year in a row, and similar to or above the prior-year's fourth quarter.","As we begin to look forward to the 2015 season, we are pleased with what our customers are seeing during the corn and soybean harvest. And we'll provide further details on Pioneer brand competitive performance in the next few weeks.","The broad scale launch of our Encirca yield service, where the nitrogen management has exceeded our expectations as growers look to maximize profitability on every acre. In Crop Protection, performance of our new product launches in customer fields is very encouraging.","While it is too early to speak for planted area or earnings expectations for next year, we do anticipate 2015 will be a dynamic challenging year for farmers, given a reduced net cash income and growing global grain stocks following this year's harvest. However, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals for sustainable demand growth in agriculture.","In Performance Materials on slide 11, sales were down 3%, due primarily to the impact of a portfolio change. Absent the portfolio change, volumes and prices increased across the segment. Operating earnings were up 1% on solid demand in automotive, construction and industrial applications.","Ethylene margins in the quarter were at record levels, driven by high ethylene prices and low cost ethane. Our industry-leading operating margins were near 24%, fueled by favorable ethylene dynamics, and the continued benefit of productivity measures.","In the fourth quarter, we anticipate flat sales as the impact of portfolio changes offsets anticipated volume growth. We expect operating earnings percent growth in the high teens on improved margins and mix.","Turning to Industrial Biosciences on slide 12. Operating earnings were up 4%, as the ethanol industry fundamentals remained favorable during the quarter which drove increased volume for DuPont's novel enzymes.","In other key end markets, demand was mixed. Sales of Sorona polymer for carpeting were flat, due to softer demand and existing home sales partially offset by increased sales of Sorona in [apparel].","We continue to see solid demand for Axtra Phy in animal nutrition and healthy food enzyme sales. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales will be up in the mid-single-digit percent range, above prior-year's record revenue. Fourth-quarter operating earnings are expected to be up substantially, on richer mix, higher sales, and improved product costs.","On slide 13, sales in Electronics & Communications were 2% lower in the quarter. Volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.","Operating earnings of $94 million were $3 million lower, as lower sales and a decrease in other income were partially offset by productivity gains. Segment results were negatively impacted by declines in Solamet pate, as intense competition has impacted price and share in this business.","The fourth quarter, we expect to launch a new advantage paste product in the PV market. The photovoltaic market continues to be an attractive space for DuPont. We are the market and technology leader, and are driving a robust innovation pipeline aimed at furthering solar cell efficiency in module life time, which will support continued growth in the overall market.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, global photovoltaic module installations are expected to grow, fueled by installations in China. We anticipate the photovoltaic paste market will remain competitive, and expect continued strength in consumer electronics. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to be down in the low single-digit percent range, primarily due to lower metals pricing with operating earnings up in the mid single-digits percent range.","In Performance Chemicals on slide 14, segment sales of approximately $1.6 billion were down 8%, due primarily to a portfolio change in chemicals and fluoro products. Prices for this segment were lower in aggregate, with slightly higher volumes in chemicals and fluoro products, offset by lower volumes in Ti02. Operating earnings were down 5%, primarily due to lower segment prices.","In Ti02, volumes were down 2% from the prior year, due primarily to slower demand from economic challenges in Europe. Year-to-date, Ti02 volume has improved 2% versus the prior year. Despite gradual improvement in industry fundamentals, Ti02 prices were down 1% sequentially, and 3% on a year-over-year basis.","We believe our customers inventory levels are stable, and producer levels remain essentially unchanged. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate low single-digit percent sales growth and operating earnings growth in the high teens percent range on improved volumes and productivity measures.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ellen for her closing thoughts.","Ellen Kullman","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.","As Nick highlighted, we delivered a solid quarter, with 20% operating earnings-per-share growth. We accomplished this despite a weakening environment in agriculture, softer demand in Europe, and the impact of our portfolio changes.","Our continued focus on productivity, innovation, and disciplined execution served us well. We'll continue to rely on that formula in the coming quarters to navigate a persistently challenging and volatile external market.","This morning, I'd like to step back and place the progress we are making in the context of our broad strategic plan. We have been moving steadily forward on clear path to deliver higher growth, and higher value for our shareholders. Executing a plan that is delivering value today, while positioning us for future growth.","A key element of that plan, creating two strong independent companies through the spinoff of our Performance Chemical business, is on track and on schedule. Following the spin, DuPont will continue to advance our three areas of strategic priority.","In Agriculture and Nutrition, we are extending our leadership position across the high-value science driven segments of the agriculture to food value chains. In Advanced Materials, we are strengthening and growing our leading position in high-value materials businesses by leveraging new technologies. In Industrial Biosciences, we're building transformational new businesses, leveraging our world leading biotechnology capability.","Through these areas of focus, we are helping customers find solutions to respond to growing global demand for more, safer, nutritious food; high-performance, cost-effective, energy-efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and increasingly, renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. We know that our progress in these areas and the value it creates are of primary importance to our customers and our shareholders. As we leverage the full capability of DuPont to create a new outcomes in these spaces, we're building on the key actions we have taken over the past five years to increase growth and value.","These include ongoing portfolio refinements to focus on emerging areas of opportunity, aggressive cost management and productivity improvements, and disciplined capital allocation. Our actions have delivered strong results.","Since 2008, our total shareholder return through September 30th was more than 250% substantially above the S&P 500, and our proxy peers. During the 2008 to 2013 time period, we more than doubled our operating earnings, excluding pharma, and delivered a 650 basis point improvement in our adjusted segment operating margins due to productivity improvements.","Throughout this period, we also remained committed to returning capital to shareholders. We returned more than $9 billion to shareholders through dividends since 2009. During the same period, we reinvested about $18 billion in capital expenditures and research and development to grow the long-term value of our Company.","In addition, share repurchases have accelerated, and we executed $2 billion of our $5 billion share buyback program. Looking ahead, we are committed to reinvesting for long-term sustainable growth, while returning capital to shareholders.","As most of you know, we describe DuPont is a science company. That's because over the course of our history, we have created novel solutions for the needs of any given era by connecting our science to the marketplace. We're doing this today as we leverage our unique combination of world-class science and technology, deep value chain knowledge, and deep market insight to solve big customer's problems on a global scale.","This total system of innovation continually renews our portfolio by creating entirely new product lines, and a steady flow of new and end market applications for our products. In parallel, our innovation system also delivers new ways to lower the cost of making our products. This combination of new products, new market applications and lower manufacturing costs is how our innovation system has enabled us to prosper over so many decades.","In 2013, this innovation delivery system generated $10 billion in revenue from new products launched over the prior four years. Our global reach and infrastructure significantly enhances our ability to access and penetrate new markets, where we deploy our rich offering of product and solutions to new customers. In developing countries, where our sales have almost doubled in the past five years, our agriculture business, as first entrant opens the doors for our other businesses.","You can see the full force of DuPont's portfolio leverage, and competitive advantages at work in many of our sector categories. In Energy, for example, our portfolio of products and technologies are delivering complex solutions that help secure a better energy future, and meet a wide range of customer needs.","In Advanced Materials, we provide multiple products for traditional oil and gas application to increase output or reduce downtime between repairs. We provide Nomex products for wind energy applications, and Solamet and Kevlar products for photovoltaics.","In Industrial Biosciences, we are a global leader in biofuels with our ethanol fuel enzymes. In advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol enhanced by Pioneer's product offering, deep agronomic knowledge, and access to growers. In Performance Materials, our products and application know-how are vital to create lightweight vehicles and improve fuel efficiency.","With our current portfolio, we are a single source of multiple solutions, and we are well-positioned to shape and leverage emerging trends. Importantly, we are uniquely positioned to capture the full breadth of the emerging bio-based opportunity, with all the capabilities needed to create new categories of renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. DuPont's pipelines of next-generation renewable products is poised to drive important growth for the Company, which will create long-term benefit for our shareholders.","These opportunities draw directly on the knowledge and science capability of our bio-based businesses, the chemistry and material science of our Advanced Materials businesses, and the feedstock knowledge from our agriculture businesses. With these competitive advantages as a foundation, we recognized that we need to keep driving for improved productivity and efficiency.","This year, we continued to take decisive action to build on our strength, to focus our efforts on areas where our science is advantaged, and accelerate our productivity initiatives. In 2014 alone, we have completed five portfolio actions to further streamline our portfolio, aligned with our science. And as I mentioned, we remain on schedule to separate Performance Chemicals' segment in mid-2015.","Beyond portfolio optimization, we are accelerating our existing cost and productivity efforts. Over the past five years, we consolidated 23 businesses into 12, and reduced senior leadership by more than 20%. These measures have strengthened our operating leverage, as evidenced by our strong margin improvements during the same period.","Our improved processes are driving quicker decision making, yet we recognize the need to do more. This year, we are implementing a high-performing operating model for the post-spin DuPont, with a streamlined structure and a smaller cost base. Following a comprehensive review of our cost structure in connection with the pending Performance Chemicals separation, we announced our fresh start redesign initiative, which is expected to result in savings of at least $1 billion.","As we execute our separation plans, we will continue to explore opportunities to further streamline both Companies and deliver value for DuPont's shareholders. Against this backdrop of progress and momentum, one of our shareholders, Trian Fund Management, has publicly disclosed a proposal made to DuPont. We value their input, as we do the import of all of our shareholders.","In that regard, we have held a number of constructive discussions with Trian. We considered Trian's ideas in the context of our plan to build a higher growth, higher value company. And we believe Trian's proposals in certain important respects are aligned with the direction we set more than five years ago, and the related actions we are taking.","However, we know that our businesses enjoy competitive advantages from being part of DuPont. The combined power of DuPont's science platform, our global scale, market access, and infrastructure leverage, along with our established brand and solid financial foundation have enabled us to deliver strong returns and will continue to do so in the future.","In addition, our current capital structure provides us with important financial flexibility we need to pursue strategic growth opportunities in light of regional and highly seasonal agricultural cash flows. We know our investors share our goals for delivering increased value, and we will continue to dialogue with all shareholders.","In closing, our Board of Directors, our management team, and I, are confident our plan will deliver sustained and superior value for our shareholders. Our track record demonstrates that we have a winning strategy in place, and are never finished with operational improvement and portfolio refinement, guided by our science advantage to create significant value for our shareholders. We are moving forward with urgency and purpose to deliver the increased value you expect, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you.","Greg?","Greg Friedman","Thanks, Ellen. Let's now open the line for questions on the Company's third-quarter results and our strategy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes, good morning. Just maybe kick it off here by asking for a bit more color on what's driving the conviction behind the 4Q results and ag being flat or higher year over year, given some of the uncertainties around 2015, and some of the price card changes to products that contain Herculex 1 in Brazil. Just looking for you to weigh those kinds of things.","Ellen Kullman","Great, Mike. Thanks for the question. We expect the weaker environment in ag to continue. But there are some positives that are occurring. You see it in our crop protection volume, with our new launches like Dermacor that are taking hold. Seed input costs are lower, so that's a benefit from an earnings standpoint. We expect shipments for North American safrenha to be about similar with what we saw in the fourth quarter last year, so that's kind of a draw.","Certainly, currency is going to be a negative. But as you know, we've been driving productivity and cost discipline. And so, as you factor all those things together, we're going to see the kind of results we talked about in the fourth quarter.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, that makes sense. And a question on FX: It seemed like this quarter, or I'm sorry, looking into the fourth quarter, the $0.05 headwind being more or less offset by some of the portfolio and productivity actions. Is that a reasonable framework to think about how things may play out in 2015? Obviously, impossible to guess were FX is going to go, but in terms of the portfolio actions and productivity actions that you're embracing, could that offset potential FX headwinds?","Ellen Kullman","Nick?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, Mike. As you said, it's extremely difficult to try to forecast what 2015 is going to do. I believe 2015 will remain a currency headwind for us as we start out the year. And we're talking, like I said, the fourth quarter of this year being at least $0.05 in the way of a headwind, where before we were saying it was going to be essentially flat.","The work we're doing around Fresh Start in the fourth quarter will go a long way to offsetting that currency headwind that we're going to experience in quarter four. We're looking to see about $0.04 benefit there from that productivity effort.","And, as far as our ongoing efforts, Fresh Start \u2013 we'll continue to see value realized from that work, as well as our underlying DNA productivity work that we have going on in all businesses in all functions, where we're always looking to, at a minimum, offset inflation. But it's too difficult to call at this point in time what the exact trade-off will be between the exchange rates for 2015, and some of those other efforts we have under way.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks very much. Ellen, will the DuPont Board formally vote on the Trian proposal of splitting the Company into an industrial piece, and, call it, a life sciences or agricultural piece? Or will it not do so?","Ellen Kullman","Well, as you know, Jeff, we've been actively engaged with constructive dialogue with Trian for over a year. Each one of these engagements, the Board has been informed and\/or involved in some of those discussions. We continue to dialogue with them, and that's part of the process. We do it with all of our shareholders, and those conversations are private, and we continue to drive forward on delivering our plan for increased value.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then for my follow-up, what's your theory of why the North American corn business lost 1 point or 2 of share in corn? And how might that share loss be remedied in the future?","Ellen Kullman","Sure. As you know, just to put it in some perspective, in corn in North America, we've gained some 7 points of share between 2008 and 2013. Last year, even gaining 1 point of share. And this year, it's a very competitive market. Corn acres are down. There's a lot of activity going on.","And it looks like, if the USDA numbers hold true when they come and finalize them in January, that we lost about 1 point this year or a little more than that. We're confident in our future. We gained 1 point last year; this year we lost a little bit.","Next year we've got a great lineup. I'm very confident in the pipeline with the new genetics, and the expanding triple portfolio. It's a very competitive market, area by area, county by county. And I think that we have had good momentum over the past few years, and very confident in our future.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Ellen, I noticed that R&D spending was actually down 5% this quarter year over year. Given the focus on R&D overall in the Company, is this more of a trend we should see going forward, or how should we think about R&D spending?","Ellen Kullman","Yes. I think that, first of all, our strategy relative to R&D has not changed, and our focus on it. There are two things that I would say you have to consider when you take a look at any individual quarter.","And one is, is that we do have a portion of our R&D is done by outside vendors. It's some of the testing and the things like that, and a lot of the work that's done there. Those invoices are lumpy and relatively large. So, whether it hits in a quarter or not, it's always hard to predict.","I think the second thing to consider is that we expect our research and development to be as productive as we expect the rest of the Company. It's not a sacred cow, in that they don't have to improve and get more effective every year.","And I think Doug Muzyka has been leading a tremendous effort at really getting more out of the pipeline, and getting more done, and leveraging the resources we have. And so, I'm really proud of the work done there. I think most importantly, our strategy around research has not changed.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And, Ellen, just on Fresh Start, and Nick as well, is there a phase II to this program? And any way to accelerate some of the savings into 2015 from even 2016?","Ellen Kullman","So, as you know, we've been very aggressive in terms of what we said we'll accomplish in 2015 by the end of the fourth quarter being at a run rate of a savings of $660 million, $600 million-something a year out of the $1 billion a year. We continue to work with the businesses and the functions around the world at the timing of those moves. Some of it has to occur with the spin. Others, we're trying to get ahead of. So, I don't know, Nick, if you want to add anything to that?","Nick Fanandakis","I think, as you look at the numbers, David, and you look at the accrual that we took back in June 30 time period, and it was about \u2013 a little over $260 million. And we're talking about $1 billion worth of value that's going to be created. So, obviously, there will be additional work and effort going on around further accruals, and for the savings that will be realized as we projectized a lot of this work that we have going on right now.","Operator","And our next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citi.","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. In soybeans, you are ramping up on the Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, so that mostly explains your share loss there. When do you think you will be fully ramped up on Roundup Ready 2, and would you be able to stop the share loss?","Ellen Kullman","So, when will be \u2013 I'm sorry, PJ. You broke up a little bit. Was the question when we'll be fully ramped up on Roundup Ready 2?","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Right. When will you be fully ramped up, and when do you expect to stop that share loss?","Ellen Kullman","So, the transitions are occurring now, and it starts small, as you know, and we're in the ramp of the T series. And the ramp is going to be based on performance. We're out there actively looking at the test plots this year; we'll have more data coming through the end of this season.","We continue to focus on getting it ramped as fast as possible, but it has to be based on improved performance than the current varieties. So, we're very confident in that, but I think it's hard to give you, right now at this point in time, an exact percentage and year. And we'll get clearer on that as we get the data from this season, and move into really establishing it for the 2015 season.","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. And a quick question from Nick. And so, Nick, this year in 2014, you benefited from lower pension liability. But with recent rates going down recently, do you expect headwinds in 2015?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, PJ, obviously with the discount rates declining, that is going to have a negative impact on our pension liabilities as we go forward next year. Just to give you a sizing, if you were to have 100-basis-points reduction in interest rates, it's roughly about a 10% impact on our unfunded pension portion of the liability.","So, it will have an impact. We'll scale that much more definitively as we close out the year, and we look at that January rates as we calculate our unfunded pension going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk \u2013 you mentioned that the card prices in Brazil had to reflect some adjustment for the Herculex trait. What do your card prices in North America look like? And what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint from the smaller players in that market? We've heard from your large competitor on pricing, but what's happening across the rest of the markets on corn seed?","Ellen Kullman","Thanks, Bob. As you know, seed establishes the yield and the potential, and farmers take that decision very seriously. Our price cards are flat that we just put out last month. But we think mix is going to be a driver in 2015, as it was in 2014. So, we think there's going to be a positive impact for mix.","Our experience out working in the fields right now is that growers are still demanding high-yielding product, and we're not seeing a trading-down phenomenon, as I think there was some concern about. As for our competition, I don't speak for them. So, we're still looking at having the new genetics and the expanded triples be a positive for us from a mix standpoint in 2015.","Bob Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And my follow-up: From a competitive intelligence standpoint, what do you think is happening in the TiO2 markets? Because it seems like, other than China, we haven't heard a lot about capacity beyond your own. Yet it seems like the industry is unable to get any pricing improvement despite, what I think you referenced, a couple percent improvement in volume for the industry this year?","Nick Fanandakis","Maybe I'll handle that, Bob. So, when you look at the TiO2 industry right now and you look at volume, we're going to be up for the year probably about 2%. And that kind of volume is in line with GDP volumes, which, if you look back over time in this business, it tracks GDP, we've always said, very closely.","So, the volumes are coming back in line from a macro perspective. The inventories, if you look at the inventories, at our customer base, they remain stable and in line with historical levels. From a producer basis, it's unchanged at about 60 days. And that's in line with historical averages as well. So, when you look at these market dynamics and what's going on, you would say that the market dynamics are getting stronger and more back to those normalized levels.","As far as the market price, obviously that's an area we're going to continue to monitor and react as the market allows for price increases to occur. Today, it's essentially flattish. If you look sequentially, it may be down just a hair. But it's sequentially flattish, and year over year it's down about 3%. So, that's an area we'll continue to monitor.","Operator","Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, with regard to the Fresh Start program, at the time, you were looking into it and the analysis that went into it, did you look to see if the various business segment leaders and their divisional teams are, in your opinion, incentivized properly to consistently dig out costs out of their businesses? And for that matter, even to grow them and maximize their performance? Or are there tweaks that you think may need to be made with regard to how each of the business leaders think about their businesses?","Ellen Kullman","Thanks for the question, John. We have streamlined our compensation plans over the last few years, aligning them much more closely with increasing shareholder value \u2013 aligning the business units much more closely with getting paid on their performance. And that's not only top line, but it's heavily bottom line and cash generation. And we have slopes on those curves that are incentivized upside to the plan to go after it.","And we always look at them versus what their competition is doing. What are you doing versus the competition, and understanding where we pegged that plan. So, there's a lot of incentive locally to generate the revenue and the return, and keeping costs in line in order to be able to make their plan and to participate fully in the benefits from that standpoint, from a compensation standpoint.","So, that's one of the first things we looked at coming out of the global financial crisis is, how do we make sure that it is aligned with where we're driving the Company. And I'm really happy with where that is right now.","John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning, folks. Hey, Nick, when you were talking before about the geographic trends, you mentioned that China was actually a bit of a bright spot in Asia. And obviously, we've been hearing of some concerns in the media, et cetera, about the pace of business over there. Could you take a moment or two and walk us through what exactly is going on in that part of the world, and what your expectations are?","Nick Fanandakis","Sure. Well, China volume was up for us about 8%. Sales were up about 5% in the region. All segments really had positive volume there.","PV in China is going to be key to us having a very strong fourth quarter. I think you realize that we're talking about PV industry in the mid-teens in the way of a year-over-year growth. And China probably represents close to half of that, so it's a big part of the overall PV growth. And we're seeing that, and we're expecting that to be strong in the fourth quarter as well.","Auto builds for China were up about 10% in the third quarter; again, strong performance in that regard. And our sales in crop, a 9% increase there, DPT was up, TiO2 was up. So, across the board, we saw increases within the region.","Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","So, what sort of concerns do you have looking out in Q4 and beyond in that area? And I guess on the same token, you mentioned that EMEA is likely to be sluggish over the next three months. What would your thoughts be as you look out into 2015 in that part of the world?","Nick Fanandakis","Well, EMEA is a concern because it is in a very sluggish mode right now. I read reports that say that they might be heading towards the third recession since the global financial crisis. So, all of Europe is a concern for me, and how quickly it's going to stabilize and start to bounce back.","I think EMEA needs a catalyst; it needs a catalyst for growth. And I'm not sure exactly what that catalyst is going to be, but that's going to be necessary to see a turnaround within the region.","Ellen Kullman","Just one thing I would add to that is that automotive has been holding up Europe for a while, and it's hesitated here towards the end of the year a little bit in Europe. And we think, as you take a look at it, they're predicting automotive to be about the same kind of growth next year as they have seen this year. So, that's going to be a key indicator for us on how we take a look at it.","The other thing I would look at is that nutrition and health really is, in China specifically \u2013 I'm back to your China answer \u2013 showing great results. We've invested in plants; we're filling those plants. The probiotics are going very, very well. And they're really doing a great job of penetrating a marketplace in China that is crying out for fine space solutions to deal with safety issues and things like that. So, that's a real positive for us from a China standpoint.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Maybe we could talk a bit about seed input costs for next year. You noted that they were down in the quarter.","And so, just a couple of things on that. Is what you're seeing now \u2013 is that the continued give-back of the price pressures or the cost pressures that came from the 2011 and 2012 drought-type scenario? Or is it you're seeing actually continued relief based on the 2014 harvest, the size of the harvest, and the lower commodity prices?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, I think, as you take a look at it, this all plays together as you go out through time. The input prices were going up, the stocks [to use] were lower. Now that the stocks to use are much higher, those input prices have come down, as we've all seen. And that will have a positive impact on 2015.","This is just one element of many that creates success in that marketplace. But it's one that we actively work and understand how we can make that come out in the right place.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I think, Ellen, you said it was about 100 basis points for 2014, if I'm correct; that was, I think, your last estimate there. Is there any update to that, and should we be expecting about the same in 2015?","Ellen Kullman","I think it's too early to call there. I know we're actively looking at what's coming out of the fields right now and things like that, and what we're doing. And I think we'll able to speak to that with more certainty in the coming weeks and months.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes, a follow-up question on ag, and that's your South American soy strategy. I know you've launched your Dermacor seed treatment this fall. Just wondering what type of market acceptance you're seeing, and longer term, can you meet your growth objectives in South American soy without having access to an INTACTA license?","Ellen Kullman","First, I want to tell you that I'm very pleased with the Dermacor launch, and what we're seeing. We are on over 3 million acres. It's exceeded our expectation, and I think the team down there has done a great job in that marketplace with that.","So, over time, we continue to understand what we require in order to be successful in that marketplace. It's not only around the germplasm and continuing the genetic side of that, where we've made a lot of gains over the last few years. And so, our product portfolio, we continue to drive it, and we'll see where that goes.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","And a follow-up on just consolidation in the agricultural space. There seems to be room for one more large transaction covering both crop protection and seed. What's DuPont's appetite for participating in further major industry consolidation? And are you disadvantaged if you don't participate?","Ellen Kullman","So, we've been very clear around our acquisition strategy, and where we are focused. And ag and nutrition is clearly a focus for us. We understand these marketplaces; we understand the competitive strengths and weaknesses, and our own. And if we ever see that there's an opportunity where there would be benefit to our shareholders by doing something there, we would absolutely drive it.","It is about innovation. It is about connecting to that marketplace. You saw all of the advantages that we've seen from the Pannar acquisition that we completed last year, and that's been a real positive for us. So, we don't believe we're disadvantaged today, but we understand that the market is a very \u2013 that there's a lot of change going on in the marketplace, and we have to be right there with it to understand how we can create more advantage going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Brent crude oil, as you know, is off more than 22% since mid-year. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of that across the portfolio, and in particular, address whether or not you would expect destocking in any product lines? And also whether or not \u2013 it looks to be a record margin in performance materials in the quarter \u2013 whether you would view that as sustainable with the high end of the global cost curve coming down overseas for some competitors?","Ellen Kullman","Thanks, Kevin. Oil does have an impact on us. Not as big as it used to with our changing portfolio. It basically impacts us in performance materials, and safety and protection.","It's coming down. Will we see relief on some raw material streams that are greatly impacted it, and there will be maybe a tailwind there from a 2015 standpoint.","Our performance materials margins are industry-leading. But we do understand that there is a component of that that has to do with not only the productivity that we're driving, but low-cost natural gas and record ethylene costs.","So, we do think that there's a parallel impact, not only to oil, but to natural gas, and we'll see where that comes off. But ethylene will change over time, and we have to comprehend that in our future plans. But we continue to watch this and drive it from a very disciplined standpoint.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","As a follow-up, if I may, on the Trian proposal, I think they have estimated excess costs of $2 billion to $4 billion. Do you have any reaction to that? Do you consider it reasonable or unreasonable?","And in their proposed scenario, what would be the dis-synergies of separating the Company in a wholesale fashion, in terms of tax, and financing, and excess overhead, et cetera \u2013 any thoughts on that?","Ellen Kullman","Well, let me start by saying that we've been very focused on productivity and from a total cost standpoint for a number of years. If you look just from 2008 to today, we've taken out more than $2 billion in costs through our productivity efforts. And you've heard me speak before that we're never done.","Obviously, like with just wage inflation, there's hundreds of millions of dollars that comes in to our expense line every year that we have to offset that, and we have to continue to drive because our marketplaces are very competitive. So, productivity is a focus for us.","We announced earlier this year, the $1 billion \u2013 at least $1 billion from the project Fresh Start. We're continuing to look at how we structure and support our businesses to succeed in the marketplace, and do it in a very efficient manner. And it's a focus area for us.","So, I'm not sure how the $2 billion to $4 billion was exactly calculated. Sales is a very important marketing or a very important cost for us, not only as R&D but in that as well. But we're continuing to engage to understand and see whether there are our other ideas out there because we know, in a competitive marketplace, we have to be very cost effective to be successful. And not only be a great innovator, but be very cost effective.","Greg Friedman","John, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And it\u2019s from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS","Thank you. Could you give us an update on the Mexican TiO2 expansion plans? And given the market has continued to be soft there, how do you plan to ramp that capacity?","Ellen Kullman","Well, there hasn't been any real change to the timing on that. As you know, we benefit from a very unique technology position that allows us to utilize a wide range of inputs from ores. This enables us to dial down capacity and lower costs \u2013 dial up capacity.","And depending on where the market is, it's hard to predict right now where TiO2 will be when that comes on. But we will act appropriately given the dynamics of the market, and make sure that that business is delivering against its commitments to our shareholders.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS","Quick follow-up: Nick, did you give a foreign exchange guidance for next year yet? If rates stay where they are, I know you gave the fourth quarter, but what's the headwind for full-year 2015 at the current level?","Nick Fanandakis","John, I did not give that. And what I did say is that it's way too soon for me to predict what the headwind on that would be.","Greg Friedman","Great. And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for dialing in today. The IR team and I are available to answer any follow-up questions. So, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may all disconnect at this time."],"8180":["E I du Pont de Nemours and Co (NYSE:DD) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Greg Friedman - VP, IR","Nick Fanandakis - EVP and CFO","Ed Breen - Interim Chair & CEO","Jim Borel - EVP, Agriculture and Nutrition & Health Segments","Analysts","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C.

The name is John and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Now I will turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of investor relations. Greg you may begin.","Greg Friedman","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's third quarter 2015 performance. Joining me are Ed Breen, interim chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President responsible for our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments.","The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release. During the course of the conference call we will make forward-looking statements and I direct you to slide 1 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.","Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risk and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliation to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides which are posted on our website.","For today's agenda Nick will review our third quarter financial performance and Ed will provide concluding remarks followed by your questions. With that introduction it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you, Greg. Overall third quarter results were consistent with the update provided on our October 5 call. Our bottom line continued to benefit from the positive effects of our operational redesign and cost reductions in the quarter including lower performance-based compensation.","More than offsetting these benefits, however, were negative impacts from currency challenges in ag markets, particularly in Brazil and continued weakness in emerging markets and oil and gas markets affecting Safety & Protection. These pressures increase our resolve to continue to deploy disciplined cost and working capital management to deliver value to our shareholders. Ed and I are working closely with business and functional leaders on our plan to accelerate and expand our targeted cost savings commitment. We're evaluating all opportunities to improve cost and working capital performance.","Now let's start with the details of the quarter on slide 2. Operating earnings per share were $0.13 versus $0.39 in the prior year. Segment results declined $0.22 per share in the quarter including a $0.17 per share negative impact from currency, primarily the Brazilian real.","Also negatively impacting the quarter was $0.08 per share from a higher tax rate which I'll describe in detail in a few moments. Year-to-date operating earnings per share were $2.49 versus $2.79 in the prior year. Currency negatively impacted results by $0.53 per share. Excluding the impact of currency year-to-date operating earnings per share would have increased by 8%. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $4.9 billion a decline of 17% versus the prior year, eight percentage points of that decline were due to currency.","The dollar remains strong relative to most other currencies particularly the Brazilian real. The challenging ag market in Brazil was the primary driver of the 7% volume decline in the quarter from lower seed volume and reduced demand for insect control products. However, in Agriculture we're progressing well in our limited launch of Leptra corn hybrids for the upcoming Safrinha season with an aggressive ramp up planned for our 2016 Summer season. We did see volume growth in the quarter in Industrial Biosciences on the increased demand for enzymes and biomaterials.","Turning now to slide 3. Currency continued to be a significant headwind to segment results in the quarter. Segment results excluding currency were down $0.05 per share year over year, primarily due to decline in Agriculture Performance Materials and Safety & Protection. As I mentioned a higher tax rate negatively impacted operating earnings per share in the quarter. Our expected geographic mix of earnings influences our base income tax rate. In the third quarter a shift to higher percentage of earnings in the U.S. versus prior year resulted in a significantly higher tax rate. Net after-tax exchange gains and losses were also a $0.02 headwind in the quarter.","Lower corporate costs and interest expense provided a $0.06 benefit in the quarter reflecting disciplined spending and continued productivity. As I noted, we continue to see the results of our operational redesign benefiting the bottom line.","Turning now to slide 4, I would like to highlight some of the geographic results. As you can see our geographic mix of sales continued to shift year over year to a higher percentage of reported sales occurring in the U.S. and Canada. In the third quarter the shift was led by the overall decline in sales in Latin America as a result of currency and weakness in agricultural markets.","While the region was down overall due to currency, a highlight in the third quarter was organic growth in developing EMEA. Now let's turn to the third quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide 5. As you can see on the slide operating earnings growth in the Electronics & Communications, Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in the remaining segments.","Electronics & Communications results demonstrated continued productivity and cost reductions. Volume growth in Kevlar film and consumer electronics was more than offset a competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste. In Industrial Biosciences operating earnings grew 24% on strong volume growth, cost reductions and continued productivity improving operating margins by 360 basis points.","Volume growth was led by solid demand for enzymes in food and home and personal care as well as improved demand for biomaterials. Nutrition & Health improvement resulted from cost reductions and continued productivity which more than offset negative currency. Strong growth in probiotics, ingredient systems and texturants was offset by volume -- lower volumes due to competitive challenges in specialty proteins. Operating margins in the segment improved 160 basis points and have now grown year over year for nine consecutive quarters.","In Agriculture near-term conditions remain challenging. Demand for seed and crop protection products primarily in Brazil further weakened in the quarter impacted by macroeconomic and competitive pressures. In Brazil where the planting season is in progress tighter grower profits and credits are causing growers to be more cautious in their spending. The seasonal loss in third quarter was $154 million larger than the prior year as improved productivity, cost reductions and higher global price were more than offset by lower volumes, currency and the impact of the LaPorte manufacturing facility shutdown.","The shutdown of the LaPorte facility impacted operating earnings for the quarter by about $40 million. And on a year-to-date basis by about $90 million. Our view of the season in Brazil remains consistent with what we communicated on October 5. Performance Materials operating earnings were down as cost reductions and continued productivity were more than offset by negative currency and lower ethylene prices and volume. Average ethylene spot prices were down 60% year over year and our significantly impacting topline and bottom line segment results.","Third quarter operating earnings for Safety & Protection declined as cost reductions, productivity improvements and increased demand for Tyvek protective material and medical packaging are more than offset by negative currency, lower demand from oil and gas and military markets and higher costs associated with continued operational issues at our Chambers works facility. Our team is fully dedicated to resolving these issues.","Lower demand from oil and gas and military markets impacted sales in Nomex thermal apparel, Kevlar high-strength materials and sustainable solutions offerings. As a reminder the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor center website under events and presentations. I encourage you to refer to those slides for further details on segment results including our expectations for the fourth quarter.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 6. Our free cash flow for the first nine months of 2015 is about even with last year and reflects our expected seasonal working capital needs. Lower cash earnings were offset by related improvements in working capital. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate seasonal cash inflow in the fourth quarter.","Net debt at September 30 reflects our normal seasonal pattern of cash flows. In the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to enable our $2 billion share repurchase commitment for 2015. In the quarter we received and retired an initial delivery of about 29 million shares which represents 80% of our $2 billion commitment. We expect final settlements of the ASR in the fourth quarter. We estimate that average diluted shares outstanding for the full year will be 900 million shares and about 880 million for the fourth quarter.","Consistent with our previous statements we expect to return an additional $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchase in 2016. On slide 7, we're continuing to execute our operational redesign which delivered approximately $0.10 of incremental value in the third quarter and is on track to deliver about $0.40 of incremental savings in 2015. Cost reductions and continued productivity were key drivers of the results for the quarter resulting in operating margin improvement in four of our six operating segments, invisible in an over $150 million reduction in selling general and administrative and R&D costs versus our prior year. DuPont remains committed to our dividend. Last week we announced our 445th consecutive quarterly dividend since 1904.","Our intent is to continue to grow our dividend in line with future operating earnings growth. On slide eight, we're reaffirming our outlook for 2015 operating earnings per share of approximately $2.75 reflecting continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus currencies in emerging markets, weak agricultural markets primarily in Brazil and continued weakness in emerging markets.","Our guidance assumes a full-year currency impact of $0.72 per share. Excluding the impact of currency, the outlook for full-year operating earnings per share including benefits from share repurchase and cost savings represents a 3% increase year over year. For the full year we continue to expect our base tax rate to be about 22% based on our anticipated geographic mix of earnings and the assumption of the re-enactments of the U.S. tax extenders in the fourth quarter.","With that let me turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Breen","Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. This is my first DuPont earnings call and I am honored to have been selected to lead this great company during this period. My immediate priority is to DuPont successfully through the current challenging time to assure we can capitalize fully on our next phase of growth and innovation. DuPont is a great company with many competitive advantages.","The company has made huge progress through a broad transformation over several years, but we have a lot more work to do. The increasingly challenging environment of the past few months clearly presents new hurdles and my immediate priority is to guide DuPont successfully through this period. Since I took on the role of interim chair and CEO on October 16, we have been taking a hard look at our cost structure our working capital performance and our capital spending.","While it is too early in our process to share a specific plan and metrics, we see opportunities for further improvement in all three areas and we're working quickly with a sense of urgency. We will finalize these plans in the fourth quarter. Cost is one of the biggest levers we can control. We can't precisely predict how long pressures from currency, ag challenges, reduced global production and a slowdown in emerging markets may continue. But as we aggressively address the fundamentals, cost, working capital performance and capital spending we will assure that our cost actions will result in a significant net benefit for the bottom line.","We're looking at every investment to ensure that we maximize our returns. This increased rigor will also improve our cash position and ultimately enable us to emerge even stronger. For me this deep dive is an essential first step to developing the right plan to deliver a sustainable improvement in shareholder value. There is more than one route to long-term shareholder value and each situation is unique.","I have always looked at each situation with an open mind and a commitment to effective decision-making based on the specific facts and circumstances. At General Instrument I drove an organic growth strategy over many years. Tycho was a very different situation that required a focus on cost efficiencies, restructuring and divestitures.","As I have said before, I will work with the board and management team to carefully determine the best way to create greater sustainable value for our shareholders. As we do this work I have been struck by how seriously the entire team takes its responsibilities to our shareholders and how much this team wants to win, that's why I'm confident we will deliver.","Now let me turn it back to Greg.","Greg Friedman","Thanks, Ed. We will now open the line for questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Ed, I was wondering as interim CEO are you a candidate to be a non-interim CEO? Or are you not a candidate?","Ed Breen","Jeff, the Board is going through a process as we speak. I don't think process will be much longer. I will say the Board knows that I am fully engaged. I have been around for three weeks. I've been working seven days a week on DuPont and I just talked to the Board at the end of the week and told them how excited I am and that I see more opportunity than when I arrived just three weeks ago and we're going to get to it and start getting some things done.","Jeff Zekauskas","For my follow-up is really a question about your safety and protection business. That business fell very, very sharply in the third quarter and I think you expect it to be relatively flat in the fourth. But business conditions in oil and gas probably are not so different. So what is the lever that will make the third quarter level of profits rise so sharply in the fourth quarter?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, Jeff, let me answer that. It's Nick. When you look at the third quarter, let's clear the deck on that one. The currency was a part of that. You had about six points of the drop that occurred in S&P was related to currency. As you look at the market space, military market was lighter than anticipated. And the demand being off there impact of the Kevlar business, oil and gas prices did impact several businesses within S&P not only the Nomex business but also on our safety solutions business as well.","And then we also had some operating problems at chambers works that impacted the quarter as well. As we go forward into the fourth quarter, we do see those operating issues being addressed and we also see some of the military market tenders picking up as well.","Operator","Our next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citi.","PJ Juvekar","Question on Pioneer, Pioneer has always lagged in trade development. Would you be willing to take view that finance should focus on seeds and licensing on the trait and stop spending on trade R&D.","Jim Borel","PJ, this is Jim Borel. First of all I think it's important for us to be able to have some discovery effort of our own, but we're very open to also end licensing and we'd certainly end licensed a number of trades over the years and we end up using this tool of bio technology and a lot of different aspects of our research effort, not just around trait discovery, but we've developed a real competitive advantage around trait introgression and getting a final product that combines trait genetics kinetics and traits that perform well in the yield. We think our investment in biotech research as it's deployed makes sense.","PJ Juvekar","Ed, there's a debate out there with the investor economy in the U.S. whether there's a recession or not, DuPont brought genetics products into different industrial end markets was wondering where you stand of the debate. Thank you.","Ed Breen","I mean look, things have clearly softened up, just look at every industrial company that's reported this quarter. Having said that, I don't think things are in any draconian situation. I think it's just a low growth to no growth environment across some of the industrial spaces, that's fine. We can operate well in that environment if we do the right things at our end that we need to do and when things pick up that's great everybody. But, no, I don't see a disaster out there by any means. But I think we're in a kind of zero growth environment when you put all the pieces together and that's fine. There's a lot we can do that's in our control.","Operator","And our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Ed, I was wondering if you might have any perspective to -- a lot of the flack I hear from investors is around the returns on your overall R&D investment and I'm just curious if you have any thoughts or strategies on how you might better relay successes or failures or return on that pretty substantial R&D spend every year.","Ed Breen","Look, I think overall this is one of the areas I have been -- one of the three key areas I've been digging into very significantly. I think we can have a better rigor around our return metrics across all of our products and platforms and programs that we're working on. So we're clearly on instituting that. So I don't just highlight that to R&D. I think that's across the board on how we spend on CapEx and certainly R&D is a big piece of that, but it's across the board. I think more rigor around R&D is needed. Having said that, R&D is one of the great strength this company, but more rigor around that and that process I think could be very helpful for us and we're starting to put some more of that in place.","Operator","And our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Ed a lot has been written and speculated that your appointment may be signaling that the company would be broken up by -- written and speculated by others I should say. And I'm just trying to get a sense from you given the fact you've been on the Board now nine months. How do you think about the debate in terms of the sit of ag in side of the broader DuPont portfolio?","Ed Breen","That's why I highlighted my prior career. I've had two very distinct paths that we created significant value at both. One happened to be a split up that obviously worked very well. The other was not a split up at all. It was a growth strategy with assets that we had that also worked extremely well. So I come in with a very open mind.","Having said that, I'm not naive about what's going on in the ag space right now. I do think at some point there's consolidation here that will occur. You saw some other announcements just this week from others. And so we need to be very cognizant of that and clearly -- let me just say it this way. We will do what's right for our shareholders no matter what form factor that takes. If we have something that will create significant value for our shareholders moving forward, we will seriously be looking at it.","Frank Mitsch","And obviously speaking of ag it is a very difficult ag environment with virtually every large company opining on how difficult it is. How should we think about it in 2016? There's been a lot written about crop protection chemical inventories and so forth. Are we set up for another difficult year and in fact one that's likely to be lower than 2015 as some others have speculated?","Jim Borel","Frank, this is Jim Borel. I think the way I'd say that is were certainly taking a cautious view of 2016. We're not expecting a big market recovery overnight. So -- but we'll talk more about the 2016 outlook and we get ready to talk about the 2016 plan.","Operator","And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Ed, in your brief time as CEO in long time as Board member, what do you think DuPont does well and what do you think DuPont does not as well.","Ed Breen","I love that question. There are so many great things here and I told the employees that were really working off a very solid foundation. First of all I've been in many companies and the one thing I can say is the employees are really dedicated. As I said in my prepared comments, they want to win. So there is a great spirit here and a great drive and you can't make up for that. I've been in other situations where that's not the case. I think there's two other pillars I would mention.","Obviously this is a great science and R&D company and a lot of great things come through that. And this company is also very focused on its customers with an extensive global sales force that really is very impressive. So that's a great foundation to have. The areas where I think there's improvement needed are more operational. At this point time anyway especially with the environment we're in, I think there's a nice opportunity on the cost side.","This company has an overhead structure all cost from everywhere is about $7 billion. That's R&D, that's sales, it's marketing, that's G&A expand, it's corporate expand. That's a big number. And there's ways to strategically reduce that more so on the G&A side by the way, because what we don't want to do is we don't want to hurt at all our growth potential and volume potential over time. So that's what we're working our way through.","That clearly needs improvement and I've felt that way, by the way, as a Board member and now certainly kind of confirming that my first few weeks here. I also think from a CapEx standpoint we've been spending around $1.5 billion a year. I think that number is too high. We've pretty much zeroed in on what our numbers going to be for 2016.","I will hold off on that until we give some more guidance on 2016, but we've work our way through that nicely and that gets back to a rigor around returns on invested capital and what programs really makes sense which ones are marginal. And we're going to do a lot that have great returns with them. And I'd say the other area where there's improvement needed is working capital.","If you look at DuPont right now and if you just took the metrics we had last year of working capital versus the deterioration we've had this year, there wouldn't be additional $500 million coming our way in cash. And that would be just the benchmark to our last year performance. If you look at benchmarking of the best of the peers, there's a much larger opportunity than the $500 million and that's what we're going to get at also.","David Begleiter","And, Jim just for you on the upcoming ag consolidation. How do you see it playing out and maybe of the big six that exist today, what's the number we get going forward is it three is it four? What are your thoughts on how it plays out?","Ed Breen","This is Ed. Let me take a cut at that. Who knows how fast it happens, but you've seen all the activity in the last six months and one of the other ag players just this week saying they are looking at what they would do with their ag business and I'd also say one of them said everyone's talking to everyone. That's a true statement and we're also -- I am personally talking to the CEOs of some of the other companies. Something will give here on the ag side and I would say just looking at it consolidation should happen. So clearly we will make sure we have our -- our nose in the tent to see if there's anything that makes great sense for our shareholders.","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Can I just ask a follow up on some of these ag consolidation questions. It sounds like, Ed, you'd intimating you'd actually be a seller of ag in the event there was a compelling value proposition for shareholders versus keeping it. Is that a correct statement?","Ed Breen","Let me answer it this way. We will do what's right for our shareholders to create value for them. That's lasting value. Not for some overnight pop but something that creates long-term value for our shareholders. We certainly have a fiduciary responsibility to look at it as a management team and a Board and we will do that.","Vincent Andrews","If I could just ask on the Laporte costs, you said $90 million year-to-date and it sounds like there are going to be some incremental costs in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how that's going to flow into 2016? Do you have any sense of when you might be a little restart that facility? Or should we just be carrying through, sounds like maybe $120 million in cost into next year.","Jim Borel","This is Jim Borel. We're working with the regulatory agencies, various agencies that are involved. And that's really the pacing item. And so it's difficult to say exactly when it'll start up, but I can tell you that as soon as all the actions are taken, we will be ready to start up as quickly as that's all cleared. But certainly you're right, we expect the impact to continue at least through the fourth quarter and we'll see where we go after that. One good thing is we continue to see demand in the marketplace for the products that we would make there, so we expect once again start up for things to spring back very quickly.","Vincent Andrews","But there is no volumetric hit from the plant shutdown?","Jim Borel","The products we were making there, yes, have been part of the negative impact on sales and crop protection. Is that your question? There was volume that we lost as part of that.","Operator","And our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","Question for you, Ed. When you're looking at the company for five years from now having done all the cost cutting and all the improvements in R&D and everything, where do you see growth really being reignited? Are you thinking of basically taking the DuPont that is today and supercharging it or are you thinking of other areas to add on like DuPont has done in the past?","Ed Breen","It's probably too early for me to comment on that. But look, the time I've been here I think there's a lot of great growth opportunity the least of which is ag coming back here at some point. We're sort of like everyone counting on softer 2016, but when you look at ag and nutrition it's almost kind of half the company.","So and we're in the bottom of the down cycle right now or hopefully close to it. So clearly there's a big opportunity there. And everyone's seen that. I've been operating reviews with all the businesses. I think they have great growth plans. We're continuing those growth plans.","We're funding them. I've been pretty clear that were not -- when we look at our cost cuts, we're not looking at stopping the projects at all that will be part of our future to grow the business. Our look is much more surgical and strategic where we can get, let's say a little bit of slop out of the system. So I think we have great opportunities across all of our businesses. We're not going to impinge on that growth opportunity as we go through some downsizing and streamlining.","Jonas Oxgaard","And as a follow-up on that are there pieces that you're looking at not fitting into the DuPont portfolio at this point?","Ed Breen","We're doing a strategic review obviously of the company kind of parallel with my comments on all the cost, the CapEx, working capital, kind of the operating performance of the company. We actually just had a Board meeting at the end of last week. We spent a lot of time on strategy and I won't comment past that, but we're very engaged on that side.","Operator","And our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler","I wonder if we could back up for a moment on some of the cost efficiency work since the original operational redesign initiatives are starting to overlap with some of these fresh programs. What's the expected run rate that will compare -- the expected run rate in 2015 that will compared to the $1.3 billion run rate at the end of 2016.","Ed Breen","I think I understand the question. At the end when we come out with a new program which we will have done in the fourth quarter, that will be the amount incremental amount that we're going to capture during 2016 that will be off the baseline of where we end 2015.","So when we talk to you about that you'll clearly understand where the numbers ended for 2015 and what we communicate to you will be the number that will be the cost opportunity we will be addressing 2016. And let me clarify that, the number at the end of this year is $1 billion from the first fresh start program is where we will end up. So it will be off of that base.","Mike Ritzenthaler","Yes. Okay. I think I have that clearly. And just a question on ag maybe more for Jim I guess. As challenging as that market has been, Pioneer's competitors have been recently pounding their chest about market share gains in corn. And is that a Pioneers expense or is it domestic genetics? Then maybe as a subtlety in there, are there particular products, the Leptra product is one that's coming out next year or are expected to grow significantly in 2016, but are there particular products coming into Brazil to kind of shore up that market share?","Nick Fanandakis","So in North America we held market share in corn so the team did a great job in the season. Plus the farmers saw great results from the new products and hybrids that we were bringing out last year. So we've got a strong position there. As it relates to Brazil, the issue we've had down there has been the Herculex resistance that we talked about before.","And as you mentioned Leptra starts to come in in a limited way and that's a premium market with an expected rapid ramp in the summer season next year. And that we think it's going to help restore our competitive position, because that product is on top of some very strong genetics that we have already down there. We have -- we're optimistic about getting back into that market in a strong way.","Operator","Your next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Ed, a question going back to the portfolio. In the past DuPont's justified having this very diversified portfolio, because there were ostensibly links between the different businesses on the R&D side. Do you see those links as justifying the diverse portfolio?","Ed Breen","I do see those links. I spent half a day two weeks ago over at our main R&D lab, our experimental station. There is a lot of work going on. I'd say it's cross pollinating, so no I clearly see that. And that's a great thing. I'll go back to my original comment though.","You just never know where there's opportunity to create value and you just have to assess those things against whether opportunity might arise and always answer what's the best thing for our shareholders. And that's how we'll look at things. Clearly there is linkage. There's some very impressive work going on there.","Don Carson","As a follow-up just on the dividend. Prior to the Camorra's spin DuPont was paying about $1.7 billion annually. You allocated $400 million of that to Chemours which was clearly above what they could sustain at the bottom of the cycle. And they've since cut. So effectively if you're a DuPont holder you've seen a significant cut in your dividend if you've held both stocks. Any plans to rectify that on the part of DuPont and return the yield that to close to what it was?","Ed Breen","We're not going to address our dividend based on what Chemours did. We will make our own independent decisions. We're two separate companies and we will base our decisions on our own analysis.","Operator","And our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wanted to understand a little bit more on the commentary in the release. So when you see more focus on CapEx allocation and cost reductions and you also noted that the opportunity maybe bigger than when you are on the Board, can you quantify what that could be? Is it $200 million, $300 million more to the $1.3 billion that you've outlined or could it be even greater than that.","Ed Breen","There is still more cost reduction happening during the quarter we're in right now, so you should count on that occurring as we communicated to get you to a run rate savings on all fresh start of $1 billion. So that is continuing and then in the fourth quarter we will be communicating with you about our future plans on cost reduction. At that point in time we will size what that opportunity is and again that opportunity will be something we will accomplish in 2016. It won't be a multi-year. It will be what we're going to accomplish it in 2016.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay and just as a follow-up. Do you foresee a lot of other changes either in management or in headcount in order to affect some of that increased cost reduction. Thanks.","Ed Breen","As I said some of that cost reduction will come from the G&A line. So you can take that how you want. That's clearly an area we need to streamline in the company. In fact a lot of corporate America has been streamlining in that area, because it's not affecting your growth within your customer focus and your R&D. So a higher portion of it will obviously come from areas like that.","Operator","And it's from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","You commented on some weakening in the consumer electronics markets where you're seeing a little bit of a slowdown. I understand some of that's in China. Could you just give some more color on consumer electronics end markets where you're seeing that and did that continue in October?","Nick Fanandakis","This is Nick. Jim when you look at electronics communications, consumer electronics was actually a strength in the quarter as was our Kevlar film business and the PV. Where the drop-off occurred was in the Solamet paste, also in the PV industry and largely service in AP, specifically China region. That's where the greatest year-over-year decline occurred within the business.","Jim Sheehan","And with respect to your Nutrition & Health segment, I was wondering if you could give us some broader comments on when do you expect to reach your longer-term targets in that business?","Nick Fanandakis ","The Nutrition & Health business has been making very consistent progress and we expect that to continue and I think it's what the ninth quarter of expanding margin. So the business is growing faster than the market and we expect that to continue indefinitely and they've got a lot of room for continued market expansion over the foreseeable future. So I'm not going to predict a plateau. We're expecting continued progress.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of the call and I will now turn it back over to Greg Friedman for closing remarks.","Greg Friedman","Great. Well, thank you very much for joining our third quarter earnings call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the investor relations team and we look forward to connecting with you again as we close the year.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The slides for today\u2019s presentation can be found on our website along with our news release. Please note that we have also posted our fourth quarter segment performance slides and outlook commentary this morning.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

We will conclude with Ellen\u2019s comments and then follow with your questions.","With that introduction, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","","Ellen Kullman","Great, thank you Carl and good morning and thank all of you for joining us. I am pleased to review DuPont\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance. We closed 2013 with strong fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 6%. Segment operating earnings grew 52%. Our margin improved almost 400 basis points. And operating earnings per share of $0.59 was nearly triple last year. Results came in largely as expected and communicated to you three months ago. Most of our businesses grew revenue and earnings. The exception as anticipated was our Performance Chemical segment, although the trends there are clearly positive.","We posted a fourth quarter operating earnings profit in our Ag segment, which as you know, historically records a seasonal loss at this time of the year. Our Nutrition & Health segment grew earnings 40%. Safety & Protection grew 57%. Electronics & Communication more than doubled its operating earnings. Segment earnings growth and margin improvement were driven by new product sales, higher volumes, improved plant utilization rates, good cost control and productivity gains. Demand for products was higher in key industries and across all regions. Demand from automotive and industrial markets was better than earlier in the year. Demand from food ingredients markets were stable and we saw clear signs of a recovery in the photovoltaic principally in China.","In Ag demand for our insecticides was very strong in Latin America driven by heavy insect pressure and the excellent performance of Rynaxypyr. Nick will take you through our fourth quarter financials next. So let me focus now on our full year performance. Our 2013 revenue growth of 3% and operating earnings growth of 3% overcame significant price declines and market disruptions in the global TiO2 market. This resulted in performance chemical segment operating earnings declining 45% or $0.66 per share overshadowing the strong performance of our other businesses. Aside from Performance Chemicals our combined businesses in a sluggish global economy grew revenues 5% while delivering 11% earnings growth much more in-line with our long term target growth rates of 7% and 12% and our operating margins increased about a 100 basis point to 16.8%.","Importantly these businesses delivered solid results by continuing to execute well against our strategic and operational priorities. Specifically regarding innovation our integrated customer centric innovation teams connected with our exceptional science resources to deliver a steady stream of new products. For the year we introduced 1753 new products and our market winning products like Optimum AcreMax technologies, Optimum AQUAmax hybrids, Rynaxypyr insecticides and Solamet paste contributed to market share gains. Regarding global reach, our volume growth in developing markets was 11% in the fourth quarter and for the year as we successfully leveraged our market positions. For productivity we exceeded our goals including residual cost elimination for the year and as you know from our announcements we move decisively forward in 2013 to reshape our portfolio for higher growth.","In February, we completed the $5 billion divesture of Performance Coatings. In July, we acquired the controlling interest in Pannar Seed in South Africa. In October we announced the decision to separate our $7 billion Performance Chemicals segment and in November we announced that we had signed definitive agreements to sell glass laminating solutions and vinyls a part of the packaging and industrial polymers business in Performance Materials.","These events followed our 2011 Danisco acquisition and they are all integral sets of our plan to refine our portfolio and deliver higher and less cyclical growth. In 2013 we raised our dividend 5% for the second consecutive year and we executed a $1 billion share buyback. Today, we announce that our Board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program and that we expect to complete $2 billion this year. Nick will provide more details about the program.","With that I will turn it over to Nick and Carl and then I will come back to address 2014. Nick?","","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you Ellen and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with the details of the quarter on slide 3. As Ellen indicated we had a strong fourth quarter with operating earnings per share up a 195% almost triple a weak fourth quarter last year. In agricultural strong insecticide sales growth in Latin America coupled with earlier seed shipments for the safrinha corn season in Brazil and earlier seed shipments in North America contributed to our positive earnings for the segment. In electronics and communications operating earnings more than doubled last year on higher operating margins fueled by stronger demand for Solamet paste and Tedlar Films improbable [ph] tax. Likewise, higher margins in Safety & Protection were driven by improved demand for Kevlar and Nomex fibers. In fact, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement in Safety & Protection. Operating earnings in this segment were up 57% and we saw continued productivity gains.","Finally, in Nutrition & Health, operating earnings increased 40% due to improved pricing and stronger demand for cultures, probiotics and specialty proteins. Consolidated net sales of $7.7 billion were up 6% versus the prior year. Volume increased 9% led by Electronics & Communication, which grew volumes 17%. In Agriculture, volumes grew 14% reflecting the earlier timing of seed shipments that we anticipated. Weaker local pricing of 2% in the quarter was primarily driven by Performance Chemicals and significantly lower pass-through metals pricing in Electronics & Communications.","From a currency perspective, the dollar continued to strengthen against most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and the Japanese yen. This impact however was partially offset by weaker dollar versus the euro. The net result was a $0.04 hurt for the quarter. For the full year, currency was a $0.15 per share headwind versus last year. In 2013, we delivered solid revenue growth, double-digit operating earnings growth in three of our segments and operating margin improvement in five segments. However, these gains were largely offset by the steep 45% or $0.66 per share decline we experienced in our Performance Chemical segment earnings as a result of the significantly lower global TiO2 prices throughout 2013.","For the full year, our 20.8% base tax rate was about 1 point lower than the base tax rate we anticipated three months ago and more than 3 points lower than the prior year. This lower rate in 2013 primarily results from the favorable geographic mix of earnings. Additionally, our base tax rate for 2013 was favorably impacted by the inclusion of the U.S. R&D credit and other U.S. business tax provisions that were reenacted in the first quarter of 2013. The significantly lower fourth quarter rate reflects a year-to-date catch-up adjustment to our full year base tax rate of 20.8%.","Turning now to Slide 4, I would like to highlight some of our geographic results. Sales in developing markets increased 9% during the quarter on 11% higher volume. Sales in developing EMEA increased 16% in the quarter versus fourth quarter 2012 where our acquisition of Pannar Seeds in South Africa contributed favorably to the growth as we broadened our geographic footprint. In Latin America, sales grew 8% on 12% higher volume, where demand for our insecticides was very strong. In developing Asia, sales grew 6% in the quarter on 13% higher volumes.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis shown on Slide 5. You can see clearly here the strong performance we had across all of our segments. You can also see that in the fourth quarter we had only a slight decline in Performance Chemicals versus the prior year. In a few minutes, Carl will provide you more details for each of these segments.","Turning now to Slide 6, you can see the major contributions of the year-over-year change. Strong segment results contributed $0.26 higher operating earnings in the quarter and this includes the decline from Performance Chemicals and the $0.04 currency hurt. The lower base tax rate provided an $0.11 benefit in the quarter versus 2012, a few cents better than we had anticipated in October. The favorable variance in corporate expenses provided a benefit of $0.03 in the quarter reflecting ongoing cost control in our support functions. Let me also point out here that we met the $300 million in savings that we targeted for 2013 for the program including the successful elimination of corporate residual cost that were left following the Performance Coatings divestiture.","As previously communicated we highlighted the overhang in corporate cost so that our progress to eliminate them could be easily tracked by our investors. In addition we met our fixed cost and working capital productivity targets. In total both the 2012 restructuring and the fixed cost and working capital initiatives contributed significantly to offsetting inflation and helping to fund our growth investments. Moreover we expect to continue to deliver ongoing productivity in 2014.","Turning now to the balance sheet in cash on slide 7. We ended the year with 1.3 billion of free cash flow on a total company basis versus 3.1 billion last year. This decline primarily reflects changes in working capital in our Ag segment and the lower Performance Chemicals earnings along with the absence of Performance Coatings earnings in 2013 following our divestiture. Capital expenditures were up modestly from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We ended 2013 with a net debt of 3.4 billion which was 4 billion less than our position in December 2012.","Year-end cash balances increased to about $9 billion as anticipated. Let me also point out here that our unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities decreased nearly $5 billion from 13 billion last year to 8 billion now. We had previously communicated to you that we expected the unfunded liabilities to decrease $2 billion to $3 billion. However the impact of the higher discount rate and higher than projected trust asset returns including the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter brought our unfunded pension and OPEB liability down even more than we had anticipated. As a result we have significantly improved the strength of our balance sheet.","Turn now to slide 8, I would like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2014. These highlights from the foundation for our 2014 guidance. Broadly speaking we expect global growth of about 3% against the backdrop of a world economy that continues to face many uncertainties.","We expect global industrial production to increase about 4% in 2014. We see signs of recovery in Europe and Japan with growth firming in China. In agriculture the fundamentals are healthy and we anticipate lower planned [ph] acres that will favor soybeans versus corn. As commodity prices transition off their 2012 peak. Auto and housing are also expected to improve.","With this background now let\u2019s turn to slide 9, we expect 4% revenue growth in 2014 to about $37 billion this includes nearly a 2% decline from portfolio changes. Our outlook for operating earnings per share is $4.20 to $4.45 up 8% to 15% from 2013. This takes into account the fourth quarter early seed shipments highlighted in our news release and anticipates a slight reduction in diluted shares outstanding by year-end. For the full year we expect our base tax rate to be about 22% and capital expenditures to be about equal to last year at $1.9 billion. Pharmaceutical royalties will be minimal this year so beginning in 2014 they will be reported as part of other. In our reporting similar to 2013 non-operating pension expense will be excluded from operating earnings. We anticipate these expenses will be about $0.09 per share for the company compared to $0.39 last year. As mentioned previously the significant reduction in 2014 is due to the higher discount rate and higher pension asset returns achieved in 2013. It is exactly this level of volatility that prompted our decision to exclude non-operating pension and OPEB from our operating results.","Also in 2014, in order to provide you a clear understanding of the underlying performance of our segments, we will exclude from operating earnings the transaction-related costs of the separation of Performance Chemicals and report to them on Schedule B of our earnings report. Be assured that separation work is well underway and we intend to provide you with a full year estimate of these costs later in the year.","Turning now to Slide 10. I will cover a few details about share repurchase announcement this morning. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program of the company\u2019s common stock. While the program is not time-limited, we intend to complete $2 billion this year. Assuming today\u2019s price and expected dilution from benefit plans, we have assumed that the current year repurchase will reduce diluted shares outstanding at year end by about 1% to 1.5% taking into account the averaging of the shares each quarter and for the year.","We expect to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter with the impact on fully diluted average shares occurring across the remaining quarters. We planned to fund the repurchase from our current cash balance and we\u2019ll update you as we execute against this program. Our new $5 billion program, as I said, is not time-limited or restricted to dilution and replaces our previous $2 billion program from 2011, which still had $1.7 billion outstanding. Most important, we believe this repurchase while meaningful in amount is a measured approach that takes into consideration our improved balance sheet position and adheres to our financial disciplines while at the same time providing us with the flexibility for making investments that support growth in our businesses.","We believe this share buyback program was part of a continued commitment to provide attractive cash returns to our shareholders. And today\u2019s announcement reflects the confidence that we have in our plan to build a higher growth, higher value company. Our market environment continues to be a dynamic one and looking back at 2013 we overcame significant TiO2 and currency headwinds. And looking forward in 2014, we see continued gradual sequential improvements in the economy and in our businesses. We were encouraged as we enter 2014 and we are focused on executing our plans what remain poised to capitalize on changing market conditions and growth opportunities.","With that, I will turn the call over the Carl to review the segments. Carl?","","Carl Lukach","Thanks Nick. I would like to now provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides and complete segment commentary are posted on the Investors in our website under Events and Presentations along with other materials for today\u2019s call.","In Agriculture on Slide 11, we completed another successful year of industry leading performance with 13% annual growth in sales and 16% annual growth in operating earnings. We delivered a 60 basis point increase in operating margins despite the impact of higher seed input costs earlier in the year. Highlights included more than a 1 point of corn share gain in North America, a 3 point share gain in the 2013 Brazil safrinha corn season, the successful launch of approach picoxystrobin fungicide in the U.S. and Rynaxypyr insecticide exceeding $1 billion in annual sales.","Cyclically, our Agriculture segment has a seasonal loss in the fourth quarter, but this year operating earnings were positive for the first time at $88 million. Earnings improvement was driven by strong insecticide sales in Latin America led by Rynaxypyr, earlier seed shipments in the Brazil safrinha corn season and earlier direct seed shipments to North American farmers. As a result of the earlier timing of seed shipments about $100 million of operating earnings were realized in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter of 2014. As we move into 2014, the global Ag economy remains healthy. Farmer cash income and commodity prices are transitioning off of peak levels as global stocks are rebuilding from historically low levels. We feel good about our seed and crop protection order books in North America which are in-line with our expectations for this season. For the first half of 2014 we anticipate modest increases in both sales and operating earnings with growth rates negatively impacted by the previously mentioned timing change. We expect operating regions to partially recover following last year\u2019s one point first half decline as we benefit from lower seed input cost while continuing to make targeted investments globally for growth. For the full year we expect modest global growth in sales with earnings up moderately.","In electronics and communications on slide 12, operating earnings increased 50 million to 93 million driven by higher sales volume and improved plant utilization. Higher volume mainly from demand improvement and share gains in photovoltaic markets was offset in part by lower selling prices, largely from the pass through of substantially lower metals prices.","For the full year we expect sales to increase slightly as volume gains are tampered by declining metal prices with moderate growth and earnings. In Industrial Biosciences on slide 13 sales of 326 million were 9% higher on strong demand for Sorona polymer for carpeting and apparel and enzymes for ethanol production.","Looking ahead we expect full year operating earnings to be up substantially from healthy enzyme demand in our core markets. Animal nutrition, detergents and ethanol. On slide 14, Nutrition and Health operating earnings of 81 million increased 23 million driven by pricing gains and increased demand in specialty proteins, probiotics and cultures. Operating margin improved more than two points as pricing gains, mix enrichment and productivity actions more than offset growth investments.","For the full year we expect modestly higher sales and significant operating earnings growth. We expect full year operating margin to grow as we progress toward our long term margin goals.","Turning now to slide 15, as anticipated we did record a modest fourth quarter earnings decline in Performance Chemicals versus last year but we see science that the market is stabilizing. Fourth quarter TiO2 volumes increased 18% marking four consecutive quarters of year-over-year volume growth. Volumes were fueled by stronger demand in Europe and China. We view customer inventory levels as normal and producer inventory levels remain essentially unchanged from the third quarter.","Full year volumes for our TiO2 business grew up 14% versus the prior year. We expect earnings will be down significantly in the first quarter versus last year due to the lower year-over-year prices in TiO2 and floor [ph] products. However we expect full year 2014 earnings will be up modestly due to higher segment volumes. In Performance Materials on slide 16 we delivered another solid quarter by maintaining our focus on application development while leveraging our global reach. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $295 million increased 22 million or 8%, sales of 1.6 billion were up 3% with higher volumes partially offset by lower prices. Our polymer sales into the China automotive market for example were up 23% versus the prior year marking two consecutive quarters where growth exceeded 20%. 2013 was a strong year and we increased full year operating margins by a 100 basis points to 20%. In 2014 operating earnings are forecasted to be essentially flat as modest volume growth is offset by a lower capacity due to a scheduled eth ethylene outage and the impacts of portfolio changes principally the Glass Laminating Solutions\/Vinyl sale anticipated later in the year.","In Safety and Protection on slide 17 improved demand for Kevlar and Nomex fibers coupled with a benefits of our prior year restructuring and productivity gains, lifted quarterly earnings by 57%. Operating margins for this segment also improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. While segment sales were up 1%, a strong sales mix delivered the positive earnings growth despite continued weakness in the governmental spending session in all regions. It\u2019s for 2014 operating earnings will be up moderately reflecting improved demand with a richer sales mix alongside continuing productivity gains. That concludes our comments for these above segments.","Now, I will turn it back to Ellen.","","Ellen Kullman","Great, thank you Carl. As we move forward in 2014, we have positive momentum across our portfolio. While uncertainties exist, market demand is improving and we are executing successfully against our value creation plan. We expect a gradual, sequential improvement in the global economy that we saw at the end of last year to continue. From a regional perspective, we expect gradual improvement in the U.S. economy to continue. Demand projections from the automotive and housing industries are positive. This provides a good platform for growth in our Performance Materials, Safety & Protection, Industrial Bioscience and Performance Chemicals segment.","In Europe, our business has improved in each of the past two quarters. We expect sequential growth to continue as industrial production across Europe recovers from recession. In Central and Eastern Europe, our largest business is in Agriculture, where we see plenty of opportunity for continued growth in 2014. In addition, we expect our advanced materials businesses to benefit from the GDP growth that is projected in developing Europe.","In China, we are assuming GDP growth will remain in the 7% to 8% range and anticipate continued improvement in key areas like photovoltaics and automotive. We are closely monitoring infrastructure investments as they have a positive implication for depots [ph] in our Electronics & Communications, Performance Chemicals and Safety & Protection businesses. From an industry perspective, we expect healthy fundamentals in the automotive industry as global car builds are projected to increase about 4%. We will continue to leverage our innovation centers to partner with OEMs and apply our world-class application development expertise to meet their challenges in performance, light-weighting and energy efficiency.","In the global TiO2 market, we saw the industry stabilize in 2013 with stronger global demand driving lower inventory levels throughout the value chain. In 2014, we anticipate that industry fundamentals will continue to show improvement, but the timing and strength of recovery is evolving. In Agriculture, we expect another year of solid operating earnings growth against a backdrop of an Ag economy, which remains healthy, but where farmer income and commodity prices are transitioning off of their peak. Though growers remain somewhat uncertain about the total planted areas and which crop to plant, our attractive value proposition to maximize their profitability is clear. Our order book and seed and crop protection confirms that our customers continued to demand our newest high-performing innovative seed and crop protection technologies. Our strategies and priorities are clear. Goals are defined and in place and we are executing well.","We remain focused on advancing our operational priorities: innovation, global reach and strong execution. Paired with disciplined capital allocations, these priorities will enable us to continue our track record of delivering increased value for our shareholders while achieving our long-term growth targets. Our businesses will leverage their scientific capability to increase return on research and development while expanding our pipeline. We continue to strengthen our market penetration into developing markets and increased collaboration with the region\u2019s fast growing companies and will continue a relentless focus on cost and capital productivity across the company as we have successfully done over the past five years.","In summary, we are looking forward to 2014 into advancing each of our strategic and operational priorities. These priorities form the backbone of our value creation strategy and chart the best pathway to building a higher growth, higher value DuPont Company for our shareholders. Carl back to you.","","Carl Lukach","Okay thank you Ellen. Let\u2019s open up the line now for your questions. John?","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","And our first question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","Good question in Ag, Ag pricing was flat in 4Q but maybe there was some impact of the realty valuation. So can you talk about what kind of local seed pricing did you achieve in the safrinha season in Brazil and in North America.","","Ellen Kullman","The planning has begun in Brazil. It's a dynamic situation. We find people that are still very interested in what the seed can do with them. I mean safrinha corn acres are going to be down but they are interested in the new technologies, the new hybrids. We continue to see good demand for our high performing products. North America pricing our corn prices are flat to up slightly and expect modest price increases are based on a lot of mix improvement there. So it's still, the order books is about expected it's still is a very dynamic situation but we see it one playing out strongly in terms of the newer products and what we can do then to impact their yield in 2014.","","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","And my follow-up question is quickly the royalty payments to Monsanto that you will have in 2014 and \u201915. Can you just walk us through how does that impact you or income statement and cash flow? Thank you.","","Ellen Kullman","Well as you know royalty payments we record them as we sell units. So we have a small introductory launch in 2014, it's going to have a small impact. I think if I remember correctly it's going to be about 5% of our 2014 sales volume will be these products.","","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","I was wondering if Nick could clarify something on share repurchase. It looks like you\u2019re going to buy back about I don\u2019t know 32 million shares this year. How many shares are you going to issue? And when you did your 1.5% calculation I couldn\u2019t tell what came from an average share count difference and what came from newly issued shares?","","Nick Fanandakis","So your calculation is about right. I mean you have to look at the price when the shares are purchased but if you do it based on today\u2019s pricing you would say somewhere around 30 million shares would be coming back and then you also have to consider the time element of when those are going to occur as to how much they are going to impact the diluted share count but specifically around how many are going to be reissued in the way of dilution. If you look historically somewhere in the range of 8 million to 12 million shares, new shares issued historically on a per year basis.","","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay great and for my follow-up you got a turnaround in your Orange, Texas cracker. I guess that begins in May. So I would imagine that that doesn\u2019t affect your first quarter Performance Materials results. Is that correct? It would affect the second quarter Performance Materials results?","","Ellen Kullman","Yeah it will affect the second and third quarter because of the lack of volume that will be coming out in the second. We think it will be over a little bit to the third as well.","","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Yeah question on corporate cost, Nick you mentioned that you\u2019ve pretty much offset the 200 million stranded cost associated with coatings. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s the amount of stranded cost that you see with once you exit Performance Chemicals and is there a view to try and get ahead of that and maybe take more aggressive action on corporate infrastructure costs this year?","","Nick Fanandakis","So when you look we have talked about this a little bit before, Don, when you look at the people that were involved in the coatings divestiture, a significant number are very labor-intensive, less folks in the P-Chem side, so less of the overhead impact that would be applicable than you saw in the coatings side. The number is about half of overhang in that one versus what was on the P-Chem side, but then when you talk about the other opportunities, maybe Ellen you want to.","","Ellen Kullman","Yes. So as I take a look at it, although the people are left and that does have an impact. It is about 20% of our company from a revenue base. And so we are looking \u2013 we are taking the opportunity in 2014 to relook at our corporate core to relook at how we support the businesses from every function and how the businesses deploy regionally to understand is there a different opportunity for us to take some actions this year that would enable a more efficient, more effective structure going into the spin. So we are in the beginning of that process right now. We are benchmarking other companies looking deeply into our own how we structure that. And \u2013 I think that we will be talking about that more as the year goes on, because my goal would be to as we effect the spend to go into it with momentum in terms of the corporate core and not have that overhead be with us for the year as it has been in 2013.","","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","And you have a preliminary target for what additional costs you might be able to take out beyond the stranded costs?","","Ellen Kullman","No. We will share that with you when we get something that it can \u2013 it has some meaning behind it.","","Operator","And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Ellen, just on TiO2, are you expecting some price increases in the back half of the year?","","Ellen Kullman","Well, TiO2 is one of the hardest things to forget and as I call it the markets in the industry is evolving. We have seen it bottoming. We have seen volume progression as you have seen. I think it certainly depends on how strong the economy is and what kind of growth we see there next year. And I think it will play out much as the markets we see. We are saying first quarter earnings are going to be down and it\u2019s just the math of where the volume and prices, but that for the full year, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 our P-Chem segment is going to be up a little bit. So we do believe that the economy and what the markets are doing will predict exactly how that\u2019s going to play out.","","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And just on safety, strong Q4 results Ellen, can you talk about the mix impact in Q4 and the potential for margins in 2014 given the improved mix and perhaps swung up Cooper River as well?","","Ellen Kullman","Yes. So we delivered strong fourth quarter, obviously especially from operating earnings standpoint and that\u2019s driven off of demand for Kevlar and Nomex and even the service businesses closing out some of their year-end projects and things like that. We saw the benefits from the restructuring and the productivity in that segment that we put in. And we have seen improved plant utilization at Cooper River and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the four consecutive quarters of operating margin improvement. In 2014, we expect mix to be a positive, so a slight margin improvement from that as we continue to drive in that business. We are making progress. I think we are getting the job done and will continue to improve throughout 2014.","","Nick Fanandakis","And then let me just add in the progress we are talking about is not only from the utilization, but also from the productivity and the restructuring work this was done in realizing that value.","","Operator","And our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning. I have a question on TiO2 as intrigued by your comments that there has been improvement in Europe and China, but it would seem that maybe the end markets have been stronger in the U.S. So is there something peculiar about why you haven\u2019t seen better trends in the North American markets?","","Ellen Kullman","Yes, I think that North American season we are just heading into now. So I think \u2013 and North America because of construction didn\u2019t have as big an impact as we saw with the variability in China and with Europe being on it back. I mean, we saw growth in all regions. It was just notable in Europe and China.","","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","And on your lines turnaround, are you going to be able to add any incremental capacity to that low cost unit?","Ellen Kullman","I would love to but I don\u2019t think so we need to get this done so we can continue to operate it at the very high utilizations that we operate that unit.","","Operator","Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.","","John Roberts \u2013 UBS","Would you expect the Ag business to return to a loss in the next quarter or are those distribution changes in the U.S. and Latin America continuing so that you might see the same kind of affect at the end of this year.","","Ellen Kullman","You\u2019re asking the same question I was asking the team. I think what we see is with the progression of the crop protection products specifically insecticide, Rynaxypyr, which has a huge impact in the fourth quarter in Latin America. We see with localizing our production capability in Latin America and the seed business has enabled us to shorten those supply lines and people want their hybrids and their current [ph] sizes and things like that. So we think that it will be positive in the fourth quarter going forward. So we will see I mean a lot of it depends on how the seeds in Latin America plays out and the safrinha corn shipments those investments have enabled us to basically deliver on that in the fourth quarter.","","John Roberts \u2013 UBS","Is it too early to talk about emerging market industrial trends, stock market is obviously very concerned about that but you\u2019re little bit further up in the supply chain in many of your businesses that maybe you\u2019re just not seeing anything yet?","","Ellen Kullman","I mean we read the papers too so we\u2019re looking at that very, very strongly. We had a good 2013 in emerging markets. I mean if you look at it in total volumes were up 10% and sales were up six and that\u2019s based on TiO2 pricing and the metals passed through with a negative last year. But we finished the year strong in the fourth quarter with volumes up 11 and that was largely driven by China with photovoltaic and they were catching up for the year and that\u2019s not lost on it. They had a weak first half of \u201913 but photovoltaic was catching up TiO2 volumes through there. So we watch it very, very carefully because every quarter seems to be a new quarter in the emerging market and you got to be very agile and be able to move very quickly depending on the trends. So we are cautiously I think optimistically I mean two [ph] stronger world but we it's going to be sequentially continue to improve.","","Operator","Next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","","Unidentified Analyst","This is (indiscernible) filling in for John. So you saw some pretty good volume growth in electronics and communications but pricing seems to be getting weaker. What are you seeing in the PV markets and any idea what the inflection point is for pricing and electronics?","","Ellen Kullman","Pricing in electronics is surely silver [ph]. So if you think about the change in silver price over the last year it's been negative on a 10% - 12% and that will continue in the first quarter. So the pricing of our materials at silver is [ph] is very much of a function of the efficiency that it enabled in the solar modules and alike and we\u2019re getting really good response off of our new Solamet paste business and the Tedlar Films because of their longevity and their ability to create long warranties on these units. So the year-over-year kind of pricing is a function of silver and we\u2019re making impacts based on the functionality of the materials themselves and that\u2019s enabling share gains for us in that marketplace.","","Unidentified Analyst","Good and as a follow-up I think you had guided to about $300 million of pretax cost savings in 2013. So first were you able to achieve that and any kind of guidance for 2014 or how should we think about that for 2014?","","Nick Fanandakis","We had strong performance on our productivity targets. We were able to as I mentioned in the call we were able to get rid of all of the deeply (indiscernible) overhang that is gone and we\u2019re able to meet all of our other targets around fixed cost productivity. As far as next year goes, we are going to continue to drive productivity within the company. We will have some additional gain from the restructuring effort that occurred in \u201812 about another $150 million. And we are looking at above another $300 million of other productivity gains. So if you look towards \u201814 it\u2019s probably going to be around that $400 million to $450 million range.","","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, good morning. Your pension deficit narrowed about twice as much as expected. It sounds like that was mostly capital markets related, but my question is what implications if any does that have on capitalization of Performance Chemicals as you spin it off in terms of debt load or allocation of the pension?","","Nick Fanandakis","Yes. So let\u2019s talk just a little bit about what happened on the pension liability first, Kevin. So when you look at it driven by really three things, about half of the reduction in the liability came from the discount rate changing. And if you look at the global discount rates, they improved by about 69 basis points, so 69 basis points had little over $2.5 billion of impact on the liability. The other two components were the return on the assets, where we are much better than anticipated in the original estimates, almost double and the changes in the OPEB planned adjustments, those two together come for the other half or roughly above $5 billion of liability reduction. Now, how does this impact the P-Chem piece? I have talked about this before these are decisions that we are going to be making as we move forward with the separation. But when you look at the decision around what goes to P-Chem in the way of potential pension liability or debt, it\u2019s really either\/or, so you can choose to put no pension and owe it up on more debt or you can choose to put pension in debt or it\u2019s a balance. And so those decisions will be made further out in the process, but this really won\u2019t have an impact on that as we move forward.","","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","This is a follow-up if I may, I think last month Nick when you unveiled your macro outlook for 2014 you had the dollar strengthening about 2%, is that still the case today you or have you made any adjustments there given the volatility that we are seeing?","","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, it\u2019s going to be slightly up in 2014 the dollar strengthening is going to be slightly up. So we will have some additional headwinds in \u201814.","","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitch from Wells Fargo.","","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. A question on use of cash obviously you unveiled this the new share buyback program today and you indicated that you got $1.7 billion of debt maturing here in the first half I was wondering if you are going to pay that off or refi that? And then what is this \u2013 what\u2019s the current M&A market like out there and what are the possibilities that we could see Du Pont be active in doing something from a corporate perspective?","","Nick Fanandakis","Great. Frank, so you are right about the $1.7 billion of debt and that\u2019s just going to pay that off, we are not going to refi that. So we will use the cash we have on hand to do that as well as the 2 billion share repurchase. So \u2013 and as far as the M&A market, we continue to look \u2013 Ellen maybe you want a few thoughts.","","Ellen Kullman","Yes. No, I mean, we have been \u2013 we continue to look and see that there is opportunities smaller in nature more specific to geographies like Pannar or technology and we continue to pursue them. As you know, I have a pretty high bar in terms of what\u2019s required for us to affect that. And we continue to work in those markets. So we calculated that this buyback still has that opportunity for us to do some bolt-ons and some things like that, but we thought it was important given the big change from the pension and OPEB standpoint that we would be clear about how we are going to utilize our cash.","","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s very helpful. Sorry, that you are going to pay down that loan, Nick, because I was actually going offer you a teaser rate and a toaster if we got part of that business. Lastly, on the spin-off of Performance Chemicals what is your current thoughts on timing and does a possibility exist that there might be a sale involved of part or all of that asset?","","Ellen Kullman","Yeah so the timing is still as we discussed second quarter of \u201915. We\u2019re working on the carve outs. We have named the leaders as you\u2019ve seen. We continue that planning process, that\u2019s five quarters from now and so we will see what happens transpires between now and then but we have a good economic model of what this spin will bring and I think we\u2019re driving down that path.","","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Two quick ones, first on the Electronics & Communication segment considering the strength of the year-over-year performance expected in Q1. How are you expecting the cadence in the balance of the year and are there any headwinds that are becoming more severe over the course of the year and then on the Nutrition business can you give a quick survey of regional trends? Thank you.","","Ellen Kullman","Yes so electronics is always one that it's hard to predict. We have given you the input for the first quarter. For the whole year we are expecting the growth in installations on PV to be about the same as it has been about 15 and so we expect that to continue. We saw a lot of our volume this year in the second half of the year. So the first part of \u201914 looks like it's starting strong. We will see where that goes; we\u2019re taking that for a whole year. We\u2019re in good shape for moderate earnings growth even with the change and the silver pricing year-over-year. So that\u2019s one that we watch very carefully because there is a lot of noise out there relative to where it's trade issues or things like that but I will tell with the efficiencies and where the pricing is on the modules today it really is driving as option rate that should be able to accomplish the growth this year.","","Nick Fanandakis","And with the moderate earnings growth, because what Ellen said on the metals piece top-line is going to be online slightly up but without the metals piece it would be more in the modest range.","","Ellen Kullman","Yeah for Nutrition in the regions still there is no sting [ph] about, we\u2019re seeing broadly demand across all regions. Real interest in some products like probiotics and the differentiated in food ingredients and we\u2019re seeing it in Latin America we\u2019re seeing it in Asia, North America, Europe and so we\u2019re making great progress in that business and we spent the time over the last two years really building out the capability for that business in the emerging markets and we\u2019re seeing the results of that. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making.","","Operator","Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","Just want to go back to the seed pull forward real quick. I mean just quick calculation, to me that seems like it's over a 1.5 million bags of seed that got pull forward. One is that roughly which I would put say 10% of your seed sales in the America. Is that about the right sizing of it and then what\u2019s the split between Latin America and North America?","","Ellen Kullman","I think the numbers you\u2019re quoting are high from my standpoint. I think its 60:40 really, 60% Latin America, about 40% is U.S.","","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","Okay and then just one last one quick on the lead paint litigation in California that you guys got extricated from. Is that still your responsibility or is that the responsibility of your paint business that you spun off Axalta?","","Ellen Kullman","DuPont was the person that was named in the suit and nobody was responsible for it because we got excluded.","","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","But you\u2019re still handling the legal side of it so you\u2019re still defending yourself, that didn\u2019t get passed on to Axalta I guess is the way.","","Ellen Kullman","No that litigation was a DuPont litigation historically.","","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Within Ag I\u2019m wondering if there are any updated thoughts around the acreage estimates for latest seed products with the earlier seed delivery for corn you know looking at 10 million acres of AQUAmax and 2\/3rds from AcreMax and then with more favorable soybean economics whether the soya supply chain is geared for more substantial growth in the 1\/3rd that Paul was talking about 3 or 4 months ago.","","Ellen Kullman","I think on AQUAmax last year we did just over 7 million acres this year is going to be over 10. So I think we performed well. We are happy with what we saw out of that performance in \u201813. And I think that\u2019s going to continue to make progress. We see the new varieties, the new hybrids really continuing to penetrate as people understand what the value of that truly is. So we are making good progress there. And the order book is showing that as it confirms the grower demand for our newest technologies. And I think another fruit point there is the cash payments from North America season are up slightly and so they are I think that\u2019s the positive as well.","","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Sure. And then real briefly on TiO2 feedstock pricing, I don\u2019t know if there was any part of your prepared comments that talked about your outlook for feedstock supply and demand, not necessarily TiO2 itself, but just on the feedstock side?","","Ellen Kullman","Yes, I guess Nick?","","Nick Fanandakis","Yes. So when you look at market costs for ore they are down from the peak. It all depends on the contractual arrangements you have. So our ore costs maybe up slightly, but even with that ore costs being up slightly we are still very advantaged versus the market environment.","","Carl Lukach","Okay, John that concludes the time that we have for the call today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lori Koch. Please go ahead.","Lori Koch","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DowDuPont\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DowDuPont\u2019s website, and through the link to our webcast.","Joining me on the call today are Marc Doyle, Chief Executive Officer; Jean Desmond, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Breen, Executive Chair. Please read the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in this slide. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.","Our Form 10-K as modified by our first quarter Form 10-Q and current report include detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today excludes significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our press release and in the appendix of our slides. For your awareness, we have kept our prepared remarks to about 20 minutes in order to allow a full 30 minutes of Q&A and then end a little early, so that you can join the Corteva call, which starts at 9:00 a.m.","I will now turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Doyle","Thanks, Lori, and good morning everyone. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the incredible accomplishment achieved by the entire DuPont organization that enabled the successful separation of Dow on April 1 and Corteva on June 1. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for all they did over the past 3.5 years to execute our industry-defining transaction. I\u2019d also like to specifically acknowledge Jim Fahey for his role in the integration of the Dow and DuPont electronics businesses and his more than 25 years of service. As we announced this morning, Jon Kemp will succeed Jim as President of the E&I segment.","Let\u2019s get started on the quarter on Slide 2. We delivered a strong quarter and navigated dynamic market conditions in select end markets by staying dedicated to our core principles of innovation-led growth and disciplined cost control. We significantly expanded both gross and operating EBITDA margins and grew pro forma adjusted EPS in the high single digits versus the year ago period. We also continued to drive returns on our innovation spend with key new wins across several high-growth trends, including auto electrification, 5G, health care, water and sustainable food sources.","Looking closely at the numbers, total sales of $5.5 billion were down 3% on an organic basis as continued strength in Safety & Construction was more than offset by the well-documented weakness we and others are seeing in electronics and automotive end markets. Organic sales in our core segments were down by 1.7%. Regionally, organic sales were down 2% in the U.S. and Canada, down 3% in EMEA, down 4% in Asia Pacific and up 1% in Latin America.","The organic sales decline in the U.S. and Canada was primarily driven by lower sales in the non-core segment from weak polysilicon pricing, impacting demand. Weakened automotive and electronics end markets continued to drive the declines in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. However, we did see sequential improvement in our China results with sales down 3% versus prior year in the second quarter versus 10% in the first quarter. The increases were realized across all of our core segments.","One of the key bright spots in the quarter was the substantial improvement in gross margin, which was realized in all of our core segments. Gross margin improved more than 200 basis points as a result of our pricing discipline, plant productivity and cost control.","All in, swift action in light of prolonged market weakness led us to outperform from an operating EBITDA perspective versus expectations in spite of a weaker top line. Operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion was essentially flat with the prior year period, resulting in strong operating leverage and demonstrates our ability to deliver pricing and drive operating efficiencies amid challenging market conditions.","Excluding currency, operating EBITDA in our core segments was up 6% on a year-over-year basis. We also delivered operating EBITDA margin improvement of 170 basis points versus the prior year and have delivered operating EBITDA margin improvement of greater than 300 basis points since the second quarter of 2017.","Adjusted EPS, as shown on Slide 3, was up 9% on a pro forma basis versus prior year driven by lower depreciation and amortization. The quarter also benefited from a $0.03 per share tailwind from a lower share count, in line with the share repurchases we did as part of DowDuPont and a priority that we will maintain as part of new DuPont evident in the $250 million in purchases that we have completed to date.","Before I turn the call over to Jean to discuss the quarter in full detail, I\u2019ll provide an update to our full year guidance as well as our expectations for the third quarter on Slide 4. For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be slightly down versus the prior year. This change in expectation is a reflection of the prolonged weakness in our short- cycle businesses, primarily automotive and semiconductors, causing both lower volumes and pricing headwinds as a result of the supply\/demand imbalance.","From an earnings perspective, we expect operating EBITDA to be on the low end of our previously stated range. We are targeting $80 million in cost actions, in addition to the $30 million we took in the second quarter, to mitigate the macro headwind from both price and volume in the second half. These new cost actions are biased towards the fourth quarter and include the benefit of a restructuring program authorized during the second quarter of up to $130 million.","All in versus our previous guidance, we lowered our organic sales by approximately 300 basis points versus the previous midpoint and lowered EBITDA by about 90 basis points versus the prior midpoint, which is a direct reflection of our ability to mitigate weak market conditions with levers that we can control. We are raising our pro forma adjusted EPS guidance to $3.75 to $3.85 per share reflecting the strong second quarter results, the net impact of our second half segment earnings revision and updated D&A and tax rate assumptions, the latter of which is now expected to be at the high end of the range.","For the third quarter, we expect organic sales to be down low single digits. From an earnings perspective, we expect our tight management of spend and strong productivity actions will again enable us to deliver strong operating leverage despite a lower top line. For the third quarter we expect pro forma adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.99 per share.","In the appendix we provide segment-level commentary, as well as some additional model and guidance.","Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our team continues to navigate the market uncertainty by capitalizing fully on our competitive strengths and focusing on the levers within our control to deliver strong bottom-line results. These actions will position us well as markets recover to capitalize on our improved cost structure and investments in innovation.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jean.","Jean Desmond","Thanks Marc. On Slide 5 you can see a snapshot of the second quarter sales and operating EBITDA result for each of our segments.","Before I move into the segment detail, I want to assess our performance opposite two of our medium-term financial targets: organic revenue growth and operating leverage. We set a medium-term target for organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, which was based on a 3% global GDP. Regardless of your view of what global GDP will be for 2019, it\u2019s clear that our current year performance is well short of this medium-term target.","For the year, we expect our sales to be slightly down organically. While several of our most exciting end markets, such as Water Solutions and probiotics, saw high single and double-digit growth in the quarter, the softness in short-cycle businesses that Marc talked about are overpowering these bright spots. We are committed to meeting the targets we have set and are taking actions to move our performance in the right direction. ","Our R&D spend is biased towards high-growth, high-return areas that we believe will allow us to continue to accelerate our innovation-led growth. We are also taking actions in Non-Core, which is now a separate segment in our reported results. Once complete, these portfolio actions alone are expected to improve our underlying performance. For 2019, we expect the Non-Core segment to negatively impact our organic sales growth by about 80 basis points.","Let me also address operating leverage. We are committed to delivering 1.5 times operating EBITDA growth over our expected top line growth. Through the first half, we\u2019ve generated greater than 80 basis points of operating EBITDA growth in an environment where our top line has declined nearly 500 basis points. With continuing softness in the second half, we are taking additional cost actions, as Marc mentioned, to maintain our leverage.","With that, let me provide some additional details on the segment results. Starting with Electronics & Imaging on Slide 6. Second quarter sales of $858 million and operating EBITDA of $246 million reflect continued soft consumer demand, coupled with customer destocking, which was mostly driven by high inventory levels in the memory sector. Our position in Advanced Materials for the production of next-generation smartphones launching later this year remained strong. We are encouraged by the pace of early orders. ","Additionally, we continue to see strong volume gains in OLED display materials. However, greater-than-expected softness and high inventory levels resulted in a year-over-year volume decline in Semiconductor Technologies, one of our highest-margin businesses in E&I. These declines led to a less favorable product mix, lowering operating EBITDA margin by 280 basis point versus second quarter of 2018.","Looking forward, we expect growth in our Interconnect Solutions business as we see the launch of new phone models later this year but also anticipate continued soft market conditions in the semiconductor space. You can see the results of our Nutrition & Biosciences business on Slide 7, which delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year on cost synergies and pricing gains across all regions and businesses.","Nutrition & Biosciences delivered operating EBITDA of $391 million on sales of $1.6 billion. Bright spots within the N&B portfolio included probiotics, which returned to double-digit growth this quarter with particular strength in Asia-Pacific, and mid single-digit growth in microbial control. We also continued to see strong demand growth in our Food & Beverage business from a plant-based meat trend. Offsetting these areas of strength, we saw declines in functional solutions within Food & Beverage driven by the unseasonably cool start to the summer season in North America, impacting our dairy market sales.","Volumes in Pharma Solutions declined low single-digits due to capacity constraints and mix enrichment as we shift the portfolio towards higher-margin products. We expect to see a solid growth trajectory from Nutrition & Biosciences businesses supported by a return to positive growth from Food & Beverage and Pharma Solutions in the second half. We will continue to invest our R&D dollars into exciting spaces such as the microbiomes to drive innovation-led growth.","Slide 8 shows the results of our Transportation & Industrial segment. Similar to E&I, T&I is exposed to short-cycle businesses, mostly autos and electronics where weak demand continues driven by the global macroeconomic conditions and U.S.-China trade tariffs. This weaker demand also led to additional softness in Europe, where volumes for the segment were down mid-teens percent primarily driven by a weaker export market into China.","T&I sales of $1.3 billion were down 7% versus the year ago period on an organic basis with 12% volume decline, partially offset by 5% pricing strength. In the second half, we anticipate year-over-year pricing gain will diminish and sequential prices will decline modestly and supply\/demand balances normalize versus the prior year.","Operating EBITDA of $357 million declined 11% with lower volumes and a currency headwind more than offsetting price increases and cost synergy savings. For the third quarter, we expect a similar volume environment with ongoing weakness in auto and electronics as a result of lower demand out of China and continued destocking in the polymer distribution chain. Global auto inventory levels improved in the second quarter, and we anticipate polymer inventory levels to normalize by year-end.","We anticipate lower demand will be partially offset by additional productivity action. The results of our Safety & Construction business are shown on Slide 9. Net sales of $1.3 billion, up 5% on an organic basis, coupled with operating EBITDA margin improvement of 690 basis points led to operating EBITDA of $382 million, up 29% from the prior year. The 5% organic growth included a 4% pricing gain, which was across all businesses and all regions led by Safety and Water Solutions. The 1% volume growth included high single-digit growth in the Water Solutions business, which was led by gains in Asia Pacific. This growth in water was offset by lower volumes in Shelter Solutions on continued softness in the North America residential construction market.","Growth in operating EBITDA was led by Water and Safety businesses, where local price gains, cost synergies, productivity improvements and higher volumes in water more than offset a currency headwind. As we look to the second half for Safety & Construction, we anticipate the pace of price improvements to decline as we begin to lap many of our prior year price increases. We also have several planned maintenance shutdowns in the back half of the year, which will impact both our volumes and our earnings.","Let me wrap up with a few comments on the balance sheet and return on invested capital on Slide 10. You\u2019ll see that our capital structure is nearly final at this point with a few remaining items, including a $200 million funding into our Swiss pension, which is planned before year-end as part of the separation.","At the end of June, our net debt was $15.6 billion. From a working capital perspective, we did see a use of capital in the second quarter versus the year-end 2018 balance sheet. We typically see an intra-year increase, but our second quarter increase was greater than normal driven by higher inventory levels due to a weaker demand and higher accounts receivable primarily due to stand-up activities required as part of the separation.","We continue to see $1 billion of working capital productivity opportunity and expect to bring our working capital more in line by year-end. We will publish a cash flow statement as part of the 10-Q, which will be filed next week. However, it includes the results of Dow and Corteva up until their separation.","Earlier, I spoke about two of our midterm financial targets: organic revenue growth and operating leverage. Return on invested capital is the third financial metric we have put in place and have stated a target of 100 basis point improvement annually. And since the beginning of 2017, we have driven well above a 200 basis point improvement. This performance shows that we have taken actions necessary to make this a meaningful metric for DuPont, and ROIC is now an embedded mindset across the company, which will help drive sustainable earnings growth.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Breen","Thanks, Jean. I\u2019ll provide an update to our strategic priorities on Slide 11. We are committed to delivering best-in-class performance, and in the quarter, we continued to advance our performance towards these goals. Our focus on innovation continues to accelerate growth from our robust R&D portfolio, as evidenced by our eighth consecutive quarter of pricing growth. ","We have and we\u2019ll continue to invest in innovation even during the weakness we are experiencing in our short-cycle businesses. In fact, our R&D spend as a percentage of sales was held steady at 4% for the quarter, in line with our targets. I am pleased with our cost productivity, including delivering over $100 million in cost synergies in the quarter, leading to 170 basis points of margin expansion.","We also continue to execute our portfolio actions and are actively engaged in discussions to sell the businesses within our Non-Core segment. We expect to have made meaningful progress on these divestitures within the calendar year. From a broader perspective, our portfolio presents potential for significant value creation over the long term. I am pleased with the organization\u2019s focus on driving free cash flow and improving ROIC. We recently issued a performance grant to members of our leadership teams, which has ROIC improvement as a key metric in the payout. Integral to achieving this goal is effective capital allocation, and our commitment to this priority is evidenced by our completion year-to-date of $250 million of share repurchases under our $2 billion plan. I can assure you that the organization will stay focused on its top strategic priorities with the ultimate goal of creating shareholder value.","I\u2019ll now turn it to Lori to open the Q&A.","Lori Koch","Thank you, Ed. With that, let\u2019s move on to your questions. First, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Please, provide the Q&A instruction.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Angel Castillosa","This is Angel Castillo on for Vincent. Just a quick question around your back half expectations. So you guys had talked about the 3Q guidance but just looking at what that implies for 4Q. It looks like it\u2019s a pretty sharp improvement in E&I for the fourth quarter and then also some improving trend in T&I even though third \u2013 3Q guidance seems to be getting worse sequentially. So just curious as to what\u2019s actually embedded in the back half. How do you wish it is and just how \u2013 maybe how dependent it is on trade resolution.","Ed Breen","Thanks for the question. Now let me give you a little bit of an overview and then let me turn it over to Marc for a little bit more detail. The difference by way just high level between the first half year and the sequencing through the year is the first half and second half sales are virtually flat in our planning. They\u2019re up just very, very slightly. And don\u2019t forget the fourth quarter, we have an easier comp because our businesses dropped off last year. So we\u2019ll have more positive organic growth in the fourth quarter. Still negative in the third, but that\u2019s an easier comp. ","So they actually look at the sequence in what we\u2019re saying. We\u2019re counting on the same soft \u2013 short-cycle markets staying down the rest of the year, which is basically the E&I plate businesses, the T&I stuff and, in E&I, the semiconductor businesses. So we\u2019re not counting on any improvement happening from that standpoint, so we\u2019re planning our cost structure and our business actions around that. ","But Marc, why don\u2019t you give a little more detail on that?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks, Ed. And yes, just to build on what Ed said, there is a couple of sequential changes, I mean, there\u2019s a slight improvement in E&I that\u2019s really driven by the premium smartphone market, as we said, last quarter. As launches happen in the second half, we\u2019ll see some additional sales. We\u2019re pretty confident with that. The orders started to pick up in the second quarter, and some of that is leading to a slight improvement in the back half for E&I. And then you asked about the trade resolution. We\u2019re not assuming that there\u2019s any change in the trade environment. So for our second half outlook, we\u2019re sort of staying the course here on the current situation. ","Angel Castillo","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just the other question I had is with \u2013 on cost cutting. So you guys talked about the $18 million here in the second half. How sustainable are these costs? Or if things improve, are these costs going to come back? Or how should we think about that?","Ed Breen","Yes. Probably a couple of comments on that. I think we\u2019re looking at that these costs as more permanently out of the system. So we did $30 million in the second quarter, and Marc and the team are doing another $80 million in the second half, as I think Jean said, biased more \u2013 Marc said biased more towards the fourth quarter by the time they kick in. I\u2019d also like to highlight for you a comment that Jean did make. We are not touching R&D if we\u2019re \u2013 just because we\u2019re seeing a little short-term softness. We\u2019re going to run the R&D around 4%, maybe just slightly above 4%, which is exactly aligned with all the detailed plans of the \u2013 that the team has. And I think that\u2019s really important. We\u2019re not going to clip our future growth prospects just because of a little weakness on short-term. ","Angel Castillo","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Ed Breen","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Good morning. Two questions from me. I want to pick up on the margins and then also thinking about cash flow. So the gross margin performance was very solid, impressive. Just picking up on the prior point a little bit, Ed or Marc. Just thinking about synergies versus kind of ongoing cost actions, how that mix might change or synergies kind of starting to run their course, tail off. And we might \u2013 and might we see kind of more kind of restructuring actions at this \u2013 well, going forward even in the face of perhaps better macro trends, say, into 2020?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Jeff, this is Marc. I\u2019ll take that. I mean yes, what we\u2019ll be seeing is \u2013 I mean, take 2Q as an example. We still delivered about $100 million in synergies. That will be happening through the end of the year here. But we also delivered productivity on top of that, as Ed said, about $30 million. We\u2019ll see more productivity and less synergy going into 2020. And we\u2019ve already teed up a number of areas that we intend to focus on, and so you\u2019ll see us talking more about that on a going-forward basis. The synergy program will end early next year. We\u2019ll deliver the last portion of that.","Ed Breen","One of the big areas that the team has focused on, to Marc\u2019s point about going in the future, is we have, as you know, a factory efficiency program going on, productivity there, which is pretty big for DuPont with some of the large facilities we have. And a big part of that M&A is in our S&C business, which has our bigger, tougher facilities. And as you can see, during this past year, the team has made really good progress in that business, and we were up almost 700 basis points in that business over the last year. And again, great progress in the quarter there. A lot of that is \u2013 we are getting pricing in that business, but we are seeing some volume growth. But really underlying that is really tremendous progress on that productivity on the factory footprint. So that\u2019s a big thing. And by the way, it\u2019s just not that. This happens to be the biggest opportunity. Marc\u2019s got a program with the team across all the businesses when it comes to that factory efficiency.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Byrne","Hi, I wanted to ask you about where you\u2019re seeing revenue synergies within your businesses. And is there potential for any more tailwind from this as we move forward?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Yes, Steve, let me take that. It\u2019s Marc. Yes, what we\u2019ve said from last year is that there are opportunities across the portfolio. The revenue synergies take a little bit longer to build due to qualification timing. There are some launches that have been happening this year. For example, some of the plant-based meat offerings, cellulosics, things like that are coming out of the new cellulosics portfolio. That was the combination of Dow and FMC. We did a beta launch of a smart materials offering around smart conference tables. That was also a Dow plus DuPont integrated offering. And so you\u2019ll see more and more of those launches. We\u2019ve sized the opportunity for revenue synergies at around about $400 million EBITDA, but we said it would be three to five years out. So the way I think of it is it\u2019s a growth kicker but at just a portion of the three to five-year growth objective. And it\u2019s really localized to those overlaps that exist in each of the segments actually if you look at the way we\u2019ve put Dow and DuPont together.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Bhavesh Lodaya","This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. As you think about the strategic opportunities to create value in the portfolio, do you think the macro weakness may facilitate even more options? Or does it potentially give you optionality if you choose to preserve your balance sheet?","Marc Doyle","I think \u2013 this is Marc. I\u2019ll kick it off and then I\u2019m sure Ed will add something. I think current macro is probably not the biggest driver for the opportunity here. I think if you look at the strength of each of these businesses in the portfolio and the opportunities to potentially look for either M&A or other transactions down the road, that we see plenty of opportunities across the board. Will the current macro drive more of that activity in the future? Hard to say.","Ed Breen","Yes. I\u2019m more \u2013 I don\u2019t think the macro \u2013 or if it\u2019s soft or not, I don\u2019t think it has any bearing on the strategic moves we would make whatsoever. If you make the right strategic moves, you\u2019re going to create value, so I don\u2019t take into account. I would say, as Jean mentioned, though, just to highlight on your portfolio comment, feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on the Non-Core front, and that will be cash coming into the company that we can deploy in a very smart way. And every metric practically improves as we exit the Non-Core businesses, whether it\u2019s revenue growth rate, margins, ROIC. So we\u2019ll really focused the team on really getting those transaction moving along quickly.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Let me just build on Ed\u2019s comment. That\u2019s a good point on Non-Core. We do get questions about whether market conditions and potentially softening would impact the value that we get for some of those divestitures, and I can tell you we\u2019re obviously well into things here. We\u2019re not seeing any issues there so far. The assets that we\u2019re putting up for sale are good products lines, businesses. They have strong interest in everything that we\u2019re rolling with here. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the cash generation potential.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys. I have a pretty high-level question, if you don\u2019t mind. With the trade war, there seems to be some, I don\u2019t know, idiosyncratic effect. Like maybe smarter people than me foresaw that the trade war lingering would cause automotive demand to drop, but I certainly didn\u2019t see that happening. And so as the trade war keeps going, are there other what I\u2019ll call idiosyncratic effects that you\u2019re seeing already or that you\u2019re worrying about? Or conversely, are there effects that could actually be positive for you?","Marc Doyle","Yes, good question, Jonas. I think it was hard to predict. And I wouldn\u2019t say automotive demand weakening was all about the trade war, but clearly that\u2019s a factor. There are multiple factors, I think, if you read some of the industry reports. The other industry that clearly there are some interesting dynamics is around the electronics industry, a lot of the headlines you read about the Chinese semiconductor industry and Chinese OEMs and U.S. suppliers. And I think we\u2019re relatively well positioned. We have a lot of our production local. We\u2019ve been positioned in Asia for quite some time, both in our automotive and our electronics product lines. But we have to continue to watch those dynamics in U.S.-China relationship and how those might affect the competitiveness of U.S. companies on the ground there.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thank you. So the N&B segment now can just be a bright spot with a few exceptions like bioactives, which was well expected. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes that you saw for the quarter, including the capacity constraint issue in Pharma Solutions? And then also, just if you can walk us through your long-term thoughts on the potential mix benefits from growing probiotics, pharma and cultures at a faster clip than the rest of the portfolio. Just any your comments on how that could affect your margin outlook for 2020 and 2021 would be appreciated. Thank you.","Ed Breen","Yes. I\u2019ll take your second part and Marc can also add on the first part. You\u2019ve been watching for a good three years now margin expansion every single quarter in the \u2013 with what was N&H and now it\u2019s N&B but generally those sets of businesses. We\u2019ve had margin expansion every single quarter except one. So there\u2019s like 15 quarters in a row, one we had a little bit of a blip. So a pretty good track record. And when you really dig into the detail \u2013 by the way, obviously, we\u2019ve had organic growth that\u2019s helped us. Our team has been very cost conscious on the G&A side, so they\u2019ve done a great job on that. There was a fair amount of synergies in that business because of the Dow stuff and FMC coming in, so they\u2019re doing a great job on that. But if you actually do the waterfall chart the biggest impact is actually your comment you\u2019re making or your question. It\u2019s been an enrichment story, and that should play out still next couple years. So I mean, by the way, I think if you do a compare of our businesses to the core competitors, our margins are fairly best in class unless you take and isolate your probiotic player or something like that. But we still think we have room to drive them up more towards the company average and be consistently up there. So \u2013 but the biggest part we\u2019ll get as we go forward is that mix piece, as what you said. It\u2019s pharma, it\u2019s probiotics and a couple of those pieces. But Marc, why don\u2019t you get into the puts and takes and what can happen in the second half?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Let me give you a little bit more on the first question. So the positive, the bright spots for N&B in the quarter clearly, as Ed mentioned, probiotics, back to double-digit growth. We announced also some pretty significant investments, both in capacity and new product launches, during the quarter, some additional R&D partnerships with other companies. So we\u2019re clearly doubling down to continue that long-term growth trajectory. And as Ed mentioned, that\u2019s a great mix enricher for margins in the long run. I\u2019d mention also the microbial business was back up mid-single digits in the quarter. That was good to see. And obviously, the plant-based meat trend is a fantastic one, and I think we\u2019re pretty well positioned in that market. We\u2019re working hard to be the R&D partner of choice for the companies in that space. It\u2019s a small business today. It\u2019s also a mix enricher. The margins in that space are higher than the average margins in the segment. So that\u2019s going to be a good long-term growth driver.","On the other side of the coin, I\u2019d say clearly the industrial enzymes business continues to have some market struggles. Bioethanol continues to be a really tough market. And so that\u2019s one that we\u2019re looking to, to hopefully get through during the course of the year and maybe see a recovery in 2020. Near term, we had some weakness in the quarter in pharma, which was really driven by capacity issues primarily. And so we do expect in the second half we\u2019ll see the pharma business back to the usual least low single-digit growth. The market demand there is strong. It\u2019s a good long-term market. We also had a little bit of weakness in the system solutions business because of weather in the quarter, and we think that will pass. We think Food & Beverage will be back up to low single digit in the second half. And so that\u2019s kind of a rundown product-by-product.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Good morning. Marc, just on Safety & Construction, a very strong first half, really good results. But you did call out maybe a weaker back half and you\u2019re constrained in capacity in Tyvek and aramids. So given \u2013 I know you\u2019re on capacity going forward. But given those dynamics, how should we think about safety in 2020? Maybe a little bit slower growth and slashed margins? Or can you drive price to drive higher results? Thank you.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks, David. It\u2019s a great question. FMC is obviously firing on all cylinders. As we said, the margin expansion, which the team has been working on for several years, is coming through. We\u2019re seeing great demand in the water business, great demand in the safety business. The only weakness is residential construction in the U.S., and we do expect at some point that\u2019s going to come back. And so we\u2019re really bullish here. The second half, a bit of a sequential softening. The primary factor there, I\u2019d say, is that we\u2019ve got some PMMAs, which are the big plant turnarounds. The Safety & Construction business has some sizable sites, and so when those come up for the once shutdowns, that lead to a slug of cost. I\u2019d say we\u2019re also being a little bit cautious in the outlook. Demand has been booming. Pricing is strong right now. We just don\u2019t want to assume that that\u2019s going to continue forever. But as we look to 2020, I think we\u2019re real positive on the continued growth in that business. The market drivers there, which are clean water, which are worker safety, good exposure to markets like aerospace and defense, I mean, those are all real strong spaces globally right now. So the exposure there on the market side is definitely a positive.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Dylan Campbell","Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Last quarter, you guys kind of broke out your key planning assumptions assuming global automobiles were up 4% in the second half, smartphone deliveries were up 2% in the second half. With the new guidance today, I mean, do you guys see any changes to those assumptions? And kind of what do you have embedded in your guidance?","Ed Breen","Yes. Just \u2013 by the way, just hit that, Marc; or Jean, jump in also. So the areas we talked about before, the three soft areas I just \u2013 there\u2019s \u2013 obviously, residential construction is down. But putting those piece aside, it\u2019s really the semi business is a little soft. The auto business is soft. And E&I business was soft, because of smartphones. So the planning is that autos are still down globally 5%, and we\u2019re saying no improvement in the second half of the year. By the way, it really looks like inventories in autos around the world, including China, are pretty much getting back to about normal levels. So that\u2019s finished goods inventory. But we still think the supply chain, as Jean mentioned, does still have some months to go to make sure that gets cleaned up. And then on the smartphone side, as Marc had commented on, we actually saw the improvement or see an improvement in the orders, we think, but it\u2019s not because global demand is up in smartphones. It\u2019s actually down. ","It\u2019s that we\u2019re driving extra content. And we are seeing those orders \u2013 we did see those orders begin in the second quarter mostly for the content we put in on the 5G side. So that\u2019s kind of the planning assumption on those two big areas. And we\u2019re expecting no improvement in the soft conditions on the semi inside kind of for the rest of the year. Therefore, by \u2013 back to my comment a few questions ago, we\u2019re planning kind of revenue flat, first half and second half, in the company. I think that\u2019s a good planning assumption. So we don\u2019t overspend. We watch our cost controls and all that.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Let me just build on Ed\u2019s comment. Ed mentioned auto, smartphones. Semiconductor, we have revised the full year planning assumptions. So we were saying early this year that it would be sort of low single-digit MSI growth. We\u2019re now expecting that that\u2019s going to be down a bit. And that\u2019s just consistent with what we\u2019re seeing in the market, particularly in memory. Memory prices are way down. Volumes are down. ","The Korean semiconductor market has been really soft here in the second quarter, and that\u2019s impacting our materials sales. Even as we\u2019re investing in next-gen qualifications aggressively in semi for advanced node products, the total volume is just down by a few percent, which is different than we expected starting the year. And so those are really the primary areas that we\u2019ve revised our full year expectations.","Operator","And our next question will come from will come from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.","Josh Spector","Hey guys. Just a clarification around free cash flow when you guys gave prior guidance, you were talking about pension costs around $200 million in cash, restructuring around $1,300 million, I guess Slide 10 has a couple buckets kind of similar size, adding $500 million. Is that incremental to what you were thinking before? So more cash use? Or is that the same numbers that you were expecting? ","Jean Desmond","Yes. No, those are actually the same numbers we were expecting. That\u2019s just pointing to the outflow in the second half of the year. So I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve had any substantial change to our view of free cash flow for the year, which, as we\u2019ve noted before, is primarily a lot of our free cash flow for 2019 is \u2013 was setting up the capital structures for the three new companies. So just providing color on the second half. ","Operator","And our next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the pricing momentum, I guess. Do you expect those gains to kind of continue? You mentioned lapping prior year price increases. How should we think about pricing going forward? And maybe if you can just describe that by segment. Thanks","Marc Doyle","Why don\u2019t I take that? This is Marc. So it\u2019s different segment to segment, clearly. We are assuming that we\u2019re starting to lap some of the significant price actions in the T&I segment. And we\u2019re assuming also in the S&C business we\u2019ll start to see a little bit less price in the back half. And so as it nets out, we\u2019ve been running about plus two per quarter, the first half of the year, on price. We think in the second half on a year-over-year basis we\u2019ll get down closer to being flat by the end of the year.","Now these are planning assumptions clearly it depends very much on the demand environment, and it depends on supply situation. So these things can change relatively quickly. One of the drivers for pricing for us in T&I has been not just the strong demand but also our very stable, predictable supply situation, particularly in the nylon product lines. And so we\u2019ve been one of the producers that customers can really count on to continue to deliver. So we\u2019ll take advantage of that strong supply capability if there\u2019s any further disruptions in supply in the industry and continue to try to drive pricing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning, folks. I was intrigued by the comment regarding China in terms of the declines getting \u2013 the year-over-year declines getting better Q2 versus 1Q, so just curious as to what you\u2019re seeing now that the month of July is behind us and what your expectations are in that part of the world. Then also, speaking about the quarter, you called out a customer settlement in Non-Core. What was the order of magnitude to that? Is that included in $0.94 to $0.99 guidance?","Marc Doyle","Yes, Frank. Let me take the first question then I\u2019ll hand the second question over to Jean. It\u2019s \u2013 I was laughing a little bit because it\u2019s rare that we would be bragging about minus 3% growth in China. I can\u2019t remember that happening in a long, long time. But it was a sequential improvement, and it is a little bit of a sign of life. The strength there has been across several of our segments. Most notably, I\u2019d say that E&I was up. Also, S&C continues to be very strong in China. The E&I growth is a statement around the China semi market, which is a bright spot for semi. Also, those orders starting for premium phones and the displays market growth is largely happening in China. On the S&C side, the water business just continues to be booming there, and the team is doing a great job of capturing growth there. That water growth is both in industrial \u2013sort of water cleanup for industrial operations as well as residential water market in China is really booming. And we\u2019ve put out a couple of new products in the quarter and have some notable share gains that are continuing that double-digit growth for us. So that\u2019s kind of the positive side of the China story right now.","Jean Desmond","And in terms of your question around non-core and the guidance for the third quarter, we do have an equity affiliate in non-core that has a history of settlements. They\u2019re always hard to call when those settlements are going to hit. But you are right; we are thinking that there could be one. There would be one in the third quarter as part of our guidance.","Operator","And our final question will come from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning. Just want to go back to S&C, if we could. Your guidance in May was kind of up low teens. You ended up high-20s on EBITDA. And at that time, you were thinking you were going to get decent pricing. So I\u2019m just trying to understand what changed from May to the final number that it ended up so much better.","Marc Doyle","Yes, good question, Duffy. I mean, the bottom-line is the two biggest segments there, water and safety, both over-delivered in terms of cost actions, productivity actions and pricing came in a little stronger than expected. So I would say the demand environment was notably different. We knew it will be a strong environment. But the team really executed well around controlling what we could control, driving productivity and then continuing to deliver on the pricing side of the equation. And so it\u2019s a good story for the quarter, good execution. Again, second half, we\u2019re being a little cautious on some of the things that are a little bit less in our control like the demand and pricing side. But I\u2019m expecting that we\u2019re going to keep delivering in S&C, and it\u2019ll be a good driver during the second half too.","Lori Koch","Thank you, everyone, for joining our call.

My name is John and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of DuPont's first quarter 2017 performance. Here with me are Ed Breen, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Collins, Executive Vice President responsible for our Agriculture segment.","The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release. During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements. I direct you to slides 1 and 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides, which are posted on our website.","Our agenda today will start with Ed providing his perspective on the company's performance, then Nick will review our first quarter financial results and first half 2017 guidance. Third, Jim will discuss our Agriculture business. We will then take your questions.","With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thanks, Greg, and good morning everyone. We delivered a very strong first quarter. We drove top and bottom line growth, improved free cash flow and advanced several key initiatives. While we have more work to do, we are very pleased with the progress we made on each of these fronts in the first quarter.","A few of the quarter's highlights were: organic sales grew 5%, gross margin expanded more than 80 basis points, segment operating margins increased about 250 basis points, operating earnings per share rose 30%, and free cash flow improved by over $200 million. We are encouraged by our top line results, which benefited from strong demand for our new product innovations as well as better-than-expected conditions in key end markets such as automotive and electronics.","Volumes rose 4% led by Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications. Volumes in Performance Materials rose 11%, which reflected strong demand for polymers in automotive markets, coupled with specialty copolymers growth in packaging and timing benefits at the detriment of the second quarter. Electronics & Communications grew volumes 15%. Growth in the consumer electronics and semiconductor markets as well as continued strength in photovoltaics drove the improvement in the quarter.","We also were encouraged by the 1% increase in local price, which was driven by the continued penetration of our Leptra corn hybrids in Brazil where we generated double-digit pricing gains.","In Industrial Biosciences, organic growth of 6% represented strength in both biomaterials and bioactives. Biomaterials volumes grew more than 30%, primarily reflecting demand for Sorona in our power markets.","Our 30% growth in operating earnings reflected this top line growth as well as gross margin expansion, benefits from exchange gains and losses, and lower income taxes. Nick will cover these items as well as the macro environment and its impact on our first half guidance.","Looking at the underlying results, I am incredibly impressed with how our people remained focused on delivering for our customers. This quarter's gains are a testament to those efforts and to the overall quality of our organization.","In terms of the merger, this past quarter, we achieved several significant milestones. Most importantly, as we announced last month, we secured conditional approval from the European Commission based on our commitment to divest certain crop protection products and R&D assets.","We also entered into an agreement with FMC to divest our crop protection remedy and to acquire substantially all of FMC's health and nutrition business. The products we're acquiring are high margin and highly complementary to our own Nutrition & Health portfolio.","We view these developments as major steps forward in closing the merger with Dow and maintaining the strength of our combined Agriculture business, while also significantly expanding our capabilities in the important and fast-growing Nutrition & Health industry.","We expect to close the merger in August of this year with the FMC transaction closing in the fourth quarter. Wherever possible, we have begun taking action on delivering the targeted $3 billion in cost synergies such as the announcement of our Cooper River Plant shutdown. Upon merger, we will quickly begin executing on the remainder of the 500-plus projects we identified to deliver the synergies.","With that, let me now turn it over to Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thank you, Ed. Beginning with slide 3, First quarter operating earnings per share of $1.64 represents an increase of 30% versus the prior year. Our results for the quarter reflect strong top and bottom line performance in the segments, along with benefits from favorable exchange gains and a lower tax rate versus the prior year.","Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.7 billion increased 5% versus prior year, driven by a 4% increase in volume and a 1% benefit from local price. Nearly all of our segments had sales growth in the quarter with Agriculture, Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications leading the way.","As you can see on slide 4, from a regional perspective, we saw growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, while sales in North America were even with the prior year. Our developing markets improved significantly with 15% growth year-over-year and they represent 31% of the total company sales.","Increased demand for polymers in automotive and growth in consumer electronics and semiconductors drove the improvement in Asia Pacific, while warmer weather conditions drove earlier-than-normal demand for seeds in Europe.","Turning to slide 5, segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in first quarter operating earnings, contributing $0.24 to the quarter. Top line organic growth in most of our segments and continued execution on cost savings improved segment operating earnings. Exchange gains and losses contributed $0.07 per share to the quarter's results. The benefit is primarily due to the absence of the prior-year currency devaluations in both the Ukraine and Argentina.","A lower tax rate added $0.04 to the operating EPS in the quarter, primarily reflecting a benefit associated with the adoption of a recent accounting pronouncement. In January 2017, the company adopted this new guidance regarding the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Lower net corporate and interest expense added $0.02 to earnings per share in the quarter and lower average shares outstanding contributed $0.01 to the quarter.","Now, let's turn to the first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide 6. Segment operating earnings increased $274 million or 16% in the quarter versus last year, with operating margin expansion of 250 basis points. Half of the improvement in segment results was driven by Agriculture, which Jim will speak to shortly.","Performance Materials operating earnings increased $82 million. Volume growth for the segment continued in the quarter with an 11% increase, driven by demand in global automotive and specialty copolymers in packaging products, as well as timing benefits from the second quarter.","Volume growth was slightly constrained by ethylene sales as we prepare for the turnaround of the cracker in the second quarter. Operating margins in this segment expanded by about 410 basis points year-over-year.","Electronics & Communications operating earnings increased $30 million. Volume grew 15% in the quarter, driven by demand in consumer electronics and semiconductor markets, showing solid improvement following a weak 2016 as well as stronger photovoltaic material sales. Operating margins improved by 440 basis points in the quarter.","Nutrition & Health results increased $17 million. Growth in probiotics and emulsifiers was offset by declines in protein solutions and systems and texturants resulting in volumes flat versus prior year. The business continues to focus its portfolio on higher growth, higher margin products such as probiotics and cultures.","In protein solutions, volume declines resulted from business-specific actions to exit certain low-margin markets, coupled with inventory destocking in the U.S. Plant productivity, mix enrichment and cost savings drove the improvement in operating earnings. Operating margins in this segment improved 235 basis points.","Industrial Biosciences operating earnings increased $12 million. Top line growth of 6% reflected volume and local pricing gains in biomaterials and bioactives. Operating margins expanded by 250 basis points in the quarter. I refer you to the materials we posted on our website today for further details on segment results.","Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and cash on slide 7. Negative cash flow of about $2 billion reflected agriculture's typical seasonal cash flow outflow in the quarter. Our free cash flow improved by more than $200 million year-over-year, with most of the increase coming from cash flow from operations. Lower capital expenditures contributed about $25 million of the improvement.","The improvement in cash flow from operations is primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments. The first quarter of 2016 included a prepayment to Chemours for delivery of certain goods and services.","In relation to working capital, the businesses continued to drive towards best-in-class. Working capital levels at the end of the quarter improved in comparison to the same period of the prior year, primarily from inventory and accounts payable.","Net debt increased in the quarter over our ending 2016 balance, which reflects our normal seasonal shifts. Primary uses of cash in the quarter related to the funding of our seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, growth investments and dividends. When compared to the same period in the prior year, net debt improved by $500 million.","On slide 8, I wanted to highlight the continued improvement we saw in operating costs year-over-year. Building upon our productivity improvements as a percentage of sales, operating costs declined about 130 basis points year-over-year on an operating earnings basis. SG&A costs declined about 80 basis points, with most of the decline related to G&A costs.","Turning now to slide 9. I'd like to provide our guidance for sales and operating earnings for the first half of 2017. This is more a representative view of the company's performance given the significance of agriculture and the length of the planting season in the Northern Hemisphere. We expect sales to increase low-single-digits percent versus prior year, and operating earnings to increase about 16% to about $2.90 per share versus prior year.","The increase in sales is driven by the change in timing of seed deliveries from the fourth quarter 2016, which primarily benefited the first quarter and strengthened our global automotive, consumer electronics, semiconductor and photovoltaic markets. Sales growth is expected to drive the increase in operating earnings.","Incremental earnings are net of the expected reduction in plant corn acres in North America and higher product costs in Performance Materials and Agriculture. Currency is not expected to impact the first half guidance.","We continue to expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, an increase from 2016 due to the anticipated geographic mix of earnings. For the half, the expected tax rate will be at the higher end of this range due to geographic mix.","In addition, as we stated in January, capital expenditures for the full year are expected to be in line with annual depreciation and amortization.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thank you, Nick. Within Ag, our priorities this year continue to be centered on building a strong, innovative business that is a leader in the industry both now and in the future. Those priorities are, first, achieve our sales, operating earnings and cash commitments. Second, drive rapid and successful technology launches. And third, prepare to close the merger and execute on integration plans in preparation for the intended separation.","Now, in accordance with our conditional approval from the European Commission, we are also preparing for the successful divestiture of certain assets of our crop protection business to FMC after the closing of the merger with Dow.","Our first quarter results show that we are delivering on our first priority and we are off to a solid start in the first half of the year, which is driven by the Northern Hemisphere and the Brazilian safrinha planting seasons. In the quarter, sales grew 4% while operating earnings increased by 12%. Our price and volume both improved by 2%, and the increases led to about a 240-basis-point improvement in operating margins.","Our price growth was led by double-digit increases in Brazil, driven by the continued penetration of our Leptra corn hybrids, which now account for almost 40% of our Brazilian safrinha volumes. Increased European sunflower seed sales also added growth to the top line from both price and volume, and we realized additional pricing gains from the continued launch of our Pioneer brand soybeans with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology.","Our seed volume also increased due to the shift in timing of seed deliveries, which benefited the first quarter by approximately $140 million. However, this growth was partially offset by the expected shift from corn to soybeans in North America.","Now, our crop protection business continues to outperform the industry, led by strong performance in Asia and Europe. Growth was driven by insecticides, including the return of Vydate volumes. We are still experiencing higher-than-normal inventory levels in Latin America specifically Brazil, but continue to believe the global industry is stabilizing.","As shown on slide 11, we are excited about our new seed and crop protection product pipeline, which is anticipated to deliver approximately $20 billion of aggregate peak sales for our future combined Ag business. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, last year's advancements from this pipeline are performing very well.","This planting season, we launched more than 50 varieties of our A-Series soybeans, including 30 varieties with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology. We are executing on our plans to drive new product volumes and we forecast the A-Series soybeans to comprise over 40% of our North American soybean volume by 2018.","Additionally, we continued to upgrade our corn hybrids and we now expect almost 70% of our North American corn volume this year to be from hybrids released in the past three years, enabling a favorable mix.","Within our crop protection business, we have recently received regulatory approval for three key products, including FeXapan; our over-the-top dicamba application on Roundup Ready 2 Xtend products; Vessarya, an important new fungicide for Asian soybean rust in Brazil; and the expansion of our Zorvec fungicide into additional global markets.","We also continue to expand our seed treatment portfolio with the launch of Lumisena, a fungicide used on soybeans and sunflowers in the U.S. All of these products will continue to support growth in crop protection post merger with Dow.","We also continued to expand Encirca, our digital Ag offering and expect to more than double the paid acres again in 2017.","Now, looking forward to the first half, we expect sales to increase by mid-single-digits percent. Top line growth will be driven by pricing gains realized by our new product introductions and volume growth across our soybean, sunflower and insecticide portfolios. Seed volumes will benefit from the timing of seed deliveries, but will be partially offset by expected declines in corn acreage in North America.","In the first half, we forecast operating earnings to grow by high-single-digits percent, driven by increased volume and favorable pricing. We expect operating margins to expand in the first half driven by price and volume gains, but the growth will be partially offset by higher soybean product costs related to higher commodity prices during production and increased royalties.","Finally, in the quarter, we advanced our merger and integration plans. I have been spending time with both organizations to really understand the cultures and together, we are defining our new culture that will build upon and blend our strong heritages. This is important work and will lay the foundation for our future Ag company. I look forward to updating you on the progress we have made against this and all of our 2017 priorities next quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thanks, Jim. Well, we'll now open the line for questions. John, if you could please provide the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In order to include as many of your questions as possible, management requests that you limit yourself to only one question. If you have additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. And our first question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I noticed in your Ag results, your depreciation and amortization costs went from $145 million to $78 million year-over-year or a $76 million movement downward, and also your pension costs came down from $146 million to $109 million. And on your non-operating pension, they went up maybe $20 million, so maybe your operating pension went down something like $57 million or $58 million. Can you explain those changes?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. Jeff, this is Nick. I think you have to look at the change we made in the pension plan last quarter and the impact that had on the overall pension cost as a big part of that. We also did see, from the non-op standpoint, we did see a discount rate reduction, which would have driven up the non-op pension costs for the period.","On the Ag depreciation amortization, we fully amortized licensing agreements and so you saw the reduction because of that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What are the annualized benefits of those, the reduction in amortization and your change in pension accounting?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. I don't have that handy, Jeff. I'd have to get back to you on that piece.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning. Just wondering, the volume performance in E&C and PM obviously was very strong and it was good in the fourth quarter, but the sequential improvement \u2013 it seems to me that it was better than you expected. It certainly was better than we expected. Can you talk about what specifically drove it? And I guess if you're guiding it to normalize a bit in the second quarter, maybe you could just walk us through those dynamics and help us better understand what's going on volumetrically. Thanks.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes, it's Ed. It was higher than we thought. Sales were up 13%. I would add, by the way, the comp was a little easier in the first quarter from last year. We had a very light first quarter last year, but the strength was pretty broad based. Consumer electronics was very strong, semiconductor was strong, photovoltaic was strong and so it was pretty broad based.","Again, I don't think consumer electronics is going to necessarily stay up at that level through the year, that's certainly not what the macro forecasts say, but it definitely was better than we were planning on.","Operator","And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","On the Q2 guidance, a little bit lighter than we had, was there much \u2013 can you comment on is it higher raw material costs are holding you back a little bit, maybe some pull forward of some earnings into Q1? Any further thoughts on the Q2 guide?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. David, this is Nick. If you look at Q1, Q2, I think you really have to look at it at the half-year point and that's kind of how we've depicted it for you for the reasons that I'll talk.","I mean, when you look at revenue, there's some revenue \u2013 Northern Hemisphere of Ag is a big part of obviously the first half. And trying to cut it between what's going to happen in the first quarter and the second quarter, extremely difficult to do.","In Performance Materials, you had a rather strong first quarter auto builds, up dramatically, and probably the first quarter is going to be the highest quarter for auto builds of the whole year. Couple that with some of the raw material things you're seeing; you're seeing some increases in some of the raws around Performance Materials, around benzene and butadiene in the second quarter, but again that could be just a peak in the quarter and we see things coming to a more normalized level as you go forward beyond that.","You also have the ethylene cracker, the turnaround that's going to happen in the second quarter for Performance Materials. So you have a number of dynamics that are playing there that are impacting first, second quarter kind of balance or shift and that's why I'd like to talk about it as the first half, you see a 16% increase year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. So, Ed, you've had a year and a half to mull over this merger and to figure out what configuration creates the most value. And to this end, when does it make sense to define a business by the end market it serves versus the underlying chemistry? For example, both Dow and DuPont sell significant products into autos and electronics end markets. Why would one be in materials Co and the other one in specialty Co?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well, you are correct. I've had a long time to mull a lot of things over with the merger, but the good news is we're getting close and we're highly confident on our August merge date.","As far as the portfolio goes, as we've mentioned before on calls when we're asked, that's a decision of the DowDuPont merge Co Board when we get together. And if there's something compelling to board as far as the mix of business goes, we can certainly look at that and address it. But I would remind you, it also takes two-thirds vote of the merge Co board to make a change to the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Ed, I was wondering if you could tell us when we might hear the names of that new board. And then secondly, in the U.S., your volumes were relatively anemic. Is there something in particular to the quarter or any particular end markets or would you expect to start seeing a little bit more percolation in your North American volumes?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. I would think the board is going to be announced in the very near future, certainly at least 30 days before we merge, but possibly even before that. And the business being \u2013 you just saw our growth in all other regions around the world was very strong, Asia, Europe. Europe, up 5% and U.S. flat, but it was all predominantly or mostly all Ag. And Jim could comment on that.","If you actually look at our specialty products, we were up a little bit in the U.S., but the pressure was on the Ag side there.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. Bob, this is Jim. That shift that we're seeing in the market from corn acres to soybean acres clearly affects our volumes in the first quarter, and soy business tends to favor second quarter just timing of those shipments.","The other thing we had going on is we've pursued kind of a value, not a volume strategy in North America, so \u2013 and there was a lot of discounting going on in the marketplace and we didn't go chasing after a lot of that volume. And so that showed up in those volume numbers as well.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","And I think you'll see about \u2013 if you take Ag out of U.S., Canada and look at it, you'll see a 2% to 3% growth rate in the rest of the businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. Just given the recent changes to portfolio composition of the combined entity as well as amount of shift in the timeline, can you just update us broadly on your revenue synergy targets, including any just broad teams' segment initiatives and just rough estimated cadence, if there is any yet? Thank you.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. We've estimated the growth synergies which, by the way, I'm really excited to start working on here in the near future. We've tagged a lot of areas we're going to go after, but as you know from a legal standpoint, some of this were not allowed to get the teams together and talk about in detail yet, but the biggest area for upside revenue opportunities is clearly on the Ag side and I'll let Jim comment on that in a moment.","But we're also very excited. We've got six or seven programs kind of lined up on the electronics side by putting the two businesses together. Again, we can't get into the detail yet, but we have some good ideas there. We're going to have a much broader offering to our end customers in that area.","Then on the Materials side, as was mentioned, we've got some real good opportunities on the auto side with the breadth of the portfolio from both Dow and DuPont. But, Jim, you could give a little more detail on Ag.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Sure. I think several of the growth opportunities sit in managing our retail branding strategy associated with the different seed brands that we'll have out there. I'm excited about pursuing some mixture opportunities by looking at the old company's portfolio of actives ingredients and seeing how we might make unique mixtures for the market to create more choices in some of these areas.","I like the strength. When I start to compare the two companies and I think about relative markets, for instance, some company is \u2013 one company is a little stronger in one country versus another, but now you bring a broader portfolio into that country and we're able to leverage it.","And then, finally, just thinking about pipelines both on seed and crop protection going forward, how do we lever that to get them out faster, create more opportunities in the marketplace, especially when we're looking at Enlist, that E3 Chemcast (32:56) lineup. I think it's a real great opportunity to push that much stronger, much faster.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Jim, following the sale of semi crop protection chemical business to FMC, can you update us on the original $1.3 billion Ag synergy target? What is that now? And then, can you also remind us for every million acre shift in the U.S. from corn to soy, what's the earnings impact on Ag?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","This is Ed. Let me hit the first part of that and Jim can handle the second. As far as the synergies go, we're at the $3 billion target number. We obviously always knew there would be a remedy coming, didn't know exactly what it was, but we had clearly been overshooting internally on the target.","So our new targets are that materials Co is going to have $1.6 billion of synergies. Ag is going to have $1 billion of synergies. So Jim is down $300 million because of the remedy, but Materials is up $100 million. And then we're up in spec Co now to $400 million in synergies, which gets us to the $300 million \u2013 $3 billion, excuse me.","And we literally have a little over 500 projects on the synergy work laid out in the playbook ready to go, identified how much it is, what it is and who are the personnel responsible for accomplishing that. So, we're excited to get going on that once we merge.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","And, Don, on that shift from corn to soybeans, our order book is tracking pretty consistently with the estimates that we're seeing from USDA, about a 4% decline in corn acres and inspecting about a 7% increase in soybean acres. And as we take a look at that, for every million acre or so change in that shift, it's about a couple of cents impact per share, and that changes a little bit up and down based on cost of goods and the relative volumes, but overall I think it's in that ballpark.","Operator","And our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. It's (35:25) on for Frank. I was hoping you guys could elaborate on the integration of FMC's nutrition business with yours and maybe explain some of the products you're excited about and how it will benefit your platform. Thanks.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. Well, just to clarify here that transaction, we'll close the merger in August. And in the fourth quarter around November, we'll close the FMC transaction. So we've got a little bit of time. We're doing a lot of planning around it as we speak.","We've worked on synergies on that coming into our business, but synergies will be lower than normal because we are planning on adding additional R&D capability on to the FMC part of the platform to really juice that up. And so, we're doing a lot of thinking and work around that right now.","I also remind you we have about 95% of that \u2013 the FMC platform coming over, but it does not include the Omega-3 business, which we did not want in there. So, a lot of sales planning going on, planning around increasing R&D capability.","And we're \u2013 probably the one area we're most excited about, we were at DuPont working our way into the pharma market, and FMC has a great presence and a nice percentage of their portfolio is in the pharma area already. So we can leverage our R&D work into their sales channel platform and that's one of the real nice upsides for us.","Operator","And our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Your price cuts in seeds are flat. Can you talk about how much price mix you got from two specific products, your Leptra corn and Xtend soybeans? And how much (37:34) are you able to charge per acre?","Then secondly related to Ag, you talked about your inventories being high in Latin America. Where do they stand now and should they be normalizing by end of the season? Thank you.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah, P.J. So you mentioned a couple of key pricing opportunities that we definitely have had and it's allowed us to improve mix. One is Leptra in Brazil coming out of the safrinha season and as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we had double-digit growth in pricing there.","And in North America, you're right. We are seeing some lift in \u2013 with the opportunity with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend and beginning to fully deploy that trait. And then we will see some benefits from access to Intacta in Brazil going forward. So, I think all of that is good. Clearly, in North America, I mentioned there's been a lot of discounting as well. So on average, about flat, you're right.","And what was the second question? Latin America, sorry. So, you're right. We still are seeing some elevated levels of inventories in Brazil, primarily mostly with our insecticides portfolio, but we really are working through those now. We made production adjustments to compensate for that.","And I'd say we get through this season, we ought to be trending back to more normal levels. Everywhere else in the world, I'm feeling pretty good about where we sit inventory-wise on our crop protection and seed business.","Operator","And our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Good morning.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Good morning.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, in Performance Materials, I think you guys have previously said that you are mainly present in the high-end auto market, so particularly the luxury cars here in Europe and U.S. But in your guidance today, you're talking about how auto sales are driven by China. Can you talk a little bit how that geographic mix makes a difference for you?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well, we're not in high end; we're in high-value use products. So, for instance, we're not on the bumpers or something like that, but you're in under the hood where they have the extreme temperatures, et cetera. So, it's not luxury ends; it's just high-value end use sort of products.","In being that, we would be impacted by the overall auto builds in general and so we did see a rather strong growth in auto in the first quarter. We also continue to see some market share gain as people adapt our products in replacing metal parts under the hood.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Coming back to the Ag business, with the divestiture, can you give a feel for the cadence of tailwinds that your business has from the ramp of recent product launches and how do you compare the strength of what you're seeing in 2017 compared to what you expect for 2018 and 2019 based on what you will be launching in the expected ramp schedules?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Laurence, clearly in our performance right now, there are some insecticide sales that are tied to the products that are part of the remedy. But don't forget, we're also getting some new products back into our current mix, Vydate, in this quarter now fully back in by the end of the year., we'd expect to be back to close to 100% supplied for the market on Vydate. So, I've got some offsets coming there.","But, really, you step back from current and take a look at the pipeline. And as I mentioned in my comments, that pipeline that's in the slide deck is the pipeline that will be a part of the new company at merge, and there's $20 billion worth of peak sales coming out of that pipeline over the planning horizon.","So, remember, we retained essentially the near-term products, late-stage candidates that were in the pipeline that we'll be launching here over the next several years. So, actually, I'm quite excited about what that potential looks like.","Operator","And our next question is from Alex Yefremov from Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning. Thank you. Want to ask about Encirca. How big do you expect this business to be in terms of sales by the end of this year? And what are your long-term goals perhaps in three years to five years? Do you expect this to be one of your major growth drivers for your Ag business in the long term?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Great question. We sold Encirca services on over 2 million acres in 2016 and I think our original plan for last year was about 1.5 million that we talked about, so we outperformed our plans. The team is excited about the start for this year and we expect to double that again in 2017. So we're on about that cadence.","What also affects that ramp rate is the number of different services that we offer. So, right now, we're offering about five unique types of services to six unique types of services and we have programs in the pipeline that are coming. So each one of those gives us a new revenue opportunity to add to the overall mix.","And then, we're constantly looking out there at the industry for other folks to collaborate with as we go through this. So, I'm excited about the next few years. We've begun to model the revenue growth consistent kind of with our recent performance into that and we'll keep you posted as the program rolls out.","Operator","Our next question is from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Could you break out what your crop protection prices and volumes were in the quarter as well as your second quarter outlook? And also, you made some comments specifically on insecticides, how was your herbicide outlook?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Herbicides, I'd say we're excited about our presence in corn and soybeans. We probably felt a slower start this year in cereal herbicides, some of the Northern European cereal crops were a little bit slower and I think you'll \u2013 several of the others in the industry have talked about that as well.","Overall, in crop protection, I think our volumes \u2013 I feel good about that. Volumes have been up and prices are still a challenge. It's a tough market and we've talked about that before that especially as we get commodity prices down in the low end of their trading ranges, growers can typically substitute or go on a cheaper side with some of their crop protection, because it's about the last thing that they apply. And they take care of fuel and land and rent and seed, and usually it's that last purchase of crop protection that takes the brunt of that. So we're seeing some of that in this season.","Operator","Our next question is from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. You just have stronger-than-anticipated auto and electronic markets. Has there been any change to your initial guidance for GDP growth at 2.7% and IP growth at 2.4%?","And then, we could conceivably see a 600 million bushel to 700 million bushel carryout for U.S. soy in 2017, 2018. What kind of cost tailwind could this provide for your Ag business next year and should we expect some of these benefits to also filter through to Nutrition & Health?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well, let me get the first one, then I'll turn it to Jim for the second. When you look at the \u2013 some of the macros that you point to, industrial production and GDP, in general, we see those in line with what we said at the first of the year.","Industrial production I think is up slightly. It went from the 2.4% that you mentioned, we're now in the 2.5% range for industrial production. But obviously, some of this is going to vary dependent upon which part of the world we're talking about. And so, it depends on the geographic presence.","We are seeing some strong growth in Asia Pacific. It's actually the best region overall from a growth perspective, looking at some of those macros, with industrial production now estimated just under 5%, 4.8%, and it's really led by China where the industrial production is viewed at about 6%.","GDP there is in close to the 5% as well, 4.8%. So it really depends on the region of the world as we look at it. And then, Jim, why don't you handle the second part?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. On cost of goods, you're right. If you look back into 2016, you saw that spike in soybean prices over the summer. I think growers were very excited about that, but we're typically contracting and buying our soybeans at about the same time.","So, as we talked about in the script, you could hear it in our first quarter discussion. We faced some headwinds from COGS, especially in soybeans. So some of that is the commodity price that's built into there.","But the other part of that story is the royalty rates that we pay on those products. So, if you think about the carryout, as you suggested, going forward in 2017 purchases, we'll expect to buy beans cheaper as we contract, assuming the commodity prices stay in about the range that they're in right now. However, that could be offset slightly by the fact that our royalty rate is going up as we ramp a larger presence in the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend profile as well as Intacta acres in Latin America.","Operator","And our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Just wondering on 2017 how you're tracking versus your internal kind of cost reduction targets and what your future ongoing view is there, as well as on the cash that you are building now, what we could expect for that use post-merger. Thanks.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well, on the cost reductions, we're tracking very well against the goals that were set originally. You saw in the quarter, we had our period costs. Our total fixed cost was $26 million below what it was in the prior year, and that $26 million had some costs incurred in it that were somewhat unusual, if you will, or certainly weren't anticipated in the prior year when we set the targets.","For example, you had the variable compensation increase that occurred in the quarter given the strong earnings performance that are showing thus far in the year. You also had the route-to-market changes that we've made in Ag that we've spoken about, which is very positive from an overall earnings and strategic direction, but did add some additional fixed cost to us that we now need to overcome as well.","And so the $26 million reduction in year-over-year cost is right in line with what our target was for the year and so we're feeling very good about being able to realize all those. And the second part of your question was what again? I'm sorry.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Cash for the merger.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","If you look at the cash position that we have, we're feeling good about where we are. Free cash flow improved by $200 million as we mentioned. This is our normal usage of cash type season where we have the need for supporting the Ag working capital needs in this part of the year.","Overall, working capital, we're seeing things continue to be positive. Our balances, if you look at our trade working capitals at the end of the quarter versus the same period last year, we saw improvements primarily in inventory and accounts payable. Those were the two areas we saw most of the improvement. But if you were to look at the turnovers, for example, and calculate the working capital turnovers, it's about a 10% improvement of where we are this year versus last when you adjust for the Chemours working capital impact.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. And then, I would just add specifically as we get to merge, obviously, we'll have to take that up with the DowDuPont Board at that point in time. And one of the things we'll have to visit with the new board on is share repurchase as one example because that has to be a decision of the new board. So, we'll be making those decisions later in the summer.","Operator","Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Two questions. First on Ag. Jim, as you're now selling the Xtend, what do you think the farmer behavior is going to be around bundling your FeXapan with that versus do you think the farmer is going to make an \u00e0 la carte decision where the brand of herbicide doesn't matter from where they buy the seed?","And then the second one is, shutting down the world-scale Cooper River plant, what does that tell us about the future of the competitive dynamics in Kevlar?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Jim?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. Great. Duffy, this is Jim. The FeXapan is, as you know, one of several products that will be on the market to be at \u2013 that will be \u2013 have a label to be able to apply over-the-top of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. So, we brought the offering. It's an opportunity to represent a full spectrum of choices to our customers. And I think as they step back and look at the value proposition that we're able to put together, we hope they choose our products. But we don't have any of those kind of programs that you're talking about.","And then I just think the performance of the product, but in addition to that, it's the stewardship, right? It's the field-level support that our team is able to bring to that grower to help \u2013 shepherd them through the launch of this new technology is going to be important part of that as well.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes. And the second part of your question, Duffy, the Cooper River shutdown was I think pretty simple for us from a dollars and cents standpoint. We're going to get a really nice cost savings from it. We have capacity in our large Spruance facility and we're going to be moving our production there.","And we're also \u2013 Spruance and specifically those lines on Kevlar and, by the way, Tyvek also is where we're really working on our capacity release program we've talked about on the operations side. So we expect to be able to even free up more capacity on the existing lines, so the leverage we're going to get on our gross margins is pretty nice in that area and that's why we made the decision.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","And we'll do our last question.","Operator","It's from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. First, a question on Ag and then I have a follow-up on Materials. I think you've been planning on three major locations in Ag with a headquarters in Wilmington. With the divestment to FMC, does that structure still make sense?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. This is Jim. It does. We'll always talk about having a light presence as a headquarters presence here in Wilmington. A lot of the corporate functional needs that DuPont already has today are based here, so things like tax, treasury and audit, investor relations, core HR capabilities. And so, we wanted to tap into the talent that we had here in Wilmington and utilize that.","The remedy part of that divestiture obviously was a big chunk of the DuPont crop protection R&D resources that are based at Stine and there had always been a plan, as we had been evaluating options there, for where those resources might migrate, whether we would keep a small core here in Wilmington, but also utilize facilities in Indianapolis and Des Moines. So the remedy really doesn't change the plans around the headquarters, but it does modify those resources that we might have available that would be moving from R&D.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then in Performance Materials, a little surprised, price was flat. Oil is up a lot from where it was in the first quarter of 2016 and prices for most polymers have been moving up over the past year. And then over in Protection Solutions, we have a lot of polymer-based materials as well. Price is actually down 2%. So, is that a mix effect or what's going on there with price?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well, a lot of that is a mix effect. You also have the constraints that we have because of the oncoming tar and the planning ahead for that in the market and the ability to sell those pounds as a result. So the big part of it is, is that prep as well as the mix effect.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Okay. Well, that concludes our Q&A session today. Thank you for dialing into the call and thank you for your interest in DuPont. John, back to you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Sandra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Third Quarter 2012 Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] To listen to the webcast, please go to www.dupont.com.","Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you may begin your conference.","Karen A. Fletcher","Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. With me today are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO. The slides for today's call can be found on our website, along with the news release that was issued earlier today.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website. As a reminder, our comments on today's call regarding earnings are on an underlying basis. Please see Schedules B and C in the earnings news release for a listing of significant items and their impact by segment. Additionally, comments on today's call regarding company results are on a continuing operations basis unless specifically noted otherwise. We've posted supplemental information on our website including company restatements that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us. In a few minutes, we'll walk through our results for the quarter and provide color on markets and business performance. Before we do that, I want to discuss our actions to build and deliver value for shareholders, as we sharpen our competitiveness and confront our most immediate challenges. We continue to manage the company knowing that sustained growth and competitiveness require a dynamic, agile organization that is deeply connected to customers and markets. Our businesses and corporate functions are constantly working towards that goal. This is how we step up to market challenges, outperform the competition and grow. Continuing macroeconomic uncertainty and resulting slowing demand in certain sectors are reminders of why agility and productivity must be a way of life.","Today, we are announcing additional actions we have launched to improve competitiveness and accelerate market-driven innovation and growth by fine-tuning the organization, eliminating cost and expanding targeted productivity programs. This effort is somewhat surgical in that each of our businesses have assessed what action, if any, is warranted versus their market condition and competitive set. Our actions reflect differential management of the portfolio and not a one-size-fits-all approach.","I'd like to underscore some of the more important elements of what we're doing. Recent transactions involving Performance Coatings and Danisco advance DuPont's vision to be the world's most dynamic science company, with a long-term strategy of driving competitive advantage in Agriculture & Nutrition, Advanced Materials and Industrial Biotechnology, all of which represent high growth, high-margin opportunities. Over time, you will begin to see the full effect of these transactions as we redeploy capital and fully integrate Danisco and Solae, generating new growth opportunities in high-margin parts of our business.","We set aggressive cost targets for these transactions. In the case of Danisco, we're delivering $130 million in cost synergies by year end, well ahead of the original schedule. In the case of DPC, we will eliminate $230 million in residual costs associated with the divestiture. We will take the same disciplined approach to eliminate these costs as we have in addressing the Danisco cost synergies.","Based on what we learned during the separation process, we identified additional actions to reduce corporate costs to further simplify and streamline our global infrastructure. We are better aligning the design and cost of corporate functions with business growth strategies and the expected impact of changing market conditions. In addition, current uncertainty in the global economic outlook, softer demand in certain markets and strength in others require realigning business resources to match current growth opportunities and increase responsiveness to rapidly changing market realities. Businesses have identified cost-saving opportunities by optimizing supply chains, consolidating facilities and refining their organizations geographically to improve competitiveness and margins. It's important to recognize that these actions unlock capital, drive science-powered innovation and will deliver growth faster. In order to ensure continued competitiveness at both the function and business levels, our leaders identified actions to deliver $220 million in savings. This combines with the elimination of $230 million in residual costs for a total of $450 million in benefits.","This restructuring work is in addition to ongoing productivity programs that address cost and working capital. All these actions are part of a continuum for DuPont, but they obviously take on particular importance given the quarter's results. Business results in the third quarter reflect continued weak market conditions in Europe and uncertainty in Asia. The bright spots were strong performance in Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials. The most challenged segments this quarter were Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications.","Agriculture market fundamentals remained strong, supported by robust demand and a healthy outlook for farm income. You will recall, last year, this segment delivered outstanding growth in sales and earnings in Latin America. And despite such a strong third quarter comp and a 10% currency headwind, Ag sales were up 4% this quarter. We remain bullish about the growth opportunities for our Seed & Crop Protection businesses, as the Latin American planting season continues in the fourth quarter and the northern hemisphere season gets underway. And we are bullish on the solid momentum we have heading into 2013.","Our Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences segment grew 10% and 5%, respectively, when excluding currency impact. Both businesses delivered impressive earnings growth, with PTOI margin expansion of 300 basis points in the quarter. These results demonstrate outstanding work by the businesses to deliver customer value through innovation and deliver cost synergies from the Danisco acquisition ahead of schedule.","Performance Chemicals earnings were down 37%, which reflected earnings decline in both businesses within the segment. Weaker economic conditions, particularly in China and Europe, are reducing demand for TiO2 and fluoropolymers, specifically connected to construction and infrastructure. These businesses continue to focus on customer service, drive fixed cost and working capital productivity and, in the case of TiO2, reduce cost by shifting to lower cost or blends.","Electronics & Communications earnings decline was essentially all related to weak photovoltaic markets and an oversupply of PV modules. Trade actions in the United States and trade investigations in the European Union add to market uncertainty and are negatively impacting demand. The bright spot in the segment was the consumer electronics market bolstered by demand for smartphones and tablets.","Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Nick to go through third quarter financials. And after the segment reviews, I'll share perspectives on key markets going forward. Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Underlying earnings from continuing operations of $0.32 per share were down $0.28 versus the prior year. This decline reflects the market conditions that Ellen just covered, as well as $0.28 of headwinds from currency, taxes, lower pharmaceutical income, noncash pension costs and exchange losses.","Consolidated net sales of $7.4 billion were down 9% versus the prior year. Volume declined 5% as increases in Agriculture, Performance Materials and Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. Volume in Asia-Pacific declined 10%, primarily due to lower TiO2 and photovoltaic materials volume. Excluding Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications, Asia-Pacific volume was up slightly year-over-year.","Local selling prices increased 1% with declines in Asia-Pacific partially offsetting gains in the other regions. The single largest driver for the drop in local prices in Asia-Pacific resulted from the decrease in silver cost, related to our Solamet paste, which as we've discussed with you before, is passed through direct to the customer. For more information regarding the company's sales by geographic region, please see Slide 4.","As Ellen mentioned earlier, today, we announced a restructuring plan, which is summarized on Slide 5. This plan will deliver total pretax cost savings of $450 million by eliminating corporate cost previously allocated to Performance Coatings, while taking additional cost-cutting actions to improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver $300 million of savings in 2013 and the full amount in 2014.","Our targets have been established from the bottom up, with specific projects already identified and rigorous monitoring and accountability in place. To achieve these savings, we expect to record a restructuring charge of about $210 million; $152 million of this charge was recorded in the third quarter with the balance to come in quarter 4. These actions will make us a leaner, more agile company and better position all of our businesses for future growth.","I'd like to point out that the savings associated with the restructuring plan will essentially offset the dilutive earnings effect associated with the divesting of the Performance Coatings business. And speaking of the Performance Coatings divestiture, the transaction is progressing as planned, and we expect to close the sale in the first quarter of next year. We estimate the after-tax proceeds will be about $4 billion. This is a preliminary figure, recognizing the tax calculation is complex and involves many factors that are not yet finalized. We'll provide you a final number when the sale closes.","Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 6, which is shown on a continuing-operations basis. First, higher local selling prices resulting in a $0.05 per share benefit. Excluding currency, variable costs were a $0.17 tailwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were down about 5% versus the prior year. While we recognize these costs will be lower in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an increase of about 1% for the full year. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, our overall 5% volume decline reduced earnings by $0.15 per share.","Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, excluding currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects 3% of higher noncash pension cost and a $0.02 lower plant utilization charges, as well as higher spending on growth investments, primarily R&D and marketing initiatives in the Agricultural segment. The lower plant utilization charges did not represent increases in spending, but rather, were primarily the result of lower volumes in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. These are a fixed manufacturing cost, normally reflected in inventory that are expensed when production rates drop below normal operating levels. This helps to ensure our inventory values are not inflated. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we have delivered approximately $285 million of fixed cost productivity to date, well on our way towards exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year. I'd like to reiterate what Ellen said earlier. The restructuring plan we announced today is in addition to these ongoing productivity programs.","Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.13 variance in the quarter. As current -- at current exchange rates, we expect about $0.27 headwind for the full year on a continuing-operations basis. This equates to about a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.","Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.02 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the extent that our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.","Income tax was a $0.05 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate of 24% this quarter and 17% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in high tax-rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of the U.S. R&D credit and other tax provisions, which expired at the end of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect the base tax rate on a continuing ops basis to be about 22%.","Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We continue to expect full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million or $225 million less than that in 2011.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. Third quarter free cash flow, on a total company basis, was about $250 million or $350 million less than last year. On a year-to-date basis, total company free cash flow was about $800 million lower than last year, primarily reflecting the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. Pension Plan that we made earlier this year, as well as some other onetime item payments.","In light of our current operating environment, we have reduced our planned capital expenditures for the full year to about $1.9 billion or 10% below our previous guidance. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A\/A2 rating and work to maintain the associated metrics that support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.","Last month, we paid our 432nd consecutive quarterly dividend.","In summary, for the third quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Our businesses executed well, as they faced a wide array of market conditions. Each business has externally benchmarked performance targets against which they are all executing well while outperforming their peer set.","Turning now to the rest of the year on Slide 8. We expect the full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations to be $3.25 to $3.30 per share, excluding significant items. This outlook primarily reflects sequential lower earnings in Performance Chemicals and Agriculture in the fourth quarter versus the third. Karen will provide some more detail when she covers the segments.","Lastly, I want to take a moment to reflect on how the recent portfolio and restructuring actions fit with our long-term strategy. The DPC divestiture, coupled with the Danisco acquisition last year, are consistent with our intent to focus on high-growth, high-margin opportunities with innovation critical to success. Today's announcement around restructuring actions will help mitigate the earnings dilution from the DPC divestiture, while positioning our businesses to be more agile and profitable long term. In addition, we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of our strong balance sheet. Our focus on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success.","With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review the segments. Karen.","Karen A. Fletcher","Thanks, Nick. Turning to Slide 9. Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half, underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against the backdrop of tight global grain stocks and sound market fundamentals. Third quarter sales of $1.4 billion grew 4%, with gains in volume and local price partially offset by currency, primarily the Brazilian real. Typical seasonal losses increased to $85 million, as sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency, continued investment in research, selling and agronomy positions in our North America and Brazil businesses and multiple product launch activities.","Reviewing the individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $601 million were up 1%. Volume gains and insect control products and fungicides led the way with local pricing gains in all segments, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Regionally, we grew in the key markets of the United States, Latin America and Europe, overcoming the negative effects of currency. Our blockbuster insect control products powered by Rynaxypyr are on pace to grow 20% this year. In the third quarter, we successfully launched Cyazypyr insect control products in Argentina and Dermacor insect control seed treatment in Mexico. We continue to pursue registrations of these complementary insect control portfolios in additional countries and markets. In combination, these new innovative technologies derived from the same novel chemical class are on track to achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual portfolio of sales in the next few years.","Moving to the seed business. Third quarter sales grew to $822 million, up 6%. The quarter reflected strong performance in Latin America, South Africa and South Asia. In Brazil, summer season corn sales are up despite hectares shifting from corn to soybeans. We expect pricing and share gains in summer corn, following a successful 2012 Safrinha season. These successes are the result of a multiyear plan to invest in our research, production and go-to-market capabilities. Growers continue to see robust performance and insect control with our hybrids containing the Herculex 1 insect trait. This summer, we've expanded grower options as we launched Optimum Intrasect in Brazil with 2 modes of action for aboveground insect control. Recent investments in soybean production and distribution capacity are also paying off, as Brazilian growers are increasing demand for locally developed, high-yielding, high-quality pioneer brand soybeans. The USDA won't issue final 2012 acreage until January of next year, so we can share some preliminary results based upon the recent October report. We held North America corn market share flat in 2012, following gains of 6 points since 2008. Double-digit pricing gains and the highest planting corn acres since 1937 resulted in significant growth in corn sales. Soybeans also experienced significant sales growth from improved price realization and higher planted acres. Soybean market share is projected to be flat to slightly down, following gains of more than 10 points since 2008.","Finally, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which has advanced this year due to the early planting season and the widespread drought conditions. Growers planted Optimum AQUAmax on over 2 million acres in 2012. And these products performed exceptionally well. AQUAmax hybrids stayed healthier longer and, most importantly, delivered more bushels at harvest. On more than 4,000 side-by-side comparisons with competitive products, preliminary 2012 yield data shows an advantage of more than 8% with AQUAmax products in water-limited environments.","Our Optimum AcreMax 1 and AcreMax XTRA triple-stacked hybrids, containing the Herculex rootworm trait, performed well under this year's heavy corn rootworm infestation and drought stress. We'll round out the lineup in 2013 with the addition of Optimum AcreMax XTreme, which contains dual modes of action for both above- and below-ground insect control. AcreMax XTreme recently received all necessary regulatory approvals for grain import into major world markets. So we look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest results in the next few weeks.","Moving now to the segment outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect significant sales increases versus a tough prior year comp. Seasonal fourth quarter losses will be substantially larger year-over-year and about double the size of the third quarter loss, as sales growth is moderated by higher production costs, new product launches in Crop Protection & Pioneer and continued growth investments. We now expect full year margins for the segment to be about flat year-over-year, which actually is an improved outlook from earlier this year and a tribute to solid execution by both businesses.","Looking forward to 2013, the fundamentals for Agriculture remains strong, as we prepare for the upcoming Safrinha season in Brazil and the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere. Our teams are working diligently with farmers to supply them with the seeds, crop protection products and knowledge to meet the world's growing need for feed, food and renewable resources.","Moving to Slide 10 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $607 million were down 28%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver cost pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials declined due to inventory destocking throughout the PV value chain. In addition, trade actions in the United States and investigations in Europe are creating downward pressure on end-use demand. In consumer electronics, we continue to see strong demand for our market-leading materials, fueled by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. And our packaging graphics business remains stable.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be essentially flat with a substantial earnings decline. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2011 results included a $20 million licensing payment. If we exclude this item, earnings would be up substantially.","With respect to the photovoltaic market, we lowered our outlook for PV installations in the second half, reflecting today's market environment and pending trade actions. Our current estimate is that global PV installation rates for 2012 will be flat to low single digits, depending on the fourth quarter installation rates. There are no major subsidies expiring at year-end, which has historically caused spikes in fourth quarter demand. DuPont products like Solamet and Tedlar remained industry leaders, and we are committed to our mission of being the leading supplier of differentiated materials for photovoltaics and consumer and other electronic markets.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $292 million were flat, as 7% volume growth was offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Volume growth occurred in all regions and reflects continued strong demand for DuPont Sorona renewably sourced polymer for carpet fiber and growth in key enzyme businesses from new product launches. PTOI of $42 million was up $8 million or 24% on higher volume and the realization of cost synergies related to the integration of the Danisco enzyme business. Enzyme sales for ethanol were significantly lower, as spreads between ethanol and corn prices continue to challenge the ethanol industry.","Moving to the fourth quarter, we see sales up moderately and PTOI up substantially, as we continue to realize cost synergies from integration. As a result of these productivity gains and improved margins in biomaterials, full year margin is expected to be up over 3 percentage points compared to prior year.","Now let's turn to Slide 12 for Nutrition & Health. Strong execution in the quarter resulted in the business posting sales of $876 million, with earnings of $87 million, which are up 58%. All product lines contributed to solid 4% volume growth, led by enablers, Solae soy specialties, probiotics, cultures and sweeteners. Local pricing improved in all regions as continued mix enrichment and pricing actions, in response to key raw material increases, were offset by the negative effect of currency. Our global teams continue to focus on growing the business, while integration remains on track to deliver meaningful revenue and cost synergies.","Our innovation and productivity mindset is evident, as full year margins will be about 10%, which is a 3 percentage-point improvement over 2011.","Moving to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect moderate sales growth, despite the impact of currency, and substantial earnings growth, with the benefit of continued cost synergies. Sequential margins will be pressured down in the fourth quarter due to raw material inflation.","Now, let's discuss Performance Chemicals on Slide 13. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 19% with 18% lower volume and 1% lower selling price versus an extremely tough comp in 2011. Titanium dioxide and fluoropolymer volumes were pressured by a decline in spending in infrastructure and construction in Asia-Pacific and ongoing weakness in Europe. PTOI of $372 million was down 37%, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable currency. One bright spot was the continued robust demand in industrial chemicals for cyanide and aniline. Despite the weaker quarter, year-to-date segment PTOI is down only modestly when compared to last year's strong earnings performance.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down significantly and earnings down substantially. We expect continued softness, while TiO2 producers reduce existing inventory levels. On a positive note, customer inventory levels have declined from previous highs and long-term industry fundamentals remain solid. Long-term growth remains tightly correlated to GDP. So for now, we continue to stay close to customers and drive productivity. And we look for this market to bottom in the first half of next year. We see several potential triggers for recovery, including new investment in Asia infrastructure, some stability in Europe and the continued recovery and growth in the U.S. housing market.","Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales of $1.6 billion were down 8%, primarily due to lower selling prices and currency. Packaging volumes remained stable, and modest improvement in automotive were partially offset by unfavorable currency and softness in Asia-Pacific electronic markets. PTOI of $306 million increased $75 million on value pricing, lower feedstock costs and positive mix. Continuing productivity efforts also contributed to margin expansion.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down modestly, with global auto builds flat and continued soft demand in industrial and electronics markets. We expect PTOI to be up substantially versus weak comps on lower costs and value pricing.","On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales declined 7% on 4% lower selling prices due to unfavorable currency and 3% lower volume. The volume decline was primarily due to stalled infrastructure projects in China, weaker industrial conditions in Europe and the U.S. Military delaying tender on orders. PTOI was down 13% primarily due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency.","For the fourth quarter, sales are expected to be essentially flat. We see continued softness in industrial markets and inconsistent spending in the public sector. With the continued new home construction rebound in the U.S., we are seeing a pickup in sales of Tyvek HomeWrap. While this is off a very small base and we do not foresee this being a big needle mover in the near term, we expect the increased demand in this market will continue into 2013. Fourth quarter PTOI is expected to be down moderately due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. Going forward, S&P will see significant productivity improvement in the future years from the restructuring plan that we announced today.","So with that, I conclude the segment update and turn the call over for Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen. Staying ahead of market trends and taking action to position ourselves well for what lies ahead are cornerstones of how we operate. As we head into the fourth quarter and beyond, we are laser-focused on those principles that keep us competitive and drive our growth. We continue to execute well in most parts of the company. And certain segments such as Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials are outperforming despite market volatility and soft macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing our challenges head-on. We must continue to stay close to customers. We do this routinely to understand their needs and develop new products that capitalize fully on market rebound and support attractive margins. This connection is also how we gain insight on demand signals, which is critically important when markets are volatile. Our focus on market-driven innovation and the new products we deliver are intrinsic to several opportunities we see for growth, heading into next year.","First, our Agriculture business is poised to pay us $10 billion in sales this year. We're heading into 2013 with strong momentum. We've made tremendous progress in our Seed Genetics and our Crop Protection pipeline over the past decade and been rewarded with market share and excellent growth in the U.S. and internationally. And this includes very attractive returns. Everything is in place to continue that track record next year.","Second, 2013 is a foundational year for some of the important long-term growth opportunities in industrial biotechnologies and OLED. There are short-term milestones to watch for in these areas that include breaking ground on a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant and steps that we and our partners take to scale up, validate and move closer to commercialization of DuPont OLED technology.","A third opportunity for innovation is in automotive where markets continue to recover, and we're aggressively building on our strong presence. In July, we announced an expansion of our successful innovation center in Nagoya, Japan; and last week, we announced the opening of an automotive innovation center in Detroit. In these centers, we collaborate with customers and tap in to our global network of 9,500 scientists, chemists and engineers to hear directly from our customers and deliver innovative solutions to help them gain competitive advantage.","Overall, our transformation continues. Actions we've taken to differentially manage our portfolio are shifting us steadily towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Ongoing productivity, coupled with restructuring actions announced today, keep us efficient, effective and competitive. And our market-driven innovation continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, providing our customers with the innovative solutions they need to compete and creating value for our shareholders.","So Karen, back to you.","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay, thanks, Ellen. Sandra, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Ellen, I wanted to get a little more color on your TiO2 outlook, specifically, what -- I know you give segment price volume data, but what are you seeing on pricing and volumes? How steep is the downward trajectory this quarter? And how do you see the business unfolding next year?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so certainly, we are in the midst of a changing market condition over this past quarter. Coming through the second quarter, we saw improvement in that market and with kind of a step down in Asia-Pacific and economic activity and infrastructure investment in China. We see -- we saw volumes fall there. You saw the volume decrease, obviously, in the quarter and expect volume and price pressure to continue in the fourth quarter. Sizing that, we have done that in terms of putting forward our guidance for the year-end estimate, and the range that you've seen there is inclusive of what is a substantial decline in Performance Chemicals earnings along with the seasonal losses in Agriculture. As we look out next year, Don, we do see that there are some things moving in the favor of stabilizing forces around TiO2. If you take a look at housing market improving, what, some 21% year-over-year and the season that will come in the U.S. in the second quarter and China, which is expected to resume some infrastructure investment as they're changing government takes place. Customer inventory levels are normalizing. And so, yes, it's going to be a tough end of the year, but we see stabilization occurring in the first half of next year. And as the macroeconomic picture plays out, we can get more specific on that.","Operator","The next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ellen, could you talk about the user proceeds from coatings and potential for share buybacks given your current share price?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, Nick, why don't you start on that one for Dave?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Sure. David, when you think about the proceeds, I talked to you today, about what the dollar value is now sized to be on an after-tax basis. And as I mentioned, we need to finalize that as the sale actually closes. But I think a good basis to be thinking about right now is around that $4 billion number after-tax proceeds. And the first thing we're going to do is, as I mentioned, we want to make sure we maintain that strong balance sheet. The A\/A2 rating is very important to us. So strengthening that balance sheet is one of the key criteria and one of the first things we're going to be looking to do there. Subsequent to that, what we're going to be doing is looking at returning excess cash to our shareholders, as we always talk about doing, unless we have a compelling investment opportunity. That investment opportunity could be capacity increases, could be opportunities around further investments in some of the R&D work. It could be potential acquisitions. So there's a lot of ways in which that could manifest itself. The other thing is, obviously, when you think about returning value to the shareholders, the fact that we've had 432 consecutive dividends displays our commitment to the dividend program and, ultimately, board decision there as to dividend. And share buyback, you mentioned, we have active share buyback programs in place, David, and we continue to operate against those. Primary purpose there is to make sure that we don't have dilution in the earnings from any of the management options that would be exercised over the course of time.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","With regard to your seed business in North America, would you comment on perspective pricing prospects for 2013, relative to the range of positive 5% to 10% that your competitor put out? And specifically address AQUAmax, your yield differential of 8% there. What are you looking at on pricing in acreage for that product, please?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, Kevin, we're really pleased with our Agricultural business has performed through this season and is performing in Latin America. We see that value proposition on the Right Product, Right Acre and the improvements in our product portfolio that Karen mentioned, as she went through the segment remarks, are really having an impact in our position. We have launched our price card. We do price locally. I think that I'm not going to size that today, but \u2018cause we -- we do it on a customer-by-customer basis, and those discussions are going on right now. But I think it's a very positive environment from a value that we will continue to supply next year with our new products, with Xtreme, with AQUAmax. And I can tell you that the early indications are early orders are strong. So we see this environment very positive going forward, and we'll be pricing it as we come through and have that order book filled.","Operator","And the next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A quick question on photovoltaic business. Can you discuss how much of this decline is cyclical versus secular? And when do you think this business can return back to its former level? And then just quickly, Nick, there was a charge in the segment in thin films. Maybe you can add some color to that.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I'll take the first one and Nick can be additive. So I mean if you take a look at PV, we were coming through -- the second half of last year, obviously, there was inventory buildup in the value chain. That was righting itself, and we were seeing improvement in that industry coming through the first half of this year. And then, there is overcapacity from a module standpoint, coupled with trade actions taken that have really created -- the best thing I can call it is confusion, uncertainty that is impacting demand. Now, I think it might take more than a quarter or 2 to play this out. Our expectations, as we look forward, is that these things will work their way out. But our expectations are sales next year, 2013, are going to be flattish with 2012. Now, we do believe, longer term, as this works through, that the \u2013 with where multi-pricing is versus grid parity that we are believers that this industry has a solid future and will continue to get back longer-term to double-digit growth. It's just not going to happen in '13 is our view of the marketplace today. Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","I'm sorry. P.J., on the second piece that you talked about, which is the impairment charge that we took and if you size that, it was $150 million impairment charge relating to this segment, E&C. This related to the thin-film PV modules and systems that we manufacture in China. This did not have anything to do with our materials such as the Solamet or the Tedlar. This was around the thin films module manufacturer. And the reason is what Ellen already articulated for you, the uncertainties going on, the pricing pressures, the margin compressions resulted in us taking that impairment in the quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you remind me of the timing of your TiO2 expansion over the next 2 years? And then secondarily, can you talk about changes in incentive compensation in the third and in the fourth quarter in the light of your earnings, perhaps, not being as strong as you would've initially hoped?","Ellen J. Kullman","So we had a broad program on expansion that included remounts in every facility we have and a second line in Altamira. Those expansions were to take place in '12, '13, and '14, with Altamira scheduled to come on very late '14, early '15 kind of timeframe. This is a business in the market that we evaluate those and bring them on in a very disciplined manner, and we'll continue to gauge the market and that. But we're committed to those expansions and I think that they'll serve us well over the long term, because continued demand at TiO2 is going to continue to grow at about GDP. So whether it's delayed a quarter or whatever, time will tell as this marketplace plays out. But we think it\u2019s solid. Your second question was around the impact of -- well, obviously, our compensation programs will be lower based on the impact of the second half of the year. I'm not sure there's a materiality to the impact on our earnings from that standpoint, but those estimates will be lower as our earnings will be lower for the year.","Operator","And the next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So if you could just provide a little bit more clarification on a couple of the restructuring charges. I'm interested on the S&P side. It looked like that was about 40% of the severance but that segment might be 10% or 15% of sales. So what's causing sort of the excessive adjustment there? And then what is it in industrial polymers that's requiring impairment charges? I thought those markets were maybe a bit healthier so is there 1 or 2 product lines that are causing that?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, Nick, why don't you give us some clarity here?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Sure. I think, Bob, when you look at the overall margins of S&P and you can see what our long-term objectives are and where we\u2019re driving to achieve. Couple that with the market conditions that we're facing right now in the slower \u2013 in the industrial segments, I think you can understand why S&P is driving for some of those restructuring changes and why they represented $55 million out of the total $152 million of charge in the quarter. It's ways that we're going to drive to achieve those long-term margins that we realized or that we projected as the market continues to come back for us. On the polymer side, I think what you're probably referring to is the impairment charge there and that was a $92 million impairment charge and this related to our neoprene facility. This is a product that supplied into the industrial polymers sector of belts for mining industry, that type of thing. And what we've seen there is margins deteriorating, pricing under pressure, raw material increases and those market conditions resulted in us taking that impairment of $92 million in the quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up in terms of metrics on titanium dioxide. You indicated that you saw inventory levels were coming down to more manageable levels. So if you could give us some metrics there. And then also on the foreign exchange side, we don't often see this order of magnitude negative impact for DuPont on ForEx and I gather a large part of that was Latin America. Can you talk about your pricing strategy down there? How much is in local currency? How much is in U.S. dollars? And how much do you anticipate this continuing into the fourth quarter?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes. So thanks, Frank, for the question. Now, on the TiO2 question, if you read through to what our customers in TiO2 are saying in their releases are -- especially the U.S., they talk about destocking is largely complete. They talk about normalizing inventory levels. So those comments are really drafting off of what our customers are saying in the industry, which is a gauge in terms of the whole value chain and where inventories are on. And I think a positive one for really going into next year in a season. You talk about the Brazilian real and Nick can comment on that.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes. So when you think about Ag and the pricing in the region in Latin America, you got local currency pretty much in Brazil around our corn supply. And when you think about Argentina, that would be done in the US dollar basis. And when you think about the currency change that has occurred in the quarter, for the real, we were at 1.63, third quarter last year, and it's at 2.03, third quarter this year. So you can see the significant change in the currency and that 20% difference really is part of that $0.13 currency impact I talked about. You didn't talk about -- ask about euro, but the euro is same sort of magnitude. You're talking about last year, it was 1.24, and this year it\u2019s 1.44. So the currency impact did have a significant impact of the overall EPS.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","For the newest restructuring effort announced this morning, can you help provide some context around geography, the geography component, for the calculus of trimming the workforce versus the business line? And I guess, in the broader context, you've been focused on productivity for several years, which, of course, has been beneficial, but at what point are there diminishing returns? I think in a previous question, you had answered about S&P. At what point are the diminishing returns as you see some end markets, such as housing, turning the corner?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question. The impact of the restructuring hit all regions of the world. So if you think about even the residual cost from DPC, that residual cost resides in every region of the world and we're not -- we don't size it by geography. We allow our businesses and functions to talk to their people locally, which is where those conversations should take place. So it is an overall type of thing. In the businesses, I would describe it more as surgical in terms of looking at their value change and making the necessary structural changes that they need, regardless of where it is in the world, to react to a changing environment. And so when you think about productivity, it is kind of a funny story. We learned a lot by doing the separation from DPC that allowed us to think about how we operate from a corporate core and infrastructure standpoint that really enabled us to take additional action at this time, and to really streamline our corporate functions and support for our businesses to be much more efficient and effective in getting the necessary work done. And from a business standpoint, as you know, businesses do -- product lines move businesses. Each one has their own particular cycle but some of these things are to create renewal or headroom for investments in new products and research & development in different areas. And so it's more of a renewal standpoint from them. And with the size and breadth of our product line, I think there's always going to be opportunities to do that, depending on our ability to innovate and really replace ourselves right out in that marketplace. So it is about getting back to focusing on creating momentum, streamlining the headquarters and the corporate staff and really allowing the businesses to respond very agilely in a very uncertain environment.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","2 things. First, when I look at infrastructure investment in China, it looks like it rose in September. It's been positive all year. Residential has been flat since April. So can you help us understand what specific end markets you're feeling the pressure in? And then second, just a quick question, of the 1,500 people, how many of them are outside of DPC?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes. So the 1,500 people are not in DPC. So DPC, we are in the process of standing that up as we separate. These 1,500 people are either in as part of the residual cost or part of the other actions that we are taking from the business or functional standpoint. As far as China goes, it's always interesting to try to get underneath those numbers. But if you think about housing, commercial construction and residential construction are not providing any lift from a China standpoint. And if you take an example, like if you think about fluoropolymer, that goes into wire cable. And that's basic to a lot. But it's not showing any progress. And so it impacts a lot of different industrial, transportation and construction type of markets. I mean the bright spot we see in Chinese is automotive and Nutrition & Health and Agriculture. And those are the 3 areas that we continue to see movement in. But on the industrial side or the construction side, we don't see any meaningful activity.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Morsella [ph] from RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Analyst","Just thinking about 2013, given your long-term guidance for 7% sales growth, then 12% EPS growth, and given that 2012 may set a lower base than previously expected, can you maybe frame your early outlook in 2013 in this context?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes. So, let me talk about '13 for a minute. I think that, that might be helpful. So if you talk to our economists, they're projecting it to be -- GDP to be a little lower at '13 than it is this year. Western Europe, 0. Asia growth, everybody pegs it comparable to '12, but I think it's very different depending on sector. North American GDP, they're expecting to grow less than 2012 due to the many uncertainties that we see at least impacting the first half of the year, like the debt issues, fiscal cliffs and the election outcome. But if you take a look at the sectors where we participate, Ag\u2019s strong fundamentals, global stocks remain tight. Prices are good from a farm income standpoint but they're volatility. We've got excellent momentum from our 2012 product performance and the early orders that we're seeing now for a strong 2013 strong season. Planted acres are forecasted to be very good for Brazil Safrinha and North America and so we're very focused on really delivering for the growth that we see there. Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences continued margin expansion through cost synergies, delivering on the synergies from the acquisition. You saw the kind of margin expansion we saw. They got new products in the pipeline and innovation coming. And I think we'll see continued performance improvements there. If you take a look at Performance Materials, auto builds are forecast to be up maybe only 1%, 1.5% next year. So off its 5%, 5.5% base this year but growth. And our innovation centers are really helping us with penetration on these advanced polymers into that industry. So let's talk about things like Safety & Protection. The restructuring actions will take hold. We'll see savings in that segment next year that will help expand margins, in addition to U.S. housing improvement that will help bolster up them. In Electronic & Communications, I've already stated that a PV, we expect it to be flat year-over-year. And the improving part of that will continue to be the strength in smartphones, tablets and things. And PChem, as we said, we expect the performance chemicals, the TiO2 market, to bottom in the first half of '13, and that longer term, TiO2 demand will continue to correlate with GDP. So overall, there's a lot of positives and then there\u2019s some areas that we have to really focus on like TiO2 and really in getting PV to really work through some of their issues, as they are. And so '13 is going to be -- going to really be determined by the macroeconomic environment and what happens from the United States coming through the election with these issues. So I think we've got a lot of strength going with us forward and we're on top of the challenges we have to see where that will end.","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay, thanks, I think we're out of time.

This was another solid quarter across the board. Our results indicate our plan is working. We posted operating earnings per share of $1.24, a 14% increase from the prior year. Segment operating earnings increased 11%. Thanks to the disciplined execution, we also delivered improvements in several key metrics despite a difficult operating environment.","In fact, this was the second consecutive quarter of improvement in several of the metrics we watch most closely as indicators of fundamental long-term performance. Highlights include organic sales growth, gross margin increased, operating cost declined, operating margins expanded across all reportable segments, and free cash flow and working capital improved.","Let's start with sales. I am pleased about the improvement in our sales trend, given the challenging environment in which we are operating. Sales rose 1%, excluding currency and portfolio changes, with Agriculture and Nutrition & Health leading the improvement. Ag did better than expected in a very challenging market, and N&H grew despite the currency pressure. Volumes grew in half of our businesses and volumes grew in total by 2%.","We continue to drive cost savings across the company. Our operating costs on a year-over-year basis declined by about $220 million. I'll speak more about our progress in this regard in a moment. Another highlight was the margin expansion this quarter. Gross margin for the company increased over 100 basis points. We saw improvement across all of our reportable segments due to cost savings, mix enrichment from new products and technologies, and lower product costs. We delivered this performance in a difficult operating environment, as industrial production remains weak in North America, our largest market, and Ag markets remain challenging. We expect Ag commodity prices will remain at the low end of our planning range until demand accelerates, crop area declines, or there is some type of disruption in global production.","Given all of that, we feel good about our performance in the first half and the outlook we provided this morning. That outlook assumes 50% growth in operating earnings per share in the third quarter. We are focused on executing well and continuing to improve our cost profile, capital expenditures, and working capital. I'll provide detail on each of these.","First, we set a goal at the beginning of the year to deliver $1 billion in cost savings on a run rate basis by year-end. Our operating cost savings totaled about $135 million in the first quarter and $220 million in the second quarter. This is consistent with our cost savings commitments. One of the line items that we focus on is corporate costs, which declined 44% this quarter on an operating earnings basis. More important, a lean core allows us to accelerate decision-making, to stay closer to our customers, and to compete more effectively. We have eliminated the matrix organization, given business leaders more accountability for their overhead, and removed layers to become more productive and effective. The pace of action around here has definitely picked up.","Our second priority is more rigor around allocation of capital. After a thorough analysis, we invested about $150 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter, or about $500 million year-to-date. We remain on track for CapEx to be $1.1 billion for the year, versus $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours. Each of the projects we chose to fund this year are progressing as anticipated, giving us strong confidence in the returns we can expect.","The third priority is improving our working capital performance. It is a topic of discussion in every review Nick and I have with our businesses and in each weekly staff meeting. And we are seeing results. Year-to-date, our free cash flow improved by about $1 billion, and the working capital improvement was more than $200 million of that.","Another product of increased productivity and efficiency is freeing up capital to invest in R&D and growth. This is another priority for us. I'll give you a few examples. To meet growers' needs better, we are introducing higher-performing products like Zorvec fungicide and Leptra corn hybrids. We're increasing capacity in faster-growing areas like Tyvek building wrap and medical packaging. Our scientists today are utilizing the newest technologies like CRISPR-Cas gene editing to develop targeted applications to deliver enhanced solutions and greater choice for our customers. In fact, we introduced over 600 new products in the first half of 2016. These types of actions support growth for the long term.","Now, I'll give you an update on our merger progress. Just last week, the shareholders of DuPont and Dow voted overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction, providing further validation of the plan we are executing. The vote represents a key milestone toward the combination of our two companies, and the intended spin-offs into three industry-leading companies. In addition to shareholder approval, the other key condition for closing the merger is obtaining antitrust approvals. We are deep into the process of working with the regulators to secure approvals from countries where we do business. We continue to expect the close of the transaction later this year.","At the same time, we continue the planning that will enable us to hit the ground running immediately after closing. Together, Dow and DuPont have already identified synergies, division by division, to yield about 80% of our expected run rate savings. We have designed a top-level organizational structure, we have chosen the key metrics we will use for tracking synergy delivery, and we are ready to come out of the chute fast on realizing those synergies. We plan to report our progress to the board on a consistent basis, because delivering the synergies is an important contributor to the value creation with this transaction.","In sum, we delivered a strong first half of the year. While we expect macro challenges to continue in the second half, we are well-equipped to deliver based on our execution and progress to date. I see and appreciate the hard work of our employees and keeping us on track during this time of significant change. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our businesses while advancing plans to create sustainable shareholder value through our planned merger with Dow. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the second quarter on slide 3.","Operating earnings of $1.24 per share increased 14% versus prior year and grew 18% year-over-year when adjusted for currency. Continued strong execution on cost savings across all businesses, lower product costs and volume growth drove improvement in the quarter.","Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.1 billion reflected 2% volume growth due to increased demand in Agriculture, Performance Materials, and Nutrition & Health. Globally, volumes improved in all regions except for EMEA. Local price, currency and portfolio in aggregate negatively impacted sales by 3%, resulting in total sales declining 1% year-over-year.","Turning now to slide 4. The year-over-year improvement in segment results contributed $0.14 to the quarter despite a $0.05 headwind from currency. The businesses continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment, particularly on cost savings, which drove margin improvement in each of our reportable segments. A net decrease in corporate expenses and interest contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter.","Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44% lower than prior year as a result of our 2016 cost savings program. A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.04.","In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program using proceeds from the Chemours separation. We continue to see the full benefit of this program here. A higher tax rate reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter due to our geographical mix of earnings. An increase in net after tax exchange losses subtracted $0.06 per share in the quarter.","Now, let's turn to the second quarter operating earnings analysis on slide 5.","Segment operating earnings increased $166 million, with growth and margin expansion in each of the reportable segments. This improvement broadly reflected cost savings, lower product costs, and as Ed mentioned, volume growth in three of our segments. When adjusted for the impact of currency, segment operating earnings increased 16%.","Agricultural operating earnings increased $93 million year-over-year despite a $36 million negative impact of currency. Volume growth of 3% was driven by increased corn seed and insecticide demand, partially offset by lower soybean volumes. Operating margins in this segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter. Jim will speak to Ag performance in greater detail later.","Nutrition & Health results increased $30 million, which more than offset negative currency. Volume growth of 3% in the segment was led by demand in probiotics and specialty proteins. Operating margins in this segment improved about 350 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 12 consecutive quarters.","Performance Materials operating earnings increased $24 million. Volume growth of 4% was driven by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China and North America, as well as increased ethylene volumes due to a prior year unplanned outage. The price decline was driven by pressure for raw material pass-through and ethylene prices as average spot prices were down approximately 40% year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 180 basis points year-over-year.","Industrial Biosciences improved operating margins by 350 basis points in the quarter, primarily on cost savings. Protection Solutions and Electronics & Communications each improved operating margins on cost savings and lower product costs in the quarter. Further details on segment results can be found in the materials we posted on our website today.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 6. Negative free cash flow of $2 billion year-to-date reflects Agricultural's typical seasonal cash outflow in the first half. Our free cash flow improved about $1 billion year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to lower working capital, lower corporate expenses, and lower CapEx in the second quarter.","Working capital improved by more than $200 million in the quarter against tough economic conditions within Ag markets. Our capital expenditures decreased by about $200 million or 28% versus the prior year when you exclude Chemours. The absence of Chemours contributed $200 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow.","In regards to share repurchases, we now believe it is unlikely that we will complete all of the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by the end of 2016. The amount and timing of repurchases is dependent upon trading windows and daily trading volumes. We plan to enter the market as soon as our trading window opens, which is shortly after this earnings announcement.","On slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share from the low end of our previous range. The estimated negative currency impact for the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.15 per share. We continue to expect a benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, and a headwind from higher base tax rate in 2016 of about $0.10 per share.","Third quarter operating earnings per share are expected to be 50% higher than the prior year. As we noted in our first quarter call, the second half for Ag is expected to bring added pressure from economic conditions in Latin America and a route-to-market change in the southern part of the U.S. In addition, industrial demand in oil and gas markets remained challenging.","Excluding currency, we continue to expect sales to be about even with the prior year. Including currency, sales are expected to be down low-single-digits percent versus prior year. We would expect operating earnings per share growth of 19% to 21% when adjusted for currency, primarily driven by the full-year benefit of cost savings.","Now, let's turn to slide 8, our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, which is expected to deliver $1 billion in savings on a run rate basis by year-end 2016. This translates to approximately $730 million of net savings in 2016 versus the prior year. In the second quarter, our operating costs, which include SG&A, R&D, and other operating charges, declined about $220 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 12% decline in cost year-over-year.","On an operating earnings basis, SG&A costs declined about $160 million or 13%, primarily related to the G&A costs. Our corporate costs decreased 44%. The actions we outlined in December 2015 continue to generate results, and we remain on track to deliver a $200 million decrease in corporate expenses in 2016, improving to about 1.3% of sales. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide us an overview of the results for agriculture. Jim?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Thanks, Nick. Today, I'll take you through our view on market conditions, our financial performance and update you on our three priorities for Ag.","Agriculture markets continue to face challenges. As farmers endure tough economic conditions, seed and crop protection suppliers have elevated inventories and credit remains tight. We recognized that the Ag market was entering a challenging period back in 2014, and at that time, began taking actions to enable us to maintain our competitiveness. Fast forward 24 months, and our strong results in the first half of the year demonstrate the benefits of those disciplined actions. And because Ag is a seasonal business, I'll focus my comments on the first half performance.","Our sales in the first half were 2% lower, as higher prices and corn volume gains more than offset by currency, lower soybean, and crop protection volume and portfolio changes.","In seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price globally, which was led by North America. Additionally, we grew corn seed volume with uplift from Leptra, our newest technology, which has enabled a multiple point share gain in the competitive Brazilian","Safrinha market.","Also a positive for our Pioneer business was our continued penetration in the digital Ag space. Interest in our Encirca services remained high, as growers began to plan for the 2017 season. To date, our Encirca offerings were delivered on over 2 million acres, more than doubling last year's footprint.","Now, moving to our crop protection business, we were again able to fully offset the currency headwinds we faced in Brazil through increased local pricing, which helped to minimize the negative impact of lower volumes due to insect-resistant soy, weather conditions and higher inventories. From an earnings perspective for the first half, I was pleased that operating earnings for the segment increased 3%, driven by higher local price and product mix, lower product costs, and cost savings. Excluding currency, our operating earnings increased 9%.","Now as we move to the second half of the year, the focus turns to Latin America. In seeds, we expect growth in our corn business in Brazil, driven by the summer launch of our Leptra technology, offset by lower soybean volumes. Within our business, a portion of our sales will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, as we expand on our direct selling model in Brazil, which is a fine tuning of our route-to-market.","On the crop protection side, current market sentiment indicates stronger demand in the fourth quarter than in the third, driven by delayed purchasing decisions due to commodity prices and credit availability. Taking into consideration these dynamics, we expect sales to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter.","For earnings, we expect the third quarter to be down in the high 20% range as cost savings are more than offset by Leptra launch costs. When comparing our results in the quarter to the prior year, recall that last year we had two large earnings benefits totaling $48 million, associated with asset sales and an adjustment to product costs.","We can now anticipate sales for the full year to be comparable to last year, and operating earnings to rise by the high-single-digits percent, as increased local prices and cost savings are partially offset by currency. Excluding currency, we expect operating earnings to increase by low-teens percent.","Recall that full year results will also be impacted by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter 2016 seed sales into first quarter 2017. This shift is a result of enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business as we transition to an agency-based route-to-market in the southern United States, similar to the advantaged approach we have in the Midwest.","I will close with an update on the three priorities for Ag, namely delivering on our cost reduction and earnings plans, ensuring a solid return on investment for our innovation portfolio and working with diligence on the merger with Dow.","At the halfway point in the year, we are on track with our cost savings commitments and are delivering bottom line results that are ahead of our initial plan. The second half will present some challenges, but we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments. I continue to evaluate our innovation portfolio, and I am pleased with the strength of our pipeline, as evidenced by the favorable market reception to our best-in-class Zorvec fungicide and the fast ramp of Leptra technology in Brazil.","As mentioned, we expect Leptra to comprise more than 1\/3 of our product portfolio during the summer season and one of the fastest new product introductions in Pioneer history. These two successful new product introductions are evidence that despite the current challenging conditions, farmers continue to recognize the value of our technology.","But finally, we continue to advance our plans for successful integration of two healthy, innovative and highly complementary Ag companies. We are committed to delivering the $1.3 billion of cost synergies, and we expect the complementary combination of our respective R&D organizations to lead to a combined innovation growth above and beyond our respective current strong innovation pathways. We had a good start to what has been a very active year in agriculture, and we are excited about the progress that we're making. And I'm confident that the team is focused on the right deliverables and will continue to execute in the second half.","Now, I'll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory R. Friedman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jim. We'll now open the line for questions. John, please provide instructions to enter the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. One, the goal of putting Dow and DuPont together right now is to gather cost synergies and then split the company into three pieces. Because that's the operating plan, is the probability of M&A activity in 2017 that significantly low?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's \u2013 Jeff, this is Ed. It's \u2013 any M&A activity will most likely be low. However, technically, we are allowed to buy and sell businesses during that timeframe. The chances of us I think doing it of anything of any size are pretty minimal.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Secondly, interest rates have really come down quite a lot. How does that affect the pension liabilities of DuPont or the combined DuPont\/Dow entity? And will it change your funding requirements over a multi-year period.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jeff. It's Nick. So, let's just talk magnitude, so you can get a sense of the impact it might have.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This last earnings cycle here, when it just came out, we talked about the re-measurement we had to do because of the restructuring that was completed. The interest rates dropped 73 basis points. The 73 basis point reduction had over $2 billion of impact on the unfunded pension liability. So, you can see its dramatic swings, and those swings obviously can go either way, up or down. As interest rates start to increase, you'll see those unfunded liabilities drop rather dramatically as well.","And everything I'm talking to you about is from an accounting standpoint, not necessarily from a cash funding standpoint and that would be handled through the Pension Protection Act, and that's done over a different smoothing of interest rates over a longer period of time with a MAP-21 process that's used there. So, it's not as dramatic an impact in any one year because of those interest rate changes, as you would see from an accounting standpoint.","We will obviously be looking at the funding, and we obviously fund the pension plan to whatever is required from us in any given year and that will be done obviously as we go forward with the merger and the spins as well.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A question on Ag. Just as you look in the second half, I recognize the credit issues that are down there, but you've got the new Leptra hybrids and the local corn prices in Brazil in particular are quite attractive, plus the FX rates are favorable to the farmer. So, is it really credit that has you most concerned? And as you switch to the agency model, will you have to be issuing more credit? Or how are you really thinking about the second half down there?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Yeah. This is Jim. We're looking at that market from a number of different angles. Credit is one area that we constantly take a look at. We feel like we're not seeing any kind of bad debt rates that are above anything that we would normally see. But we're constantly watching it. What's really happening is because of the lack of credit out there, growers are delaying a lot of their purchase decisions. And you sort of see that in our guidance for the second half.","As we talk about a much lighter third quarter and then a much stronger fourth quarter, it's part of that shift that's going on. We mentioned a little bit of the shift that we're seeing as a result of some fine-tuning of that route-to-market model, and we already have operations in Brazil that are connected to that more direct route. So, this is not a real big change for us. It's a subtle change; could be $0.01 or so.","And then, we had some business that was primarily in the third quarter in the past that really landed into the second quarter. About $0.03 of the total here was because of that. And that was mostly in Asia. We had insecticide volumes and corn volumes. So, you're right on momentum. We're going to carry some strong momentum with Leptra going forward. The summer launch has gone really well. Clearly, one of the largest ramp-ups in our Pioneer history down there. And a few of the comps actually will look pretty good, too, in the fourth quarter compared to last year, when you think about what happened to that insect control market. So, that explains how that sort of lines out.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And as just a follow-up, in the U.S., for next year, it looks like the crop people keep revising their yield forecasts higher. You referenced there's plenty of seed inventory around already. Did you \u2013 from a seed production perspective, did you sort of curtail your production plans for next year? So, do you think inventory of seed going into next year \u2013 if yields stay where they're expected to go, do you think the inventory situation is going to be better or worse in 2017?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","We already had a pretty aggressive inventory plan going into 2016. As we said before, we started making adjustments in our operating plan a year and a half or almost two years ago, seeing this real tough commodity price market coming at us and knowing that we had to get out ahead of that to manage inventory. So, yeah, we did take some adjustments as we went into this season, and we're taking a real hard look at that as we go forward.","You know that the crop that went in the ground and the seed production that we have in the ground looks really, really good right now. Yields look good. Market conditions look great. So, even though we dialed it back, we could still see a little upward pressure there on overall inventories.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Maybe continuing on with Jim, if I could. Jim, I was curious on plans for Intacta in South America. I know you've got a license in Brazil, but you're also moving forward with the Dermacor product. So, are those mutually exclusive or are they additive? And then, also, could you talk more about what led to some of your soybean volume decline?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Yeah. So, you're right. We just recently announced the Intacta license and the ability to introduce that product into the Brazilian market. The way I, first of all, look at it is I think about that technology opposite the discussions that we're having with Dow and the opportunity with Contesta. (34:02) Today, Intacta is commercialized. It's available to us. It allows us to practice in that technology.","And then, we remain excited about what that future looks like as well. So, we don't see those two technologies as competing. We see that, over time, there's an opportunity. It allows us to offer many more choices in the marketplace for our customers.","When you look at seed treatment, Dermacor, we see that as a complementary offering when we compare it and combine it with the Intacta and the rest of our varieties that we sell into that market.","So, on soybean share\/volumes, clearly, our volumes in Latin America were impacted by the lack of technology that we had available to us and this license helps us solve that. And in North America, we've been going through a pretty dramatic conversion of our base varieties. You'll recognize the T Series launch that we've talked a lot about. We're approaching now this season, about 80% of our lineup has been converted over to T Series. And we use the new breeding techniques, this advanced yield platform that we have with Pioneer.","So, it's just a conversion. We're excited about the momentum that we're carrying going forward. And now that we've got this full technology lineup, we'll see how things shape up 2017 and beyond.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And if I might ask on corn, you had a quite commendable result there. You actually got some pricing, which seems pretty impressive given what's happened in the commodity markets. So, now, we've got corn even lower. Do you worry you'll compromise the ability to get price going into next year? Is it possible, like, back in the pre-biotech days, you could actually have new hybrids come out without a price lift? Or how do you sort of size up the market in light of this even more crimped farmer income situation?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Yeah. Thanks for acknowledging the performance in the first half. You're right. A lot of that price came from mix, and it's a tribute to the new technology that we had out there in the marketplace, especially in corn, in North America that really led the way. So, when we think about pricing going forward, it clearly is a value equation. We price for value. We price for the genetic mix that we have out there.","When you look forward to 2017, it's a little early right now to really be speculating on what that market looks like. I think you're right. We've got a crop in the ground that looks really darn good, and it will put some downward pressure on corn commodity prices. And so when we think about our price launch here later this year, we take two or three factors into the equation.","First, the technology lineup we have. Second, the mix and the geographic lineup. And then, third, the economic conditions that our customers are facing, and we'll price accordingly to the value that we're delivering.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Jonas.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, actually, continue talking a bit about the soybeans in North America. I \u2013 your main competitor also reported reduced soybean volumes. And I guess what I'm wondering is, so if you guys didn't sell soybeans, they didn't sell soybeans, who sold the soybeans?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Well, again, it's a little early to speculate until we, kind of, see final yields and final data that comes in. This was a really competitive environment that was out there this year. And so, we're evaluating that. You think about the year-over-year acre numbers that we saw the USDA recently published USDA acres. I think you're seeing some of those volumes consistent with those acre numbers. So, overall, we'll see how it shakes out. But my view might also be that local, regional and some of the retail brands also had pretty strong performance this past year, so...","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And a follow-up, if you don't mind, on the crop protection side. So, in Q1, you had an 18% drop in crop protection due to the closure of La Porte. La Porte is still closed, as far as I know. So, where did all this volume come from?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Yes. So, as we look at the second half of the year, a couple of things going on with La Porte. Last year, we sold Lannate out of inventory that we had carried over after the site closed. So, we were really working off of inventory that we had.","When you then compare that to the second half of this year, we've essentially replaced our methanol volumes from \u2013 by sourcing from third parties. And then, overall, that market is down a little bit. So, the methanol year-over-year is actually about awash. Where the crop protection insect upside is coming from is really in Asia-Pacific.","We saw the lead edge of that here in second quarter with the early onset of the monsoon and some favorable markets there. And then, we continue to drive the volumes of Cyazypyr with those launches. And then, our new fungicide Zorvec was also launched in Asia-Pacific, and all of those things really add up to those volumes in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Ed, the success you've had in the cost savings year-to-date, did that increase your confidence in realizing the cost savings that the combined Dow\/DuPont are perhaps exceeding that $3 billion target?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, look, we're off to a very good start six months into it. In fact, we're very far through the billion-dollar cost reduction on a run rate basis that we talked about for us this year. So, yeah, we're feeling very good about it. I wouldn't say my confidence is higher because of what we did this year. My confidence in the $3 billion of synergies on the Dow\/DuPont merger are more because we now are digging line-by-line into all the detail. And as we mentioned earlier, we've identified 80% to 85% literally line-by-line of where the cost reductions are coming from to get us to at least the $3 billion.","So, we do have the teams shooting higher than $3 billion. I don't want to target that number yet and get that out there. I think it's a little bit early, but we are targeting higher than that. My personal opinion, having done this many times before, is that once the purchasing teams can really dig into the detail and they can't do everything yet because we're not merged and that's one area you're not allowed to overlap on any contracts. But when they're allowed, with a $37 billion spend between Dow and DuPont, I'm used to seeing numbers on savings that are more significant than the numbers that we have highlighted to you so far.","So, I'm viewing this $37 billion pot of opportunity as an area where we can get some upside to the plan. And it would be awful nice to get it there because that's not head count related, and we can really lock that in for a few years. So, I'm highly confident we're going to have at least the three.","As I highlighted, this will really, in my opinion, be one of the most important things that we will do with the MergeCo board, as it really is a big part of the value creation, at least, initially when we put these companies together. So, I'm feeling very bullish about it. And clearly, we will accomplish what we told you we'll do this year. Remember, the $730 million on a net basis we're going to save this year, I think you can see is lining up very nicely.","I would highlight to you that our comp in the third quarter on the savings is tougher because we had a reversal of our bonus variable pay last year because of the performance of the company last year that was fairly significant, and then we also had a decent restructuring in the third quarter last year which reduced our cost. So, when you net it out, you'll see that the comp gets a little bit harder. But still, we're going to be saving at a billion dollar run rate exiting the year to get you to $730 million that you'll actually see in the P&L numbers this year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. Ed, just one more thing. When you look at the potential combination, the ultimate three-way separation, any further thoughts on the optimal structure of the new companies? Is this three-company structure right now the best approach? Could it be four or five companies? Any further thoughts on the ultimate separation of Dow\/DuPont?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes \u2013 no, look, I would just say, David, that, look, obviously, this is the agreement that we came to think it's very good the way we have it structured. If Dow and DuPont and Andrew and I or any of us, we think there's something more optimal to do with the mix of businesses, we certainly can look at that in MergeCo., and that would require a 2\/3 vote of the MergeCo. board to make a change like that. But we'll always look at things if something could create better long-term value for shareholders. But the path we're all on is the path we're on and headed down right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Ed, I was wondering what your view is on this next stage of antitrust review. What country or regulatory agency are you most concerned about either requiring potentially the most concessions or maybe just the uncertainty and timing of it all that may drag it out? Where are you the most concerned?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, there's four large markets that really matter significantly here. China, Brazil, and I say countries but one's a region, the EU and the U.S. So, that's the four big regulatory ones. Dow and DuPont are already in deep conversation with all the relevant agencies in those jurisdictions. So, we're not beginning. We're getting deep into it.","You might have saw the other day. I think it came out that there might be some remedies. We always went into this saying we would be ready on remedies, if that were needed. So, we're hoping that that helps out the timeline. So, having said that, I'm not naive. This is a huge merger. Although we are going to split into three, but it is a huge merger and I'm sure it's going to get a thorough review. But looking at the timeline, I still think we're on a timeline by the end of the calendar year to accomplish this.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then, one for you, Jim. As you think about the impact of lower crop commodity prices on demand for crop chemicals, are you more concerned that it could just lead to less demand, more discretionary use of crop chemicals or a shift down in \u2013 to more generics? And do you think you can offset some of that with your approach to offering financing to growers and attracting both seed and chemical purchases at the same time?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Yeah. Steve, you're right, it's always a possibility in a difficult market like we're facing now and that we're heading into that as a grower prioritizes the spend. Clearly, the focus on seed and to get my equipment and my land rented. get all of my inputs and fertilizer paid for, that crop protection spend is usually the last dollar spent. So, we've got a lot of experience with that. At the same time, productivity is the name of the game. And even in a tough market like this, growers will invest in a crop to drive as many bushels off of those acres as they possibly can.","So, that's clearly a balance there. And we like the lineup of products that we have out there in the market and we price them right to deliver the right kind of value for that. And we're always looking for other ways to deliver those type of products, whether it's through seed treatment and other key routes. So, we've been here before. We know how to operate in these markets, and we've got a good team that's heavily focused on it. Eyes wide open, we're looking forward here to make sure that we're taking the steps right now today to continue to be competitive going into that 2017 market.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi, good morning. A question on R&D. In the first half, your R&D costs dropped by $125 million to $850 million. So, what do you think should be the run rate R&D expense for DuPont standalone and then maybe some comments on R&D synergies with DuPont\/Dow or Dow\/DuPont?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, the standalone \u2013 and probably, this has historically been the number on R&D for, gosh, the last ten years whether you look at it as a percentage of sales or just a dollar basis. Look, we're running it and sort of annualizing your number. We're running around $1.7 billion in total spend, and that feels about appropriate. The two years before that, it was just \u2013 as you've mentioned, it was slightly higher, but the run rate historically has been kind of running right around that on a percentage of sales basis very similar also.","But once we do the merge, our anticipation is there's very little of our cost cutting. It's only going to be where there's really overlap on identical things in the R&D area. We obviously want a hefty R&D. We especially want it in the Ag business. We want to be one of the top spenders, if not the top spender in R&D in Ag. But we'll move some of that around to some other new product areas that we can work on instead of duplicating some efforts with Dow. I think probably that will be just great for the farm community and our farmers and our customers, there'll be more choice for them over the ensuing years, if we get that right.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And on seed pricing, can you talk about pricing regionally? Maybe talk a little bit about U.S. versus Latin America. And how much of the FX impact in Latin America were you able to recover through pricing? Thank you.","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","So, on the seed side, as I mentioned earlier, a big part of our price increases came from mix and it was tied to the lineup of new genetics that we had out in the marketplace. The majority of our crop protection price increases were aggressive actions that we took specifically to offset the negative impacts of currency in Latin America. So, as I said earlier in the opening comments, this is the second quarter in a row where we've been able to fully offset the impact of the currency because we have it out there ahead of it.","And then, again, we talked about pricing before. Overall, we take a holistic look at price. Some of it is mix and technology. And a lot of it has to do with the value that that product delivers, and we differentially price our products in core markets almost down to the zip code level, so you see a lot of differences in the way we position.","The final aspect of price for us globally that has been very positive in Latin America has been the launch of our new technology with Leptra. We had a good view of it in the se premia (50:41) season. This ramp-up in the summer season is probably one of the largest ramp-ups in our history and where we're going to feel the benefits of that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and nice results.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","What are the chances that this is the last DuPont conference call in DuPont's current configuration?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","My gut is there's one more.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It'll be close, I think. Don't you think?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I hope.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. Hey, a bigger picture question, Ed. You mentioned early on that you were pleased with the performance of the company and the sales figure, although down 1%. It kind of caught me a little bit cold, I guess. But I understand that it is a difficult macro environment. You also mentioned that volumes were up in all regions except for Europe. Can you expand upon what are you seeing from a pace of business perspective around the world and what the expectation is?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Frank, one of the reasons I made the comment on sales \u2013 I sure hate to brag about a sales number that's around zero, but \u2013 and I'm not. We always want to strive to do better. But just to give a little backdrop, the reason it feels better is we were plus 1% organically. For the whole company, we were plus 2% on a volume basis. And the quarters before that, four or five quarters before that, organically, we were kind of running a negative 2%. So, we've seen a shift of about 3%, which is not insignificant. So, that's really, I think, the key change there.","But I think to the bigger backdrop of what you just said, I mean, the global economy is \u2013 industrial production globally is growing 1%, and that's even down a little bit from last year. GDP has been lower because of Brexit, maybe, with Europe, so that's kind of running around 2% to 2.5%. So, we're kind of not running out of line any differently than anyone else.","And probably, you were accurate on your points on a worldwide basis. Our volume was up in North America, it was up in Latin America, it was up in Asia and it was down some in Europe. So, again, that was an improvement from where we had been running also. We're not planning on this environment changing. We're planning our rest of 2016 and 2017 to be just kind of how the world is right now. And so, we'll make smart decisions. And if things do improve for us, all the better for us, but we're not going to plan that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Ed, what's the timetable for announcing the full board of Dow\/DuPont?","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it will be announced before the merger, for sure. I'm hoping not too far here down the road. We're pretty far along at both ends on who those candidates will be. We're just working on a couple still. And hopefully, not too far from now, we'll get it out.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then, you gave volume growth by region and you gave it by segment, but we don't get the matrix. The 1% volume growth in North America, at least directionally, could you parse that apart a little bit for us? I assume Performance Materials was up a lot against the outage a year ago. Was that largely offset by the Protection Solutions segment, given that oil and gas weakness and military would have largely been in the U.S.?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And when you look at it, in North America, we had volume up in Nutrition & Health: it was up about 3 percentage points. Performance Materials, as you said, was a big part of it because of the unplanned outage and the comp that was being looked at there.","And we also saw volume increases in Industrial Biosciences, about 3%. So, those are the ones that contributed very positively. And as you pointed out, Protection Solutions continues to be dealing with the rather depressed oil and gas segment, and that obviously is impacting some of their volumes.","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And military.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And military as well, yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question...","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And electronics also is one where we're seeing, on the consumer electronic side, probably I think as everyone else has been reporting for the last three to four months, softness on that end of the market. And we think that picks up slightly in the second half. Originally, we are planning a bigger lift, but we've kind of dialed that back a little, thinking we'll just see a slight lift as we go into the holiday season.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Dan DiCicco on for Arun. Thank you for taking my question. Just wondering if you guys could talk about your outlook for ethylene prices in the back half of the year. We've seen spot kind of come up recently. Do you guys think this is sustainable? And then, what happens kind of following the heavy maintenance season here as we have crackers restart and then some new capacity comes on?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","When you look at our ethylene play or our presence there, it's relatively small, right? We're about 2% of the total U.S. capacity. When you look at how our product is handled, about half of our ethylene is consumed internally. And then, of the other half, half of that is on a long-term contract and then that last 25% is sold in the external market. So, relatively small in the external market. More specifically around your question of where do we see some of that spot market going, we see the quarter three continued decline somewhere in the mid- to upper-teens from a percent basis and pretty flat from in quarter four.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, excluding autos, are you guys seeing any strength out of any particular end markets or regions that you guys would like to highlight? I know you mentioned some previously, but is there anything else you guys might be looking at?","James C. Collins - Executive Vice President-Agriculture","Well, I mean, we saw strength, as you mentioned, in Asia, but specifically in China is where we saw a tremendous amount of the strength as well as North America. Those would be the two key auto markets where we saw a lot of the volume increase being driven from.","Gregory R. Friedman - Vice President-Investor Relations","And we're up to our last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Ed, you've highlighted in the past the $1 billion opportunity in working capital, but noted that this would take more time to achieve than other productivity initiatives. Could you provide an update on where the company currently stands relative to your longer-term working capital targets?","Gregory R. Friedman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Sandy, we just launched that program just about a quarter \u2013 I guess the middle of the first quarter. We didn't start that with everything else we had going on for a few months. And I actually feel good about it, the traction we have. So, half way through the year, our free cash flow is about a billion dollars better year-over-year than last year. So, that was a nice improvement. But what was nice we got some initial traction out of the chute on working capital, about $200 million of that billion-dollar improvement in cash was from working capital. Almost all of the working capital improvement was on the inventory side and in the receivable side because of what Jim Collins talked about on Ag. My gut is it's just going to be harder to move the needle as quick, although we have programs. We're working on it.","But \u2013 so having said that, I think getting $200 million kind of almost one quarter into the program on our billion-dollar opportunity was pretty darn good. And again, over the intermediate period, I do think we're entitled to about $1 billion, maybe a little bit more of opportunity. But I will tell you, Nick and I, as I said in my prepared remarks, we talk about this in every operating review meeting with the presidents. We all have very detailed programs now. It's just like anything else, when you focus on it and spend time on it, you will get it fixed. So it was nice to see the initial traction, you know, so far.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, a follow-up on the cost-saving opportunities in Ag. Beyond the $1 billion, I think there were some additional opportunities highlighted from the potential for the Ag business to migrate to an existing SAP platform rather than establishing a new platform. I was wondering if there were any updated thoughts on this area. And if so, what type of upside potential do you see.","Edward D. Breen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We haven't scoped the full upside potential but it's down the road, and we're just not spending time on that. To give you the overview, we're waiting on a more integrated system until we get to the spin stage. What we've got to do in the interim is come up with a high level layer that makes all the systems talk to each other.","Jim Collins and the team are going to make sure obviously that's happening in Ag, that will happen in the specialty company. Dow will obviously stay with their SAP system and layer on our Performance Materials business onto that fairly easily. But what we will then do when we get closer to spin is really start to work \u2013 actually, DuPont had spent a lot of time on the latest SAP system and start an integration process then. And that's where we will get G&A savings when we get to that point. But that is clearly going to wait until we get through the synergy work with MergeCo and then we'll launch into that.","Gregory R. Friedman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you for joining the call today, and we very much appreciate your interest in DuPont.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn the call over to Greg Friedman. You may begin.","Gregory R. Friedman","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining our discussion of DuPont's fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance.","Here with me are Ed Breen, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Collins, Executive Vice President, responsible for our Agriculture segment.","The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our Web site, along with our news release. During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements. I direct you to slides 1 and 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.","Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides, which are posted on our Web site.","Our agenda today will start with Ed providing his perspective on the company\u2019s performance and the advancement of our strategic initiatives. Then, Nick will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and 2017 guidance. Third, Jim will discuss our Agriculture business. We will then take your questions.","With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to talk about the important progress we made on our strategic priorities in 2016 and explain why that sets us up so well for '17 and beyond.","As you know, heading into 2016, we targeted certain fundamental metrics that we believe are the right measures of our performance going forward. Thanks to a lot of hard work throughout DuPont, we improved on all of them.","Companywide gross margins improved by 60 basis points. Operating costs declined 11% including a 41% decline in the corporate costs. Operating earnings per share grew 21%. Segment operating margins improved by about 200 basis points with increases in all reportable segments. Capital spending declined 27% and free cash flow improved by $1.6 billion.","These improvements were enabled by our leader more accountable organizational structure. We also strengthened our business by improving our focus on the customer and better meeting their needs.","For example, in our seeds business, we moved the southern U.S. and parts of Brazil to an agency sales model. Timing of seed deliveries primarily related to the southern U.S. route to market change pushed about 200 million in sales into 2017. That was clearly the right thing to do. The enhancements to our route to marketed ag have improved customer relationships and strengthened our competitive position.","We introduced nearly 1,600 new products into the marketplace this year. A good example is our electric corn hybrid. We introduced these seeds in Brazil and in one year they accounted for more than half of our corn sales in the country. Another example is our new lineup of bioactive products serving industries that range from food and grain processing to household products.","In addition, we developed new applications of existing products, like leveraging Tyvek for a roofing application which provides moisture protection and installer safety. By continuing to invest in R&D and product development, we aim to turn volume gains like those we had throughout most of this year into sustainable top-line growth.","In addition to strengthen our position in the marketplace, we delivered solid results against our strategic priorities, which have made DuPont stronger, more focused, more effective and efficient. The first strategic priority was delivering 730 million in year-over-year cost savings and we surpassed our goal for 2016 by $20 million. We did it without disrupting our businesses.","The second priority was disciplined and productive capital spending. For the year, our CapEx totaled $1 billion, down 375 million or 27% excluding Chemours. Capital spending now is back in line with depreciation and amortization and we intend to keep it that way. At the same time, we are fully funding compelling growth projects with solid returns. An example is the 100 million plus we approved last year for probiotics production facility expansions in New York and Wisconsin.","The third priority was working capital performance. We set a goal to improve our working capital by $1 billion over the medium term. Our free cash flow this year rose by $1.6 billion. Within that total, business working capital contributed nearly 500 million of the improvement and we will continue to build on this success.","We will continue to focus on productivity as well, including our production facilities. Plant efficiency and productivity can unlock significant shareholder value, as I mentioned during the last earnings call. This past fall, Nick and I visited a host of plant sites around the world and what we saw confirmed what we suspected. We have a terrific opportunity to improve throughput rates and our uptime performance to best-in-class levels. These improvements will benefit our customers, our margins and our returns on capital. It won\u2019t happen overnight as it can take two to three years to implement changes like this and see the benefits.","And finally, I\u2019ll close with an update on our planned merger with Dow. While our interactions with regulators and any discussions of proposed remedies must remain confidential, I can tell you that we continue to work constructively with authorities and all relevant jurisdictions to secure the necessary approvals to close the merger, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2017. We are very excited about what this merger will mean for shareholders, for employees and for all our stakeholders.","With that, now let me turn it over to Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you, Ed. Good day, everyone. Beginning with Slide 3, we delivered fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.51 per share versus $0.27 per share in the prior year. For the full year, operating earnings totaled $3.35 per share, an increase of 21% from the prior year. Results for the quarter and the full year reflected disciplined focus on cost savings against a challenging macro environment.","Consolidated net sales for the quarter of 5.2 billion were down 2% versus prior year. Local price declined by 2% while currency benefitted sales by 1%. Volume declined 1% as growth in Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications and Industrial Biosciences was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, primarily due to the southern U.S. route to market change.","Excluding the timing change in ag, consolidated net sales would have increased 2%. For the full year, sales of 24.6 billion decreased 2%. Local price and currency each lowered sales by 1%. From a regional perspective, we saw organic growth in developing markets in both the quarter and the full year, driven primarily by increased demand in Asia-Pacific. Sales in developing markets represented 34% of total company sales.","Turning now to Slide 4. Segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in fourth quarter operating earnings, contributing $0.14 to the quarter, including a $0.04 benefit from currency. Continued execution on cost savings as well as improved demand in most of our segments drove the growth in segment operating earnings.","Lower net corporate and interest expenses added $0.06 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis declined 45% in the quarter versus prior year, as a result of our 2016 cost savings program.","Exchange gains and losses contributed $0.05 per share to the quarter\u2019s results. The benefit is primarily due to the absence of a currency devaluation in Argentina in 2015, which negatively impacted prior year results. A higher tax rate lowered operating EPS by $0.01 in the quarter due to the geographic mix of our earnings.","Now let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on Slide 5. Segment operating earnings increased $150 million or 27% in the quarter versus last year with operating margin expansion of 305 basis points.","Nutrition & Health results increased $50 million. Growth in sweeteners and probiotics was offset by declines in protein solutions resulting in volumes flat versus prior year. Cost savings and a $27 million gain on the sale of an asset drove the operating earnings improvement year-over-year. Operating margins in this segment improved 615 basis points.","Performance Materials operating earnings increased $47 million. Volume growth continued in the quarter with a 7% increase, driven by demand in global automotive markets. Operating margins in the segment expanded by 275 basis points year-over-year.","Electronics & Communications operating earnings increased $11 million. This segment saw a 6% volume gain in the quarter due to increased demand in Solamet paste. New product introductions resulted in share gains in Solamet year-over-year. Operating margins improved by 115 basis points in the quarter.","Protection Solutions and Industrial Biosciences each experienced declines in operating earnings in the quarter. Jim will speak to Agriculture performance later and I direct you to the materials we posted on the Web site today for further details on segment results.","While not depicted on this slide, I would also like to highlight that for the full year segment operating earnings increased 9% resulting in operating margin expansion of about 200 basis points with growth in each of our reportable segments.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Free cash flow improved about $1.6 billion year-over-year with about 1 billion of the improvement coming from higher cash flow from operations and 600 million from lower CapEx.","Of the 1 billion improvement in cash flow from operations, more than half was attributable to higher earnings. The remainder of the increase was due to lower tax payments and improvements in business working capital, partially offset by payments under the 2016 restructuring plan.","The businesses continued to drive to best-in-class in working capital with an overall reduction of about $500 million in the year. Excluding Chemours, our capital expenditures decreased by 375 million or 27% versus the prior year. We ended the year at $1 billion in CapEx in line with our guidance.","In total, the absence of Chemours contributed $400 million of the overall improvement in free cash flow. We ended 2016 with net debt of 2.6 billion, flat versus prior year. Year-end cash balances totaled about $6 billion.","For the year, we completed 916 million in share repurchases under the 2016 program. We retired about 13 million shares at an average price of $69.61. Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were about 877 million and about 872 million for the fourth quarter.","On Slide 7, for the full year we delivered 750 million in operating cost reductions, exceeding our commitment of 730 million under the 2016 plan. Operating costs declined 11% year-over-year on an operating earnings basis.","SG&A costs declined about 540 million or 12% with most of the decline related to G&A costs. Our corporate costs decreased about $230 million or 41% for the year. Corporate costs as a percent of sales declined to 1.4% versus 2.3% in the prior year.","Turning now to Slide 8. I\u2019d like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2017. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and is expected to be a headwind for us again in 2017.","For the first quarter, the impact of currency will be about $0.01 headwind given the stronger dollar versus the euro in most emerging market currencies be offset by weaknesses versus the Brazilian real.","We expect global growth of 2.7% and global industrial production to increase 2.4% in 2017. The U.S. is expected to improve versus prior year but we remain cautious amid economic uncertainty and the stronger dollar.","Europe\u2019s growth outlook continues to be weak with economic and political uncertainty. China\u2019s slowing continues from the shift of industrial production to services and consumer segments. According to the HIS, global auto growth is expected to slow in 2017 with 1% growth year-over-year. Jim will speak to our assumptions for 2017 in the ag market.","With this backdrop, let\u2019s turn now to Slide 9. As Ed said, we expect the merger to close in the first half of 2017 pending regulatory approval. Accordingly, we are providing guidance only for the first quarter of the year.","We expect first quarter sales to be about even with prior year and operating earnings to increase about 8% versus prior year driven by benefits from cost savings and the impact of the change in timing for seed deliveries primarily related to the southern U.S. route to market change in agriculture. These benefits are anticipated to be partially offset by the expected reduction in planted corn acres in the U.S.","We expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%, an increase from 2016 due to the geographic mix of earnings. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be line with annual depreciation and amortization.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results for agriculture. Jim?","James C. Collins","Thanks, Nick, and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll provide a review of our full year results, give an update on our performance this year opposite our three strategic priorities and share our expectations for the first quarter. Now throughout 2016, our ag business executed well in a tough environment and delivered results which were above the guidance that we provided.","Full year sales declined 3% driven by 2% lower currency and 1% lower volume. Now full year sales were negatively impacted by the timing of seed sales primarily related to the southern route to market change in the fourth quarter. If we exclude the change in timing of fourth quarter seed sales, our full year sales would have decreased by 1%.","Our year-over-year operating earnings rose 7% driven by lower costs, partially offset by lower volume and the negative impact of currency. Operating earnings margin expanded for the year by about 170 basis points.","Now moving to our performance on our strategic priorities of 2016 which were first to achieve our cost reductions and earnings commitments; second to deliver on our new product pipeline; and third, plan for the synergy delivery and ensure the readiness for the new ag business.","Now our results exceeded expectations in 2016 even in light of the route to market change, which has strengthened our business by extending our advantaged go-to-market strategy to the southern U.S. We also extended this winning strategy in the Brazilian market.","Now our strong results were enabled by advancements from our innovation pipeline. In North America corn, our newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance and products released in the last two years accounted for more than half of our volume. Led by the launch of Leptra, we grew volume nearly 70% in the Brazil summer season and enabled a multipoint share gain.","In soybeans, our T-series comprised greater than 80% of our lineup in North America and we launched our first varieties developed with the AYT 4.0, an advanced proprietary soybean breeding approach focused on increasing yield. Within crop protection, Rynaxypyr insecticide delivered sales growth in Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America and our Zorvec fungicide launch went better than plan.","Lastly, we finalized our integration plans this past year with recent activity focused primarily on ensuring that we deliver our commitment of $1.3 billion in post-merger cost synergies. We strongly believe that bringing our successful seed and crop protection businesses together as Dow-DuPont and becoming one activation will increase our ability to innovate, meet customer needs and deliver returns for our shareholders.","Now turning to the outlook for 2017, we expect the economic environment in the ag sector to remain challenging with commodity prices under pressure due to record yields and crop production. As farmers look to relative economics between crop alternatives, we expect them to favor soybeans over corn in North America which is generally less favorable to our overall earnings.","Our order book in North America is tracking with our expectations and is consistent with the projected planted acre shift to soybeans. In Crop Protection, we expect the industry decline to ease in 2017 but continue to be negatively impacted by high inventory levels, a strong dollar, and the continued penetration of insect-resistant soybeans.","This season we are expanding our launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and anticipate FeXapan, our over-the-top dicamba application, to be approved in time for spring planting. We expect continued Leptra penetration in Brazil as we continue one of the fastest ramp-ups in our history.","We are planning a limited commercial introduction of Pioneer brand Qrome products for the 2017 U.S. growing season. Now this will allow selected growers to begin to benefit from this new corn technology and will allow customers to see and understand the value of these elite new products in their local geographies. We are also expanding our A-series soybeans in North America which are the highest yielding line of soybeans in our history.","Within the digital ag program, growers received value from Encirca Services on more than 2 million paid acres in 2016 and we expect this to approximately double in 2017. Now our approach stands apart from competitors in that our nitrogen, fertility, and seeding solutions can deliver measurable profit gains for our customers enabling a premium value offering.","For example, in over 120 nitrogen service trials, Encirca beat the standard grower practice 74% of the time with an average yield increase of 6 bushels per acre using an average of 9 pounds less nitrogen per acre. In Crop Protection, we will launch Vessarya, expanding our portfolio of fungicides to Asian soybean rust, and will continue the highly successful launch of Zorvec.","Turning to the first quarter of 2017, we expect the ag segment sales to be up low-single digits percent over 2016 and operating earnings to be up in the mid-single digits percent range as favorable impacts from the shift and timing of seed deliveries and pricing are partially offset by the anticipated corn-to-soybean acreage shift in North America. Within Crop Protection, we anticipate expanded availability of our carbamate products, Vydate and Lannate, and earnings growth as volume increases and we complete the wind down of activities at our LaPorte facility.","As farm margins continue to tighten, the need for high yields becomes even more imperative and we are confident that our portfolio can address this need through our pipeline of new genetics, unique trait combinations and innovative crop protection solutions. In 2016, we executed on significant cost reductions which enabled DuPont Agriculture to perform well in current conditions and positions us to emerge stronger when markets improve.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Greg.","Gregory R. Friedman","Thanks, Jim. We\u2019ll now open the line for questions. John, please provide the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys.","Edward D. Breen","Good morning.","Jonas Oxgaard","That was a nice beat there. It\u2019s always good to start the year going strong.","Edward D. Breen","Thank you.","Jonas Oxgaard","So on the merger, as I know you\u2019re constrained with can and cannot say, but is it mainly ag that we\u2019re worried about? And if you don\u2019t mind in general terms on how do you address the concern on innovation that the European Commission has raised?","Edward D. Breen","Jonas, let me make a couple of comments on it that I think we can obviously say publically and there\u2019s many things we can\u2019t say publically with the negotiations we\u2019ve been in. But the main concern is in the Crop Protection area and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused on a remedy package. And the way to resolve the question on innovation is not just some product but also some R&D resources that go with the product and that\u2019s how you address that part of the concern.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Ed, with the merger now pushed back probably to Q2, has the ultimate three-way separation also been pushed back for maybe mid-'18 to maybe late 2018?","Edward D. Breen","Yes, David, the spins will happen within 18 months of the time we do the merge so that the 18 months won\u2019t change. We\u2019ve got a very detailed timeline between Dow and DuPont to achieve that. When we first came out, we said 18 to 24 months but we\u2019re highly confident we can pull it off within the 18-month window. And clearly we\u2019re doing actions now pre-merge that just continue to build that confidence because we have more time, especially around legal entity work and IT-type work which is the long poles in the tent.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson","Thank you very much. Over the last several quarters, you\u2019ve clearly done a solid job on both cutting costs as well as dramatically improving procurement. As you\u2019ve now had the opportunity to further drilldown into some of the opportunities, can you just offer some further perspective on any new or simply enhanced opportunities you\u2019ve encountered over the past year or so, and how that visibility could lead towards further improvements within the combined entity? Thank you.","Edward D. Breen","Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. I would say, look, we\u2019re always going to stay focused on cost efforts and being lean and mean, as I\u2019d like to say. And clearly we\u2019ll ramp those activities up with the merger with Dow and the $3 billion program which I\u2019ll say is the floor, not the ceiling on what we\u2019re working towards. So clearly there will be a lot of effort in that area that we\u2019re very focused on and continuing to line up our actions there. There\u2019s really two areas I\u2019m very interested in personally with the senior team that I think are our next big opportunities. One, I alluded to actually in our prepared remarks and on the last earnings call, it\u2019s the capacity release and reliability centric focus in our manufacturing footprint. We\u2019ve asked and are working with all our facilities to come up with their entitlement program and we\u2019re really focused on the big ones. And the big facilities happen to mostly fall into one of these specialty products company. But there are more big complex facilities, like where we make Tyvek for instance. And we\u2019re really convinced now that we have great upside opportunity in the hundreds of millions of dollars to have improvement there. So that\u2019s a big focus going forward. We just started focusing on that in the last four months or so. The other area that we\u2019ve really got a focus on I think we can gain good momentum is a shift in our R&D throughput. And the background to that I think is important. The percentage products that were replacement products was a higher mix in the portfolio in recent years and what I would call growth R&D projects. And we\u2019re shifting that mix to more growth projects with good returns behind them. That doesn\u2019t happen in one year and by the way, the production facility thing doesn\u2019t happen in one year either. But if we can continue to make a shift in that area over the next few years, we can affect the top line of the company organically and improve the gross margin line nicely, which we did this year. We had some good wins to get the gross margins up 60 basis points, but that\u2019s where the two big opportunities are past cost actions.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. It sounds like in your negotiations with the EU, the EU either wants you to spend more on R&D or divest more assets. To their requests or the way you see regulatory evolving, does that mean that you\u2019re 3 billion in cost savings is now reduced or altered? And in terms of the delay in the merger, is the delay related solely to the EU extra 10 days? In other words, as a base case the merger should close May 1st or is it more complicated than that and that date closer to June 30 is more reasonable?","Edward D. Breen","Yes, Jeff, just the first part of your question. We had hearings very recently with the European Union and we\u2019ve showed them just going back to your comment about sort of innovation and R&D spending. We are not reducing at all the scientists that work on discovery and new product development. The reason \u2013 one of the key reasons obviously we like the merger here is to create an ag company that has more R&D resources for new product development. So where we would make some reductions in areas like regulatory approval type stuff where you don\u2019t need two of that and the footprint which is very local around the whole globe in the ag business. So we\u2019ve been through that in a lot of detail. We did ask for a 10-day extension because we\u2019ve been in detailed negotiations. It\u2019s a lot of paperwork that needs to get done. And we\u2019re just letting you know that yes, it could be just 10 days into March 14th but we still got to wrap up all the other jurisdictions and some of them tend to wait until you get a couple of the big ones out of the way. So by the time that follows on and you get that all finished up, my gut is we\u2019re in the second quarter and that\u2019s why we guided where we did.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim, could you give a little bit more detail on the seed order book and maybe just what you\u2019re seeing out in the marketplace from a competitive perspective around pricing in both corn and soybeans versus your expectations and remind us what your price card look like coming into this year in your performance against that? Thanks.","James C. Collins","Yes, great. Thanks for the question. Taking a look at the order book, it would show consistent with what we\u2019re seeing out of USDA around a shift in corn acres to soybean acres. So we\u2019re feeling that shift as we start out the year. Our soybean business and soybean acres are also up consistent with that shift and I think we\u2019re probably even up slightly there as a result of some \u2013 what I think was pretty impressive product performance that we saw last fall at harvest. So as we\u2019re picking a little of that up, unfortunately we\u2019ll see a little bit of a timing issue there. We\u2019ll tend to see more of our revenue and earnings from the soybean business land in the second quarter. It\u2019s just kind of the timing the way soybean shipments occur versus corn. So overall if we think about pricing in especially North America corn card prices as we\u2019ve talked about before are about flat. Our route to market gives us good visibility of that pricing. We ought to get some benefit from a stronger mix as we continue to rotate out hybrids and we\u2019ve talked about in the last year as much as 50% of our lineup was being replaced by newer genetics. That number will continue to grow now as we\u2019ve got good traction on that. And overall if I step away from this \u2013 before I leave North America, it\u2019s still going to be a competitive market and we know that we got to be ready to respond if necessary. If I back away from just North America and I think about pricing just overall globally, I\u2019d say overall generally favorable. We\u2019re going to pick up mixed benefit from Leptra, continued penetration in Brazil. We had 70% growth in our business in Brazil last year and a big chunk of that was Leptra. So the mix effect of more of that genetics coming into the portfolio. And then we\u2019ll be launching Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, so we ought to feel some benefits there. I mentioned corn genetics and even though a little bit attributed to that route to market change as we get better visibility of what\u2019s going on in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","Good morning. The ag business is seasonally low in the U.S. in the December quarter. So was the minus 4% volume you posted for the U.S. and Canadian region, was that roughly flat to slightly negative for the non-ag business, again, given ag is probably seasonally low?","James C. Collins","Yes, you\u2019re right. If you look at that fourth quarter volume response, it is related to our seed business. It\u2019s that route to market change and some of the seasonal delivery timing. Globally that performance also still related to our soybean performance in Brazil, we continue to struggle there. We\u2019re looking forward to having the Intacta offering going forward, but especially this last quarter Intacta affected Crop Protection volumes as well a little bit there. But if I compare fourth quarter volumes in the seed business versus crop protection, you\u2019re right. Crop Protection would have been up year-over-year in the fourth quarter; had a pretty strong run and most of that was North America and Asia. Good performance in insecticides in Asia Pacific.","Edward D. Breen","And maybe just to add on to that, because you asked about the rest of DuPont. Without that route to market change in the fourth quarter, DuPont organically would have been up 2% on sales. So the other segments were \u2013 I won\u2019t go through each one but they were either kind of flat to up some on the organic, but it would have put us on a positive. So that shift is what did that in the fourth quarter. Let me just address \u2013 Jeff, I apologize. You asked a few-part question there and I think it\u2019s important to highlight that we\u2019re still very committed to the $3 billion in cost savings being the floor. We\u2019ve also taken into account that we\u2019re going to be remedies. We always took into account the remedies would probably be in the area that I highlighted to you. So we\u2019re very confident in that number with the remedy package.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne","Yes. Thank you. We\u2019re hearing concerns out of the channel about the restrictions on this label that Monsanto\u2019s dicamba formulation has with respect to wind speed and rain and buffer and so forth, question would be is your \u2013 are you expecting something similar for FeXapan or could it be something more favorable? And how does all of this play into the opportunity for what might be an approval on the Enlist package that Dow is developing?","James C. Collins","Thanks, Steve. Clearly, we\u2019re watching that situation as well. We\u2019ve collaborated as technology partner with Monsanto. We\u2019re in licensing those traits. We had good visibility of our product performance this past year. We think those buffers are appropriate given early days and new technology. We modeled our FeXapan product registration as an exact mirror image of Monsanto\u2019s registration, so very likely we\u2019ll have exactly the same buffer requirements downwind, buffer requirements that they do. And I\u2019d also say we\u2019re targeting customers that we work with that we know are great stewards of our products and we\u2019ll work with this on those stewardship requirements as well. So we\u2019re putting an extra layer of help and support out in the marketplace to answer questions and make sure we\u2019re ready to respond. But overall we\u2019re excited about the technology and it\u2019s a brand new tool that growers are going to have to control what\u2019s becoming a pretty tough issue out there with resistance management. As far as Enlist goes, I really can\u2019t comment on any of the specifics associated with that. You\u2019ll have to talk my Dow colleagues.","Operator","Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. Another question on ag. Back in '13 you had signed the deal with Monsanto around the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend licensing, some other things in that. Am I right that I understand because that was a paid up license, as you start to grow into Roundup Ready 2 Xtend this year, the profit on that should be extremely high because there\u2019s no incremental costs year-over-year in '17 versus '16 or '18 versus '17, but now the revenue starts to flow through? Can you just walk through the dynamics of how that license will play out from a profitability standpoint?","James C. Collins","Thanks. Under those agreements, DuPont Pioneer made a series of upfront payments and there were some variable-based royalty payments associated with that. So beginning in 2018, the paid up portion of that will essentially be complete and beginning in 2018, DuPont Pioneer will continue to pay some royalties on a per unit basis. The way that works is the royalties that we paid begin to be recorded as we start to sell the units going forward. So we have this essentially our expense \u2013 essentially a way to kind of flatten out the impact. So, no, you should see really no change in the net profitability of the business going forward as a result of those payments.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Can you please flush out the comments about emerging markets headwinds and maybe give some, maybe a force ranking of the headwinds that you\u2019re facing outside of the ag sector?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Laurence, this is Nick. When you look across the world; Brazil obviously is still in the recessionary sort of environment, so issues there and instability there, political instability as well. In India, you\u2019re looking at the demonetization move. Although we haven\u2019t seen significant impact from that move yet on our businesses, there is still the question of where that\u2019s going to lead to. In China, we continue to see \u2013 although signs of stabilization, you do still see the movement from the industrial into the service consumer side which has impact. The overall PD market and the impact that may have largely in the developing regions with the growth rate slowing there. Those are some of the concerns and reasons why we were somewhat cautious when we looked at developing markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Jim, a question on Crop Protection. Your release indicated that your sales were up 9% in the quarter. Just wondering what they were up to the year as a whole? And you made some rather cautious comments on the market outlook for Crop Protection in '17. Do you expect your sales to be up? And then finally if you can tell us how Rynaxypyr has been doing?","James C. Collins","Thanks, Don. You\u2019re right, our fourth quarter performance was up and as I said before that was related to some strengthening that we saw in North America as well as our insecticide performance in Asia-Pacific. Overall for the year, we were down mid-single digits for the full year and that\u2019s really reflecting the headwinds that we had early on in the year. As Nick mentioned, Brazil, the impact of Intacta on our Rynaxypyr sales and then just overall concerns about channel inventories down there. But as we talk about 2017 we really see kind of the industry decline easing and we have upsides on some new product launches. We\u2019ve got Vessarya out there starting in 2017. We\u2019ll pick up the good sales as we continue to launch Zorvec globally and Cyazypyr. We\u2019re still in the early stages of launching Cyazypyr. We have always talked about globally if we exclude Brazil, Rynaxypyr volumes have continued to look pretty strong for us for eight years now, seven years into the global launch of that we\u2019ve seen year-over-year. I think about '17 going forward, I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably going to be a return to overall global volume growth of Rynaxypyr, Brazil included. So we\u2019ll be back on that trend line for continued performance of that whole product portfolio.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning, gentlemen and congrats on the quarter, and to Nick a begrudging congrats.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thanks, Frank.","Edward D. Breen","One more to go.","Frank Mitsch","Yes, go Falcons. As I look at your capital expenditure spending, I think at the beginning of the year you were looking at 1.1 billion, which was materially down from the year prior. Obviously it came in at around 1 billion, so even lower. So I was wondering if you could talk about what sort of things that you forgo in terms of the spending? And how should we think about the breakdown between growth CapEx versus maintenance CapEx versus CapEx to \u2013 you spent a fair amount of time on the call talking about improving your manufacturing productivity. How should we think about DuPont in that vein in '17?","Edward D. Breen","Thanks for your question, Frank, and I\u2019m rooting for the Falcons also by the way just to get Nick a little heated up. But the CapEx in '17 will be very similar, up slightly probably about $1.1 billion is what we kind of targeted with all the businesses. We did this last year \u2013 we\u2019ve gone project by project through all of them and we\u2019ve really clicked there is where we\u2019re very \u2013 at least I\u2019m questionable on the returns we\u2019re going to get from the program. So we\u2019re spending money and very significantly where we know we\u2019re going to have really good returns. Probiotics is one we mentioned on the earnings call. We approved $100 million spend there in the next few years. It\u2019s going to significantly increase our capacity and throughput in that area and that business is going very significantly. We just announced the other week a major CapEx program at an experimental station here in Delaware. But when you look at the payback of it, it\u2019s very significant because it\u2019s a consolidation of a lot of desperate footprints and all that into a really high-tech environment for our employees. So we\u2019ll spend where we really know we have that capability. And I\u2019ll let Nick kind of give you a little bit on what I call the CapEx spend for maintenance versus growth and all that.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Frank, when you look at the line with what everything Ed just said and if you look going forward here, having our CapEx aligned with our D&A kind of yearly number is what one could anticipate. One of the other biggest drops is along the pre-commercial side, saw a decline there and the beta now being obviously in place was part of that. When you look at the maintain dollars, about 40% of our CapEx is in the run and maintain side. The rest would be on the grow and improve side of the house.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Edward D. Breen","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","If the border adjustment tax goes through the new administration, how do you think that impacts DuPont overall?","Edward D. Breen","Well that\u2019s yet to be determined but there\u2019s a couple of elements of it that if they tag along would obviously be beneficial to DuPont. If we get the repatriation piece of that coming along with it, that would have very favorable impact. I think you\u2019re aware, P.J., that the biggest part of our cash on the balance sheet is outside of the U.S. And so that would have favorable impact on liberating additional dollars to be spent whether it be on CapEx, M&A or returning value to the shareholders through share buybacks or dividends. When you look strictly on the border of the exports, imports, I think it\u2019s going to be slightly favorable for us from an exports side versus the imports side but obviously we have to wait and see the details around that as it becomes more solidified if it actually goes through.","Operator","Our next question is from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thank you. Could you provide some idea of free cash flow bridge for 2017 and maybe the biggest items, restructuring costs, CapEx, taxes, working capital, et cetera?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes. When you look at our free cash flow numbers and you see the large improvement we had of the $1.6 billion, a piece of that is the Chemours is no longer being a part of the numbers. That\u2019s about 400 million of the 1.6. So now you\u2019re at a $1.2 billion improvement in free cash flow. We saw the reduction in CapEx that we just mentioned. That\u2019s about roughly $400 million reduction in CapEx. We saw an improvement in working capital. If you look at the business working capital numbers, we had an improvement of about $500 million largely seen in inventory as well as accounts payable. Accounts receivable was flat to slightly up from a working capital standpoint. Those were the major improvements as you look at the working free cash flow.","Edward D. Breen","In 2017 I think you touched on that also. As I mentioned, CapEx will be about equal to depreciation, amortization but I got to plan in that 1.1 area, so kind of similar to this year and I would expect improvement next year in business working capital was a 500 improvement and we know we have at least $1 billion opportunity there as we\u2019ve mentioned before. So with the programs in place and the focus we have, we should see continued improvement there through '17.","Operator","Our next question is from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson.","James Sheehan","Good morning. Can you talk about any areas of your Crop Protection portfolio that you will consider nonstrategic post-merger? And regarding any of those, would you expect to possible divest something prior to the close of the merger? Thank you.","Edward D. Breen","Well, let me answer the second part. The first part I think we\u2019ve got to stay away from just because of confidentiality of our conversations. But what we would do is with a remedy package we would have obviously very quickly be talking to other companies that could purchase that package and try to have that all keyed up very quickly. And the issue \u2013 we know who the companies are. A handful or two of companies that would be very interested and we would move very quickly on accomplishing that.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Nils Wallin","Good morning. This is Nils Wallin sitting in for Mark. A question on auto builds. You have mentioned the IHS outlook but I was curious what DuPont\u2019s view was on auto builds for 2017? And overall what\u2019s your sensitivity to a 1% increase or decrease in auto production?","Edward D. Breen","So our numbers are in line with the IHS numbers. We\u2019re also estimating the 1% sort of number. And when you look at the sensitivity piece of that, about a third of our sales within the DPM business are related to the automotive industry. In '16, if you look at the results versus IHS we were pretty much in line or slightly above what their numbers were saying. So as we look at '17, we use those same projections.","Operator","Our next question is from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you. Good morning. You touched on this a bit but given that your soy portfolio has become increasingly competitive, would the earnings headwind from a shift to soy acreage from corn be less pronounced than in prior years? And then how much volume growth do you see for Leptra in 2017 and what kind of tailwind should we expect to see from lower seed production costs given decreased use of winter nurseries?","James C. Collins","So you\u2019re right. We will see some of those shifts going into 2017. If I think about Leptra for a moment, we saw 70% growth in that market and a majority of that growth was attributed to Leptra. You\u2019re exactly right as well as we look forward, the use of winter nurseries, we\u2019ve now gotten a good beat on our ability to produce what we need for that market. So you\u2019ll remember in that spring season prior to that, we sold out completely. We essentially sold everything we had for summer but we\u2019ve now got nice supplies coming in for 2017. So we\u2019ll benefit. It\u2019s still a little early to call. It\u2019s still a long way to go for that summer season at the end of 2017 just how big that penetration is going to be. And then I mentioned earlier in soybeans, we\u2019ve seen some nice improvements in our portfolio as we looked at product performance trials at the end of 2016 and some performance that we had out in the field as our T-series continues to penetrate, and we\u2019ll pick up I believe some share in soybeans as we go into next year\u2019s market as well as acres come back. And that A-series launch for us will be really critical there.","Edward D. Breen","Last question.","Operator","Our final question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Berney","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I apologize. He had to hop to another call. Just another quick question around the cash flow. You\u2019ve been pretty upfront around the D&A levels keeping the CapEx near there and it also seems that Dow is coming towards the later innings of its spending cycle. Have you had any conversations with them around how you view cash flow priorities kind of ahead and then after the merger and maybe rank ordering those?","Edward D. Breen","No, that\u2019s still something that would be separate between the two companies. But I think you can look at the track record of both companies in that regard. You can see what Dow\u2019s track record has been around dividend issuances and DuPont\u2019s track record of 435 consecutive dividends or in that range. You can see what we\u2019ve done around share buybacks independently this year and those are pretty much aligned as well. So I think the message would be that the actions we\u2019ve taken would indicate the path forward, but we haven\u2019t had any discussions around aligned agreements in that regard.","Gregory R. Friedman","This now concludes our call. We thank you for joining us today and we thank you for your interest in DuPont.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lori Koch please go ahead.","Lori Koch","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for DuPont's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont website and through the link to our webcast.","Joining me on the call today are Marc Doyle, Chief Executive Officer; Jean Desmond, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Breen Executive Chair. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slide. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty. Our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.","Our third quarter Form 10-Q as updated by our current and periodic reports include detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Doyle","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I'll quickly run through an overview of 2019 and how we executed against our key priorities, I'll then cover our priorities and expectations for 2020, including the actions we are taking in light of our expectations for a slow start to 2020 given further price pressure in our nylon business and unplanned outages, which have already been resolved at our largest S&C site. Our teams are intently focused on addressing these items to return to a more normal growth pattern after Q1.","Starting on Slide 2, the team delivered sound full year results within a macro environment dominated by the China tariff situation, which significantly challenged two of our key end markets, auto and electronics, resulting in both demand contraction and inventory destocking. As we navigated the market uncertainty, our team continued to stay focused on the levers within our control, including price discipline, and cost actions nicely mitigating the impact of volume declines on earnings. Our full year net sales of $21.5 billion were down 5% in total and down 2% organically with price up 2% and volume down 4%, while full year operating EBITDA of $5.6 billion was down 4%. Our strong operating discipline, resulted in gross margin expansion of greater than 50 basis points and operating EBITDA margin expansion of 10 basis points for the year.","Adjusted EPS of $3.80 per share was down 7% reflecting lower segment income, currency headwinds and a higher tax rate. This was partially offset by lower depreciation and a lower share count, due to both share repurchases completed in the first half of the year from the DowDuPont program and $750 million of repurchases we made since our separation on June 1.","Slide 3 provides more detail on our top-line results for the year. Both the pluses and minuses. Our performance in each of our underlying businesses was consistent with market trends and this slide highlights the themes we have talked about throughout the year, including our strength in 5G, which is reflected in our Interconnect Solutions business, the continued momentum in Water Solutions and the steady growth of our Food & Beverage business. We continue to make high return investments in R&D, CapEx and M&A in these and other areas to drive further innovation led growth including opportunities to expand our content in next generation smartphones and hybrid and electric vehicles. Offsetting these were lower results in our Semiconductor Technologies business and our T&I segment and lower sales in our Health & Biosciences business, primarily from pronounced slowdowns in North America, bioethanol and probiotics markets.","Moving to adjusted EPS results on Slide 4, within our segment results pricing gains synergies and cost savings were more than offset by the impact of softer volumes, lower equity affiliate income and higher year-over-year planned maintenance costs particularly in the back half of the year in S&C. Currency was a $0.16 headwind for the year. Below the line items had a net neutral impact to our adjusted EPS driven by an increase in the tax rate, offset by benefits from lower depreciation and amortization and a lower share count. I'll now cover how we executed against our 2019 priorities on Slide 5.","As I've mentioned, the past year was a challenge given macro conditions negatively impacting about 40% of our portfolio, which led to weaker results versus our expectations going into the year. However, we did deliver strong results in key end markets. Such as water, 5G, aerospace, medical, plant-based meats where the market fundamentals remain sound. Our continued commitment to a best in class cost structure was a key driver of our ability to expand both gross and operating EBITDA margins, we delivered greater than $500 million in annual savings from synergy programs and the restructuring program we launched in the second quarter of 2019. These initiatives did help to improve our operating leverage, but we still have more work to do here.","We also made significant progress this past year on our portfolio strategy announcing our agreement to merge our Nutrition & Biosciences business with IFF creating the de facto leader in the food and beverage space with the broadest technology and product offerings. Ed will speak further about this transaction later in the call. Additionally, we further refined our portfolio through the announcement of the divestment of three businesses during the year. ","Free cash flow conversion was strong this year and we reported greater than 100% conversion on an underlying basis for the past two quarters. Finally, while I'm pleased that our 2019 ROIC of 29% reflects a marked improvement from 2017 when the portfolio was first put together our 2019 performance was not as strong as our prior year results due to weakened working capital performance, lower segment earnings and a higher tax rate. Both working capital and segment earnings are key focus areas for improvement moving forward and critical components of our 2020 priorities, which I'll discuss on the next slide.","As noted, we know we have more work to do in some of our key value creation drivers. I am disappointed with our operational leverage as we exited the year and the slow start to 2020 and I'll provide more detail on the actions we're taking to return to growth, which is more in line with our expectations in a moment. ","Growth through innovation is a key component of our strategy and we will continue to drive competitive advantage and sustainable top-line expansion through our application development engine and deep customer relationships. Through our differentiated investment we aim to increase demand by advancing several key technical milestones in our major R&D platform such as 5G, microbiome and auto electrification. To ensure we can meet additional demand generated by these programs, we will continue to implement key capacity expansions.","R&D initiatives and investments in innovation will also contribute to our 2030 sustainability initiatives and we look forward to reporting progress towards these goals. Our operating model enabled us to be agile and proactively respond to the dynamic market environment in 2019. This will be just as if not more important in 2020. Particular focus areas this year are continuing to advance productivity initiatives using digital tools and process simplification and rightsizing the organization. With a high performing operating model, focus on innovation and defined targets for working capital improvement, we expect to enable further improvement in both ROIC and free cash flow conversion. Active portfolio management remains a key component of our strategy. Ed will address this in more depth during his remarks.","Slide 7 details the actions underway, as well as those actions we expect to put in place in response to both the macro environment and our operating challenges. We expect that the completion of the DowDuPont synergies and the 2019 restructuring plan will provide approximately $215 million of gross cost savings in 2020. These programs are well defined and the teams are executing the actions needed to deliver these savings. We are also planning further cost reductions this year to enable us to better maintain our operating leverage as we committed. These actions will also start to address the stranded costs we expect following completion of the N&B transaction. We anticipate approximately $90 million of savings from these initiatives. In addition, we have launched a project to consolidate our asset footprint, which we expect to generate a total of greater than $150 million of savings over a three-year period with the first impact beginning in 2021. I will share more information on these items as they continue to take shape.","Before I turn the call over to Jean to discuss the fourth quarter, I'll cover our first quarter and full year guidance, starting with organic growth on Slide 8. For the full year, we expect sales of $21.5 billion to $22 billion, which is up slightly on an organic growth basis. We anticipate a return to more normal growth in all our core segments except T&I, which is being impacted by continued weakness in the automotive market and nylon industry headwinds, which I'll cover when reviewing EPS expectations. T&I is expected to deliver 2% to 5% organic growth, as memory markets return to a more normal growth profile in the back half of the year. Next generation smartphones with higher content of our materials continue to penetrate the market and we already started to see these volumes in the second half of last year. N&B is expected to grow 3% to 4% organically with strong volumes across all three businesses led by a return to growth in our probiotics business from the actions we're taking to win new business in North America as well as the strong Chinese market continued acceleration of our offerings into the alternative meat market and strength in food enzymes.","S&C is also expected to grow 2% to 3% organically from continued strong demand in Water Solutions, further pricing gains and resolution of the raw material supply shortages that limited production in the back half of last year in Safety Solutions. Non-core is expected to decline 3% to 5% organically from lower demand for trichlorosilane to the Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture and for SORONA in carpet and apparel applications.","Moving to full year adjusted EPS expectations on Slide 9. This year, we expect adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.90 per share, as higher volumes cost reductions and productivity improvements are offset by net headwinds from discrete items in 2019 and lower nylon prices coupled with a weaker nylon mix. From a quarterly perspective, these headwinds are most pronounced in the first quarter, which I'll cover on the next slide.","I'll now go into further detail on the nylon dynamics we're facing. Nylon industry fundamentals were weaker in the second half of 2019, as the lower demand coupled with improved industry supply reliability negatively impacted our discretionary pricing power. We anticipate a similar operating environment as we enter 2020 and forecast T&I segment prices will be down about mid-single digits. Primarily due to lower year-over-year nylon prices and weaker mix resulting in pricing headwinds of approximately $200 million to $250 million.","For context in 2018 T&I segment earnings were up 20% as steady demand coupled with industry-wide supply disruption and force measures and nylon 66 and key raw materials fueled higher prices with our pricing peaking in the first quarter of 2019. With the supply issues resolved and weak auto build forecast for 2020 market prices for nylon have been pressured and are expected to continue to decline as the year progresses, with the most significant impact in the first half of 2020. Additionally, we can demand in our core markets has resulted in a shift towards more opportunistic lower margin nylon sales so that we can fill our assets resulting in a weaker mix of products sold we have and continue to implement a series of actions to moderate the pricing impact focused on productivity and asset utilization, while we anticipate a challenging 2020 for T&I, we remain [Technical Difficulty] on our mid to long-term outlook. Aerospace, health care and auto electrification continue to provide steady demand and our deep innovation capabilities have us well positioned for renewed growth as markets recover.","In summary, our T&I expectations for this year are disappointing but I'm confident that we will continue to take the right actions to drive sustainable long-term growth.","Moving to Q1 on Slide 10. As I noted, our growth headwinds are most pronounced in the first quarter and predominantly encompass declines from lower discrete item gains, weakened nylon dynamics and unplanned outages and S&C. Once we get past the first quarter, we expect the nylon headwinds to abate given the peak of nylon pricing was in Q1 of last year. In addition, our Kevlar assets that are causing the headwinds in S&C are already back up and running. These dynamics, coupled with the 2020 cost actions that will start to ramp up to the first quarter, give us confidence that we can return to a more normal pattern of growth beyond the first quarter. This quarter, we anticipate sales to decline in the mid-single digits, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 per share. The top and bottom-line declines are driven by nylon headwinds and the unplanned outages in our S&C segment. Additionally, there were approximately $80 million or $0.08 per share of discrete items in the first quarter of 2019 that will not repeat.","Jean will cover some additional guidance detail in her comments and in the appendix we have provided segment level commentary as well as some additional modeling specifics.","I will now turn the call over to her.","Jean Desmond","Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 11, we closed the quarter about where we expected from a top-line and EPS perspective. As we mentioned on our mid-December call, our operating EBITDA was going to be at the low end of the range, which is consistent with our reported results. In total, operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion was down 14% versus the prior year. Driven by lower gains in our non-core segments associated with customer settlements from our Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture as well as lower nylon pricing in our T&I segment. I'll get into further segment detail in a few moments.","While many of the market challenges that Marc mentioned for the year also impacted our fourth quarter, the team's disciplined focus on driving price and executing on our cost saving initiatives [Technical Difficulty]. Net sales of $5.2 billion were in line with our expectations and down 2% organically versus the prior year.","Our Electronics & Imaging business had the strongest results this quarter, led by further expansion of our content in the newer high-speed, high-frequency phones which generated greater than $1 per phone of additional sales for us. We also continue to see strength in our Water Solutions business, which was up in the low teen driving overall organic growth in the S&C segment. A few additional bright spot, I would highlight from the quarter in our Nutrition & Biosciences segment, these include our offerings into the alternative or plant-based meat market, which is included in the Food & Beverage business. And our animal nutrition and food enzymes business, both of which fall into our Health & Biosciences business.","Moving to the fourth quarter adjusted EPS on Slide 13. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.95 was down 34%. I'll highlight two items within the segment results that are specific to the fourth quarter. First is lower equity affiliate income, specifically our Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture within the non-core segment. Equity affiliate income on an adjusted basis declined about $120 million or 42% to $166 million. This decline is mostly attributable to lower income associated with customer settlement from the Hemlock joint venture. These settlements were at their peak in 2018 and have trailed off substantially in 2019. We expect another significant decline into 2020 from further reductions in the customer settlement and declines in underlying results as customers are released from the contract.","Also specific to the fourth quarter was the price decline in Transportation & Industrial segments. Although, we started to see sequential pricing pressure earlier this year following the peak in first quarter 2019. The year-over-year price only move negative on it in the fourth quarter and down 2%. Tax was a headwind in the quarter due to a lower rate in the prior year, driven by benefits from the DowDuPont transaction that did not repeat. Our full year rate of 21% is in line with our expectations.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14, you'll see that our net debt increased slightly to $15.9 billion, mostly attributable to lower cash balances as we ended the year. In the fourth quarter, we closed three acquisitions in the water space for a total of about $175 million and we made $185 million pension contribution that was triggered by the stand up of new DuPont. Share repurchases in the quarter were about $290 million, bringing our total repurchases since June 1, to $750 million. Excluding the pension contribution, which is reflected in operating cash flows, our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion was greater than 100%, again exceeding our target of greater than 90%. On the slide you can see the trend of working capital over the past five quarters. While I'm pleased that our working capital has improved in the back half of 2019. We are still above year-end 2018 levels and not where we need to be. This remains a key focus area of mine in 2020 to free up cash. We've put in place the working capital improvement target of 10% for the current year.","Shifting to a review of segment results and starting with Electronics & Imaging on Slide 15. Fourth quarter net sales were the strongest of the year at $937 million and were up 3% versus the prior year. Strength was led by our Interconnect Solutions business where our advanced materials are supporting the launch of next generation smartphones. Low-teens growth in the Interconnect business in the second half of '19 is a proof point that we have market-leading innovative solution to support the development of 5G technology. The strength in Interconnect Solutions was partially offset by softness in Semiconductor Technologies similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2019.","Our semiconductor business is about half exposed to memory, which remains sluggish, however, the overall semiconductor market is on a positive trajectory as evidenced by our sequential improvement in the last two quarters, and we expect the recovery to continue returning to more normal growth in the back half of this year.","Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment was $293 million, a decrease of 9% from pro forma operating EBITDA of $321 million in the year ago period. The mix shift between strength in Interconnect Solutions and softness in Semiconductor Technologies, the highest margin business within E&I created margin pressure leading to the EBITDA decline.","Moving to Nutrition & Biosciences on Slide 16. Net sales of $1.5 billion were flat on an organic basis, with 1% price improvement offset by 1% volume declines. For the fourth quarter strength in food enzymes, animal nutrition and our meat-free offerings, each of which were up mid to high-single digits in the quarter were able to offset market driven weakness in proteins, probiotics and biorefineries and supply chain disruptions in sweeteners. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment was $323 million, a decrease of 2% from pro forma operating EBITDA of $330 million in the year ago period.","Productivity and pricing gains were more than offset by manufacturing headwinds, unfavorable product mix and lower volumes. The unfavorable product mix was partially the result of softness in the North America probiotics market. Our business consistent with the market was down on a year-over-year basis for both the quarter and the year. We are working with channel partners accelerating initiatives to get the North America market back on track. While the North American market recovers, we expect that probiotics growth will continue to be fueled from Asia-Pacific, where current market penetration is low as compared to other regions, but growing steadily. For the year probiotic sales in China were up over 30%. Our Transportation & Industrial results on Slide 17 reflect lower auto builds and weak demand in electronic and modest continued destocking in the automotive channel.","Net sales of $1.2 billion were down 9% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment was $277 million decrease of 19% from pro forma operating EBITDA of $344 million in the year ago period with cost reductions and lower raw material costs being more than offset by lower volume and price headwinds.","Turning to the results of Safety & Construction on Slide 18, net sales of $1.3 billion were up 1% on an organic basis. Volumes are mixed with strength in areas such as Water Solutions were double-digit volume gains on strong demand for ion exchange and reverse osmosis membranes in industrial markets. Were more than offset by volume declines in Safety Solutions and continued softness in Shelter Solutions. Safety Solution demand remained steady across most product lines. However plans maintenance downtime and raw material disruptions in the supply chain limited production volumes. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment totaled $311 million flat with the year ago period with pricing gains and productivity actions being offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily from cost associated with planned maintenance and lower volumes.","I'll close with a few comments on our cash generation and needs in 2020 on Slide 19. We continue to expect to generate strong cash flows with the conversion rate greater than 90%. While many of the DowDuPont transaction related items are behind us, we will start to incur cost associated with our recently announced N&B transaction.","Our commercial paper balances at year-end were about $1.8 billion. I'm committed to bringing these balances down throughout the year. And finally, shareholder remuneration remains an important aspect of our overall capital allocation policy. While our current forecast has the majority of cash that we generate from normal operations going towards paying down commercial paper balances and the N&B transaction costs. We are targeting reducing working capital by about 10% this year. Which along with future non-core divestments would be targeted for share buyback.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Breen","Thanks, Jean. This morning I'll provide an update on the N&B and IFF transaction as well as say a few words on PFAS and the Chemours litigation. I continue to be excited about the value creation potential of our transaction with IFF and have confidence in a strong strategic logic for this combination. As a proof point, we have already heard from several large customers about their excitement over the portfolio breadth and technology depth for the new combined company.","As you can see on Slide 20, we have already begun working on the integration and a rigorous process is being run to ensure this go smoothly. As you know, DuPont and N&B team specifically as a lot of experience in this area starting 10 years ago with the integration of Danisco into DuPont and then more recently executing the complex integration of the Dow and FMC portfolios with our business. In addition to the internal combination of the former Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences business, we know how to do this and we will execute the same playbook that has worked so well for us in the past.","Some of the key short-term milestones that have already been completed, are the establishment of the executive steering team and the appointment of leaders for key work streams, including separation and integration, our financials, IT separation and stand up, legal entity work and talent selection. The teams at both IFF and N&B are well staffed and I am confident we will stay on track with our plan.","Beyond the N&B transaction, we continue to believe our portfolio presents many ways to create shareholder value, and we continue to assess our options. I'll close with a few words on the Chemours lawsuit and PFAS. We continue to believe our potential risk exposure remains contained and I feel it's worthwhile to underscore that point while also updating a couple of items we discussed on our last call. Regarding the Ohio MDL personal injury claims, two related cases are currently being tried together in Ohio as we speak. Chemours continues to indemnify and defend these cases and others subject to eliminate cost sharing agreement.","As I mentioned last time, we still have not contributed $0.01 in excess of the $25 million trigger and by default Chemours has not spent more than $25 million. With respect to the South Carolina MDL most of these cases are tied to allegations of PFAS containing firefighting foam use over the last 60 years. These suits relate largely to PFOS a chemical that neither Chemours or historical DuPont ever made or sold. The same is true for firefighting foam. Historical DuPont was not a manufacturer of foam but for a limited period along with numerous others provide an ingredient to foam manufacturer. This ingredient could lead to trace amounts of PFOA but absolutely no PFAS which is the primary concern. We continue to believe that the exposure of Historical DuPont where Chemours is negligible compared to those that manufactured marketed and sold these materials.","We also continue to defend ourselves against various natural resource damages cases, most of which are in states where we never had a manufacturing presence. These claims in the focus on foam or generic PFAS containing products. We take these cases very seriously and monitor developments closely. However, we still believe that direct impacts to DuPont are limited and are being managed appropriately. As to the Chemours suit in late December the Delaware Chancery Court heard our arguments to dismiss the case and send it to arbitration. We thought our argument went well and we expect a decision by the end of this quarter or early next.","I'll now turn it to Lori to open for Q&A.","Lori Koch","Thank you, Ed. With that, let's move on to your questions. First, I would like to remind you that our forward looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. We will allow for one question per person. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Yes, thank you. Good morning, everybody. You sound like you have a little bit of a cold, I hope you haven't been to Wuhan, China recently.","Ed Breen","No, but I do have a bad cold, so I apologize.","John Inch","It could be a lot worse. So, understanding some of the first quarter of 2020 compares issues such as the one-timer's. Still if I annualize the midpoint of your first quarter guide you get about $0.90 short of your fiscal year -- fiscal year estimate. So, I'm just curious, what are the key drivers of your post 1Q growth assumptions, your confidence level there. And then just secondly, your $1 billion working capital opportunity that you call out in the slides. Is that tied to your 2021 asset footprint rationalization initiative, are these two discrete buckets that lead to two discrete streams of benefit. Thank you.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks, John for that question. This is Marc. Let me take it to give Ed voice a bit of a break and then he can jump in and I'll ask Jean to take the working capital question. Just starting with the first quarter, you're right, it is an abnormally weak quarter. But I'll tell you in terms of the second quarter on, we do have strong confidence in our forecast. We're not assuming a recovery for the markets here. We've got a number of things that are really under our control happening from Q1 to Q2, and it starts with sort of the typical seasonal lift that happens from 1Q to 2Q most every year, but also we've got a significant change in the one-timer's because there is a sizable settlement associated with the Hemlock joint venture in the second quarter which is worth about $80 million in EBITDA. And then on top of that, the S&C manufacturing headwinds that we had that hit us in the first quarter are largely behind us now. So, we're confident that the S&C business will be back to sort of normal supply against continued strong demand.","And then final kicker, the cost actions we announced here which we've kicked off are going to start to deliver in the second quarter and that will be worth another about $0.05 per share going forward per quarter. So, when we wrap these things up, it provides us confidence that the second quarter is going to be kind of back to a more normal earnings environment.","Jean Desmond","Yes. So, in terms of working capital, really it's separate and apart from the asset rationalization. This is the working capital opportunity that we identified at the time we brought the portfolios together. Now, unfortunately as we went through the separation process with Dow, DuPont and Corteva, our working capital balances actually increased with all the system freezes we had and we built inventory and then as we came into '19 and we saw slowdowns in some of our markets that exacerbated the problem. So, we are taking a very, very strong effort in 2020 to reduce working capital. But as I said 10%. We've got teams activated it to do that effort and you should see that benefit separate and apart from these others. I would think, longer-term with the asset rationalization. We will have additional working capital benefits, but those will be further out past 2020.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thanks. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to kind of come back to manufacturing, the S&C item, as you said, it sounds like it gets ironed out, you also you mentioned some manufacturing issues in N&B, we've heard a few of these over the last several quarters. I wonder if you could just address Marc whether kind of the manufacturing side of the equation is largely kind of settled here post separation. Is there any particular disruptions going on as you try to get after synergies. It would just be nice, not have to kind of talk about these issues?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Couldn't agree more. I'd call some of this, particularly like in N&B, these things are abnormal that happened once in a blue moon. S&C is the one that's really been the most pronounced and you know it's -- it's a few quarters running now. But for different reasons. So if you -- if I take you back to last year, we had a real strong first half in S&C and then we did run into a disruption in our supply chain for key material in Kevlar raw material, supplier disruption and that was part of the weakness in the third quarter. The fourth quarter, we had a planned maintenance sort of a two-year every two year maintenance cycle on Nomex but that had an earnings impact in the quarter and now we've got a subsequent outage again in the Kevlar manufacturing line and it's a little bit connected to that raw material shortage because our inventories were so tight after that, that a small disruption in manufacturing here has really had a bigger impact on the quarter.","And so, to your question on the kind of operational stability, I'd say, first of all by and large 180 manufacturing sites around the world. We've got strong performance. We're making investments in productivity. We're making investments in digital. I've got confidence in our operations leadership around the world. Our safety performance by the way, was a record last year for us as a company in the history of the company. And so, I think the team are doing the blocking and tackling. The Kevlar issues and S&C are extremely frustrating to us and to our Kevlar business team, but we feel pretty good. Just in terms of where the units running right now and given a couple of months to catch back up with inventory, we think we'll be able to weather any future disruption there. And so, hopefully this is behind us and as you said, we won't be talking about this every quarter.","Operator","And next we will hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Ed, if I could ask you on the PFAS, the personal injury cases, originally there was, there was a settlement of personal injury cases a few years ago. So, I'm just curious why not settle these cases. I mean we've subsequently seen the jackpot that are going against Bayer in the glyphosate cases. So, why not settle these and how confident are you that this doesn't spiral into something that we don't want to deal with?","Ed Breen","Yes. So, thanks for the question, Vincent. Look, there's about 60 of these cases outstanding. These two are in trial right now. I can't necessarily forecast the outcome, but there is always the opportunity here to settle and settlement usually happens kind of in this window of time. So, it's possible that that will be the outcome. So, we'll just have to see over the next ensuing weeks, how that plays out, but obviously we're very cognizant of the point that the question that you just asked.","Operator","And next we'll hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Ed, can you address the issue in terms of the discount in the share price due to PFOA and the potential and desire to do additional tax efficient transactions for the portfolio perhaps with the electronics franchise? Thank you.","Ed Breen","Yes, so let me go back, maybe just high-level to the IFF transaction and just talk about that a moment also. You all have done the math and I read it all your reports. But you just do the math, IFF as it stands right now and RemainCo DuPont trades at about eight times. So, I think this will play out. Just on the IFF transaction as we get closer to it. I would also mention, I really believe and we're hearing this from our customers. Pretty broadly that we've created the de facto leading platform in the industry. By way, it's incumbent upon us and IFF to elegantly pull this merger off with each other and we will do that. I know we have to prove that to everybody, I understand that. But IFF also trades at a discount to the top peer set in the industry by about 500 basis points. So, I think there is great leverage here in creating this phenomenal company, both the value we're getting initially out of it and the value that can be created over the next couple of years with that transaction, but having still said that we trade at peak times of RemainCo.","Let me just say this, and I don't want to get into too much detail on it, but we're actively in conversations with others. I like tax efficient transactions that we like creating global leading companies and we are very agnostic, we want to do the right thing for our shareholders and also we'll pursue those opportunities and we're assessing that with our Board as we speak.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Good morning, guys. Just on the kind of news flow that's out there. It was, it seem to be kind of the discussion that you guys were looking at on the back of the last question, something around the T&I business. But then there was some news flow to that, there was something perhaps on the electronic side, can you just talk about, I mean is it that, is the situation with your portfolio, kind of that fluid that you can kind of pivot from one to the other like that. I know there's a bit of a restriction on how much you can actually sell down with that with that EBITDA floor. But maybe, is it really kind of that fluid?","Ed Breen","No, actually it's not, it's fluid is that sounds: it's a shame that those kind of leaks occur and it's also not great for our employees to be hearing one rumor after another to be honest with you. So, I don't want to comment in too much detail but by way Steve, to your point, we do have an agreement with Corteva that we ought to maintain $2.5 billion of EBITDA that stays with the liability. Having said that doesn't mean we can't separate things if we want to and I'm not saying we are, but if we want to, we can an separate into different businesses, but we would have to leave $2.5 billion of EBITDA liability with \u2013 it could be two entities, by the way we leave it with. So, we have a fair amount of flexibility in front of us. But \u2013 so, we don't have to hold it in one entity. If we don't want to.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. In the spirit of your comments about innovation, Marc, I wondered if you had any thoughts about using some of your technologies to maybe take a little more of a proactive stance on these PFAS liabilities. For example, using your skills in water treatment to help these municipalities that have PFAS unrelated to legacy DuPont sites, but just for goodwill like, three, Fayetteville pulls water that's got 20 parts per trillion PFO a PFOS and its upstream from the Chemours plant or use your capabilities in probiotics to develop bacteria that can degrade these chlorinated compounds in these industrial wastewater treatment plants. Your thoughts on that.","Marc Doyle","Yes, yes. Thanks, Steve. It's a great question. And actually we published some commitments as new DuPont late last year and those included kind of our commitments for use of PFAS in our products and manufacturing and the my perspective on this is, is that this isn't so much about health effects, at the low levels of exposure, we're talking about, but the fact that these long chain chemicals or bio accumulative, is just unacceptable these days to all of us. And so, we made a statement that included that we would be ending all use in our product lines we'd be driving the use of PFAS free fire-fighting foams at all of our manufacturing sites to be a leader there and we made a commitment around our water business and just year point, we've been pretty active in the water space. Now, this is, as you're probably aware the heritage Dow Water Solutions business, then a leader in the global water industry for decades. We've been of course investing aggressively in that business because the growth is fantastic, and those acquisitions we made last year. Of course, sort of further strengthen our portfolio now so that we've got offerings that span from US to Ion Exchange to reverse osmosis.","And Ion Exchange in RO in particular are pretty effective techniques for removal of traits PFAS compounds. And so, one of the commitments we made in the -- in that document last year was to provide technology including royalty free licenses to certain pieces of IP that we had around the PFAS area. We're also working very actively on product developments that would allow our materials, our components to be targeted to clean up activities. And so just as you said, we're trying to do the right thing, working around the country and areas where there is need here.","Ed Breen","By the way, I would just add, as a point back whole PFAS conversation and you know we've been sued by the State of Michigan and just to make a point back to my prepared remarks, we had no manufacturing facility there that used any of those materials. It's more of a firefighting foam case. And so, I think as it plays out in the fax early on the table. We had nothing to do in that state with any of that.","Operator","Our next we'll hear from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jonas Oxgaard","Well, thank you. I was curious about the automotive. So, a two-part question on which we strip out the nylon impact. What does that business look like in 2020. And what underlying automotive market growth do you use for that outlook?","Marc Doyle","Yes, thanks, Jonas, it's a good question. So, just starting with the underlying market growth, we're assuming our planning assumption is a continued slight contraction in the auto industry for 2020 like minus 1% with respect to builds this year. So, that's another contraction versus the more significant contraction last year. When you strip out nylon pricing. We are expecting our engineering plastics to continue to grow from a volume perspective, a little bit faster than the market. We're expecting destocking, we're seeing that destocking is pretty well ended. And so, that provides some sequential improvement in the situation. And then on top of that, we're benefiting from some of the growth drivers, like auto electrification and EV sales were up double digits, last year, expected to be up double-digits this year. We're seeing our growth into electric vehicles growing even faster than that. And so, that's starting to become a more significant driver.","So, you're absolutely right. The nylon pricing dynamics are so significant they're kind of overwhelming a lot of the positives. But there are some bright spots or green shoots there underneath that. On top of that I just add, you know given the nylon situation, we are taking some pretty aggressive action around cost control and that includes productivity actions in the sites. The production sites, but also the G&A costs at the business level, to try to tighten up the belt as much as we can to mitigate some of that pricing downside that we're seeing.","Operator","Next we'll hear from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John McNulty","Thanks for taking -- thanks for taking my question. So, with regard to the non-core assets. Can you give us an update on how the sales are looking there and I understand the Hemlock businesses is a little bit more complicated, but is that something you feel like you can get pulled off by the end of the year this year? Thanks.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks, John. This is Marc. I'll take that. Yes. So, we feel pretty confident we're going to continue to make progress and like we said, the last couple of quarters. My expectation is, you'll see kind of a steady drip of progress here across the businesses and non-core. Hard to time, obviously a lot of work behind the scenes on transactions. A lot of rumors, I saw that there was a new one this week that came out. I'd say ignore the rumors, but have confidence that we're working hard to execute the non-core divestitures and we should see progress quarter-by-quarter here.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Great, thank you. Within the S&C segment, you've obviously had good margin progress over the last few years. But more recently, obviously faced some procurement challenges outages, etc. Can you just walk us through your intermediate to long-term expectations for S&C margins, just given the current asset footprint, procurement strategy evolution. And then also the growth outlook for and mix expectations for both on individual rebound for Safety Solutions and momentum in RO membranes in water. Just any color would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes, absolutely right. We had great progress on S&C margins through '18, first half of '19. We've stumbled a bit now in the last few quarters. And as I said earlier, the majority of that is really operational issues in the aramids business and Safety Solutions. We are pretty confident that that's behind us. When you look at the demand environment. So, we've got three primary markets that we're exposed to safety, water and shelter, no big trajectory change year-over-year in the market environments. So, the demand is still very strong and water strong in safety, kind of pockets of weakness and shelter, but no big trajectory change. And so, in that environment, with the operational issues resolved, we feel pretty good that we'll see the margins come back to what we said is the kind of operating range that we expect sort of mid to high '20s range. And then going forward as water grows, Water segment margins are strong, a little bit above the average. With the acquisitions we made. We've got some further upside to drive margin improvement. And so, I would expect that to provide longer-term lift in terms of what we could expect margins to continue to do.","So, I'm feeling pretty good. You know we got through some issues here, we should see with continued demand, the margin strengthened and then we've got some longer-term upside on top of that.","Jean Desmond","And maybe just to follow-up on Marc's comments, if you look at Safety within Safety & Construction has the highest margins and our largest capital investment that we're making. We've talked about before the tie back line eight that we're building in Luxembourg, so obviously that's not an impact on 2020. But if we go towards the future. And we look at the needs for tie back for medical packaging and for protective garments, we'll see I think will have the capacity to meet what we expect to be continued strong demand in that space.","Marc Doyle","That will be accretive to margins over time as we get the new asset up and running and filled. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bob Koort","Hi, everyone. This is -- hi guys. Quick question on the nylon if you, I know you guys got out of nylon commodity years ago within Vista [ph]. I guess I'd assume that engineering polymers business maybe had a little bit more downstream high value offering. So, why is it that you're exposed to that nylon pricing risk in not really passing through whatever you need to in order to recover that. And then secondly that you talked about trying to keep tax leakage at a minimum. Do you also worry about value leakage here if you try to monetize some of these assets when they're not exactly pumping with us all cylinders going at the present time. Thanks.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks, Bob. I'll take the first one and then turn it over to Ed, give Ed a chance for his voice to prepare itself. Yes, it's a great question on nylon. So, just to be clear, this isn't raw material cost fluctuations. So, there is not exactly a pass-through, but you could challenge fairly are we getting the value for our nylon compounds, which are we call the trade name Zytel. Zytel is a differentiated product. It's a market-leading product, it's got unique properties in terms of temperature mechanical for applications. Automotive is sort of the highest value space sizable market, where Zytel is used. So, what's really happening here is us making the decision, that to continue to stay in the game for new qualifications in the auto space. We do have competitors that are at lower price. We've got to move price a little closer to where now the competitors are in order to continue to be re-qualified for future applications. And so, it's a delicate balance. I mean we do try to price for value, but at the end of the day, we're not the only supplier of nylon compositions in the market. And so, that's the kind of balance here that's happening.","Ed Breen","Yes, to the other question. Look, the way I would answer it is very similar to what we did with IFF. We have great franchises that we have in our respective industries and let me just use electronics now as an example. The premier companies are trading literally 600 to 700 basis points above ours. We have a great franchise and electronics. If we were to do something in one of our other businesses, it was a tax advantage transaction. We would get the equivalent value out of it. Just like we did in the IFF transaction with the right appropriate multiple that industry should have. So, whether the industry is up a little right now or down a little bit right now is sort of your irrelevant in one of those deals as long as you lock in the proper multiple that you deserve in that industry. So again, I'm not saying we're doing something tomorrow, we're assessing our options we are talking to people here. But clearly, we can get the value out of a transaction if we want to do something. If by the way, if we were outright going to sell something right now it take cash for it. Yes, you got assesses the industry opposite down at all that, are you getting the proper value at the right time. But just going back to the transaction, we already announced. We don't have to worry about that. In that we think we're creating long-term great value by creating the de facto world leader in that industry and that's the take the things we're looking at.","Operator","Next, we will hear from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. You noted a big mix effect in the Electronics & Imaging segment. Is that lower margins in the Imaging segment versus electronics, a wide range of margins within electronics?","Marc Doyle","Yes, it's more of the latter, so the semi, we've got three businesses there. Interconnect Solutions, Semiconductor Technologies and Image Solutions as you said, and the Semiconductor Technologies business is the highest margin segment and the margins are about 700 basis points over higher than the average for E&I. So, it's a pretty significant mix effect semi as you know was soft all year. I'd say the benefit is that, we did see some sequential improvement now two quarters running in the semi business. And so, as we've seen from the semi companies out there. We're starting to see the signs of a recovery here for 2020 and so, we're confident that some growth in semi, as well as the, the margin mix improvement will be a key kicker for E&I this year.","Operator","And we will take our final question from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.","PJ Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning. And I want to go back to your -- yes good morning. So, you are seeing compression in line in nylon pricing. A lot of these Engineered Materials start out of the specialties and then get commoditized over time. Are you seeing commoditization in nylon or is there a new China competition or is it just that the capacity that was down is starting back?","Marc Doyle","Yes, it's really that. Yes, good question, PJ, this is Marc. I'll take that. I mean there is no change. No significant change in the competitive environment, still the same group of major suppliers globally all fairly sizable multinationals. This is really the demand environment and automotive being so soft for an extended period. That's really impacting the pricing dynamics. And so, for us in terms of actions to take, I mean I talked about cost and productivity. We've got to continue to develop high-value applications, so diversifying out of automotive -- automotive is a great space for nylon because of the temperature mechanical properties. But we are focused on industrial applications obviously electric vehicles, that core will continue to create value. We still think the competitive dynamics globally are good here, but it's really, as I said, it's really the demand environment that's causing the pain.","Lori Koch","Thank you, everyone for joining our call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Quarterly Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] To listen to the webcast, please go to www.dupont.com. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you may begin your conference.","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay, thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. With me this morning are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; and Nick Fanandakis, EVP and CFO. The slides for today's call can be found on our website at dupont.com, along with the news release that was issued earlier today. ","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risk and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you please refer to the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with the earnings news release and on our website. And finally, we've posted supplemental information on the website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3 for highlights on our 2011 performance. Full year sales were up 20%, including 5 percentage points from the Danisco acquisition. Segments with the largest organic sales growth in 2011, net of acquisitions, were Performance Chemicals and Agriculture. Sales in developing markets were up 27%, and that represents 34% of company sales.","Market-driven science is critical to our success, and we expect to have about 30% of 2011 sales come from products that were introduced in the past 4 years, and we'll be finalizing that data in February.","Fixed cost and working capital productivity surpassed the targets we set for the year. Fixed cost productivity exceeded our target by $100 million, and working capital productivity beat the target by $200 million. Variable cost productivity programs, they also delivered comparable results. ","DuPont delivered a record $3.93 per share in 2011 on an underlying basis, which is up 20% versus 2010, capping off a very strong year with broad-based contributions. We ended the year with $3.3 billion in free cash flow compared to $3.1 billion last year, an improvement of 8%.","During the fourth quarter, we faced several headwinds. When we updated our full year guidance on December 9, we pointed to market softness in electronics and customers' conservative year-end cash management with further destocking in polymer and industrial supply chain. We have also made clear that the photovoltaic inventory correction continued through the quarter. These factors combined to press volume down 10%. Despite these difficult conditions, underlying earnings were up in the fourth quarter when adjusted for the differences in tax rate year-over-year. Our earnings performance demonstrates an ability to execute extremely well in volatile and uncertain markets. It is our view that fourth quarter volume performance was strongly impacted by cash conservation and supply chain actions, and did not reflect broad macro conditions. ","There was GDP growth in the quarter in most regions, with growth also projected for 2012. The good news is that caution in the fourth quarter means that many supply chain inventories are fit. We expect some conservatism to linger in the first quarter, with a rebound effect likely to come in the second quarter, and I'll provide a more detailed perspective on how we see the rebound effect playing out later on this call.","To further illustrate my point that fourth quarter volume was primarily a function of cash conservation and supply chain restocking rather than macro conditions, I'll share fourth quarter perspectives on key markets. Let's start with electronics, where continued destocking in PV was expected. As the channel corrects for significant overproduction in the first half of 2011, we expect destocking to be completed by midyear, perhaps sooner, with PV installations to be up about 10% in 2012. Remember, PV sales represent about 40% of the electronics segment. For consumer electronics, the seasonal decline in orders was more than expected, in part due to delays in launch timing for next generation smartphones and tablet PCs, coupled with some destocking and caution in the value chain through the quarter. Auto builds were essentially flat, with gains in the U.S. and Japan offset by declines in every other region. Our Performance Materials segment was affected by destocking in their supply chain, most notably in Europe and Asia Pacific. As expected, the titanium dioxide market experienced a pause, with volumes down and prices up year-over-year. For added perspective, our full year TiO2 volume was down modestly in 2011 versus a sold-out position in 2010, and expectations for volume growth in 2012. TiO2 demand, on average, tends to follow GDP, and with no major tranches of new capacity coming on in the next 24 months, we expect this market to remain strong, with solid fundamentals and healthy returns.","And speaking of strong market fundamentals, our ag businesses continue to deliver impressive results. Fourth quarter sales were up 8% on 3% volume growth. However, the real story is the Latin American summer season, which primarily spans our third and fourth quarters. So for the second half, the ag segment sales were up 23%, and underlying PTOI was up 43%. These outstanding results reflect a constant press of product lineup in Latin America, with industry-leading germplasm, coupled with more than 85% insect rate penetration in Brazil corn.  Our Right Product, Right Acre approach is delivering strong sales, share gains and, most importantly, delighted customers. ","Pulling this all together, we dealt with a wide range of market conditions at year-end. We remain close to our customers, often taking advantage of market positives to accelerate new product valuations. ","So I'd like to highlight a few innovation achievements as we closed out the year. In the fourth quarter, we announced a licensing agreement with a major Asian manufacturer for OLED technology. This acknowledges that we have achieved a major milestone in demonstrating technology that enables large displays to be produced at significantly lower cost than competing technologies. And we're quickly moving into small-scale semi-works production where we would develop basic data and supply materials for prove out by interested partners.","Rynaxypyr insecticide sales reached $580 million this year, with a strong finish in Latin America and Asia. For context, this means this product line represents about 20% of total sales in our crop protection business. We look forward to the launching of the next product in this family, Cyazypyr, in the later part of 2012. ","We received regulatory approval last summer for the next wave of integrated and reduced refuge products, Optimum AcreMax and Optimum AcreMax XTRA, which will deliver significant value this year for our customers. And we look forward to the regulatory approval of AcreMax Extreme in the first half of 2012. ","And last month, the Society of Plastics Engineers announced their award for Most Innovative Use of Plastic, and DuPont products were featured in 3 separate awards for Ford, Fiat and Toyota. Two of the innovative components featured renewably sourced material, including our bio-based Sorona polymer in the carpeting application. ","Finally, for the 2011 year, DuPont was granted a total of 910 U.S. patents, the highest number for a single year in the company's history, and I'm extremely proud of our scientists who developed these proprietary innovations and of our marketers whose understanding of customers' unmet needs shaped these research and development programs. ","So now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for a detailed review of the financial results of the quarter, and then I'll share my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. In spite of volatile market conditions, DuPont delivered a record year in 2011, with underlying earnings of $3.93 per share, which, as Ellen already mentioned, was a 20% improvement over 2010. Our exceptional performance continues to demonstrate our ability to successfully focus on innovation, productivity and differential management. Ellen's already given you a sense of the dynamic market conditions that we faced during the fourth quarter, so I'll go straight to the financial details of the quarter, which played out as expected and consistent with our updated guidance in December. ","Let's start with Slide 4, which is a summary of earnings and sales results. Fourth quarter total segment PTOI increased over $100 million or 16%. Earnings per share were $0.35 on an underlying basis compared to $0.50 in the prior year. The decrease here was due to the significantly higher tax rate, which was a negative $0.23 per share impact year-over-year. ","Consolidated net sales of $8.4 billion were up 14% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 14%, with double-digit increases in all regions, reflecting our continued strong discipline of pricing for value. The Danisco acquisition was the primary driver for the 10% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was down 10%, primarily reflecting supply chain destocking that Ellen has already covered.","Now, let's turn to a corporate view of the fourth quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 5. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.43 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to successfully implement price increases, pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver. On a full year basis, this spread was a positive $1.41 per share.","Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 15% versus last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we saw an increase of 13% over 2010, and this includes about 3 percentage points for metals, which, as you know, is passed through. As we indicated in December, we expect an increase of about 4% for the full year 2012.","Volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.20 per share. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. The decline in volume reflects decreases in all regions and all segments, except for Agriculture, reflecting the market environment that Ellen has previously discussed. On a full year basis, total company volume was up 1%, with ag volume up 10%.","Continuing with our variance analysis, let's now move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.17 per share, and this was primarily driven by actions in the fourth quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 capacity expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at some of our existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration of the marketplace.","On a full year basis, fixed costs were 40% of sales versus 42% last year, well on our way to meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrent with the actions to support growth, we delivered more than $400 million of fixed cost savings in 2011. As we told you during Investor Day last month, we expect to deliver another $300 million of fixed-cost productivity in 2012.  Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter and $0.17 on a full year basis.","Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates and cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is shown on Schedule D in the earnings news release to depict the exact number our hedging program had on our earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.","Income tax on the EPS waterfall is a $0.23 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter, which was 27.5%, versus a negative 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our full year tax rate of 22% was higher than our expected full year tax rate of 21%, reflecting an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. This impact was recognized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a higher 27.5% rate. Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the full year tax rate was lower than expected because of 100% of the U.S. R&D tax credit which was recorded in the quarter, and it resulted in a negative 14.9% rate.  The full year 2011 impact of the 22% tax rate versus our previous guidance of 21% is about a $0.05 per share headwind. ","Next on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. This includes earnings, additional interest and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that were not included in our one-time items. On a full year reported basis, Danisco diluted earnings by $0.13 a share. This includes underlying results of $0.09, offset by significant items associated with the transaction and cost to achieve synergies of $0.22 per share. As we discussed during Investor Day, we are committed to achieving at least $130 million of cost synergies in 2012, which is a full year ahead of original expectation.","There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 6. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 14% in the quarter and 27% for the full year. ","Turning now to balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. We ended the year with $3.3 billion of free cash flow versus the prior year of $3.1 billion. This outstanding performance is the result of strong sales and earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity.  At the end of 2011, on a 12-month trailing basis versus the end of 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 7%, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and delivering $500 million of productivity this year.  Combining this with a more than $700 million of productivity in 2010, we have already surpassed our commitment to deliver $1 billion of working capital productivity between 2010 and 2012. And I'll reaffirm our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2012. ","We ended 2011 with a net debt of $8.5 billion, which is approximately $5 billion more than our position in December of 2010. This increase reflects $7 billion acquisition of Danisco, partially offset by exceptional free cash flow performance for the year. ","I want to give a quick update on our pension contributions. Last week, we made the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan we had communicated to you on Investor Day. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A\/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. During 2011, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders, unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.","In summary for the fourth quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one, with agricultural and food markets continuing to be strong while we experienced destocking in several supply chains. In spite of these market conditions, we were able to deliver a double-digit increase in total segment underlying PTOI, which is a testament to our pricing discipline and productivity focus.","Turning now to 2012, we are reaffirming the guidance we gave at Investor Day of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, an increase of 7% to 12% from 2011. However, I'd like to provide you with an update on 2 of our financial assumptions, currency and the tax rate, that were a part of our guidance on Investor Day.  Currency rates remain volatile, and at current rates, we expect the U.S. dollar to be about 6% stronger in 2012 versus our previous assumptions of 3%. The 6% stronger dollar translates to about a $0.25 per share headwind on a year-over-year basis or an additional $0.12 per share headwind versus our previous assumptions. For the first quarter, the stronger dollar is about $0.08 headwind versus prior year. ","Turning to tax rate. We said in 2012 that the planned rate would be about 22%. We communicated this during Investor Day. We now expect the full year tax rate to be about 23%, which is a $0.05 per share headwind versus the previous guidance, reflecting unfavorable geographic mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions.","From a market perspective, our assumptions are essentially in line with what we shared with you during Investor Day. We expect to see some of the softness from the fourth quarter continuing in the first quarter, with the industrial markets rebounding further into 2012. For PV, we expect inventories to correct in the second quarter of 2012, followed by a rebound in manufacturing, with growth and installations of about 10% for the full year. ","Consumer electronics, we'll see weak demand early in the year, with market recovery later in the year driven by smartphones and tablets, with good year-over-year growth in 2012. In TiO2, Agriculture and food, the fundamentals remain strong.","While acknowledging that the 2 updated financial assumptions do create downward pressure on the 2012 guidance, it's still very early in the year. Macro conditions remain volatile, including currency, and much could change between now and the end of this year. To combat these challenges, we remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. The businesses are staying close to the customers to better understand demand signals. We know what levers to pull to meet our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership teams remain confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are reaffirming our previous 2012 guidance.","In summary, we had a record year in 2011 in terms of underlying earnings per share. You can once again see the strength of the result that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio to its more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, you can expect us to continue to deliver superior results.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?","Karen A. Fletcher","Thanks, Nick. We'll start with our segment review with Agriculture on Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 8%, with volume gains of 3% and price gains of 5%. The seasonal PTOI loss of $116 million was lower than previous year losses due to increased sales. Fourth quarter does not reflect the majority of any single season since much of the impact of Latin America's summer season is captured in our third quarter results. Most of Brazil's Safrinha season is captured in our first quarter results, and most of northern hemisphere sales are captured in our first and second quarter results. ","Our full year performance clearly shows the power of the businesses. Our teams delivered 17% sales growth with 10% volume gains, 6% higher price and 1% impact from portfolio. 30% earnings growth, coupled with industry-leading sales performance, translated into 19% PTOI margins for the segment. The combination of our global infrastructure and the businesses' ability to respond and win in every major market with an intense focus on the customer, demonstrate the power of our business model. This discipline of service and momentum of innovation are the foundation for growth in 2012 and beyond. ","Taking a closer look within the segment, seed fourth quarter sales of $621 million increased 7% based on the close of an exceptional Latin America summer season. Latin America's sales in the second half were up more than 40%, driven by over 55% growth in Brazil's summer corn sales excluding currency, as our L.A. teams mobilized quickly and responded well to the increase in corn hectares. The quarter also captured improved sales in the Philippines and Indonesia, reflecting improved weather conditions and increased planting acres, with our teams capturing more than their share of that increase. ","For the full year 2011, the Pioneer global team delivered another year of market wins, with growing sales, earnings and margin. The incremental contribution was well-balanced between North America and international growth as we predicted coming into 2011. Success was underpinned by new product penetration, increased acreage and share gains in North America, volume growth and value capture in Latin America and success growing in Europe and Asia. Specifically, 2011 seed sales were up 17% to $6.3 billion, reflecting both volume and price contributions. ","In summary, the business delivered on all commitments, including its focus on investing for future growth, ending an outstanding year with the business stronger than ever. And importantly, here's an update on North America. The sales teams have been setting a historic pace as we work closely with customers during a very dynamic cycle. Our order book is ahead of last year, with our volumes tracking in line with growth objectives and the value proposition aligned with customer expectations. At the product level, our newest integrated and reduced refuge product offerings are being embraced. And confidence in our soybean performance and confidence in our soybean performance and disease packages are strong. Specifically, we anticipate about 60% of our triples will be converted to AcreMax 1 or AcreMax XTRA. In addition, we're releasing many new hybrids with our AQUAmax technology. ","In soybeans, we have over 30 new varieties and about 60 new products from the last 2 years penetrating our lineup. And one final comment as we look forward to 2012, we anticipate AcreMax Extreme regulatory approval in the first half and will be testing this product this season, allowing thousands of farmers to see it in their local fields.","Turning to crop protection products. Sales for the quarter of $676 million grew 9%, reflecting growth across all major product lines in most regions, with the largest contribution for the quarter coming from strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America. All regions achieved double-digit sales growth in the second half, led by the excellent performance in the Latin American market. Importantly, these strong results reflect volume growth and net price gains. ","For the full year 2011, crop protection sales of $2.9 billion grew 16%, including a 3% decline from divested businesses. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr insecticide, which posted sales of about $580 million, growing over 45% in its fourth season with continued market share gains.","Our 2011 successes are many, including an insect control portfolio exceeding $1 billion in sales, continued growth of decosystrobe [ph] and fungicide, and the introduction of new proprietary herbicide blends for expanded weed control options for our customers. We continue to refresh and renew our crop protection portfolio by divesting older chemistries while accelerating our R&D pipeline advancements and new product launches. ","This team continues to execute well with their strategy, which centers on market-driven innovation and game-changing new products. Looking ahead to the first half of 2012 for the Agriculture segment, we expect to increase sales moderately, with mid-single-digit earnings growth. Our assumptions center on strong operating performance in the businesses, delivering both volume growth and pricing gains, offset in part by the transient impacts of input cost increases, continued growth investments and, most notably, significant currency headwinds. The split between quarters hinges on the northern hemisphere season favoring March or April, and currently, that's hard to call. We assume growth investments and, more importantly, currency headwind will be more heavily weighted to the first quarter. ","Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $630 million declined 18% compared to the same period last year, with 33% lower volume offset by 15% higher prices, essentially metals pass-through. Pretax earnings of $42 million were $56 million lower than the same period last year due to inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in consumer electronics and plasma displays. Also included in this quarter's earnings is $20 million of licensing income from our partner in the development of advanced OLEDs.","As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chains. We believe these excess inventory levels will continue through the first half of 2012. We expect PV installations to grow at 10% this year, with a rebound in demand during the second half of the year. ","For first quarter, E&C sales and earnings are expected to be substantially lower than prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and softness in consumer electronics and strong first quarter comps. Excluding the fourth quarter licensing income, we expect segment PTOI to be up sequentially. ","Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $289 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's enzyme business and DuPont's commercial biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed, with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including $6 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. For the first quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be in line with fourth quarter results. We continue to see good growth across these product lines and anticipate PTOI margin expansion for the full year.","Moving to Slide 11 in our Nutrition & Health segment. Sales of $806 million grew 138%, with the acquisition impact from the Danisco specialty food ingredients business. Earnings of $52 million reflected sales more than offsetting integration costs and includes $20 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. In Solae, specialty soy products increased volume and price with the continued penetration into health-related products. Sales growth in specialty was offset by lower soy crushed feed sales, in line with the business objective to shift mix to higher value offerings. Earnings growth reflected a positive mix shift and productivity improvements.","The acquired businesses of health and protection and enablers grew, on a pro forma basis, about 4%, as pricing gains were offset in part by lower volumes due to destocking.","Moving to the outlook. The segment is on track for the full benefit of planned cost synergies to positively contribute to 2012 performance. The benefit will mount throughout the year, reflecting the implementation schedule. Specifically, for the first quarter, we expect sales of the combined segment in the range of $800 million to $850 million, with portfolio impact as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth on higher sales and cost synergies, coupled with the sales improvements, will reflect sequential improvement in margins in the range of mid- to high-single digits, inclusive of amortization.","Now on Slide 12, Performance Chemicals. Sales of $1.9 billion increased 12%, primarily due to higher selling prices. Both businesses in this segment demonstrated double-digit sales increases overall, with the most strength from North America. As we shared last quarter, TiO2 markets paused with fiscal tightening in China and Eurozone concerns, leading to substantial short-term demand decline and destocking in the value chains. Even with this expected softness, the segment delivered PTOI of $433 million, a 37% increase versus last year due to enhanced pricing in TiO2 and fluoropolymers and continued emphasis on fixed cost productivity.","For 2012, we expect global demand growth and see signs of strengthening, first in North American markets. Leading indicators point to an improving TiO2 outlook, with North American order patterns consistent with recovery to a more typical seasonal demand profile across 2 quarters.","Additionally, fluoropolymers demand remains strong. As a result, first quarter sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI up substantially. With 8 decades experience in this industry, our confidence in TiO2 demand fundamentals remains intact, and we are proceeding with the TiO2 capacity expansion as announced.","Now let's turn to Slide 13 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 8% on 10% stronger pricing, offsetting 2% lower volume. The segment had price increases in all of its major market segments to offset the higher cost of raw materials. Auto builds were flat to down in all regions except North America, where builds were up 17%. And there was strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. ","PTOI of $58 million decreased $13 million, primarily due to mix impact and a $7 million settlement. For the first quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year, with earnings up significantly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 2% in the first quarter, with full year builds expected to be up about 4% globally. This segment is driving actions in all product lines to offset higher raw material costs, with continued productivity to improve margins.","Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14. Sales were up 1% based on 14% selling price increase, offsetting a destocking-led drop in volume. While underlying automotive markets were growing, value-chain destocking was most evident in Europe and appeared to finish in North America. Electronics was soft while packaging markets were stable. ","Absent the one-time $31 million benefit last year, PTOI was down $24 million or about 14% on lower volume. For the first quarter, we expect sales down modestly as price increases essentially mitigate softer volume and PTOI down substantially on volumes, driven mostly by a weaker Europe and conservative channel inventory management. Global auto builds are expected to grow at 2% and packaging demand remain stable. ","On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 10% on a combination of pricing and portfolio change, partially offset by 2% lower volume. Sales grew in all regions, led by Asia Pacific at 22%. PTOI was $94 million, essentially flat versus last year as portfolio change and selling price offset softer volumes and higher raw material costs. Additionally, the prior year included a net charge of $11 million for one-time items.","For the first quarter, market fundamentals remain noisy for our advanced material offerings, with some improvement in North American demand and continued growth in Latin America. We see improvement in law enforcement and fiberoptic cable markets, as our Kevlar XP and Kevlar AP continue to be well received in the market. Our consulting and CleanTech offerings continue to see moderate demand up globally. Overall, sales are expected to be up modestly and PTOI down moderately. ","And now, I'll turn the call back to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen. So as we look ahead to 2012, we expect modest sales growth and reaffirmed our earnings outlook for 7% to 12% growth. After a challenging fourth quarter, we anticipate conditions will improve in many of our industrial businesses as the year plays out. ","Our growth outlook varies by region and by business. We see Asia demand recovering from the slowdown we saw on the fourth quarter. We continue to expect slow, sequential recovery in the U.S. and weak demand in many European markets. We're poised for a very strong year ahead in Agriculture. Our order books for seeds is at a historic pace, it's ahead of last year and consistent with our expectations for strong underlying growth. In crop protection, product expansions will contribute to 2012 results. ","We have an important milestone with the initial launch of Cyazypyr in the second half, which, over time, when coupled with Rynaxypyr, we expect to hit $1 billion in sales. With respect to TiO2, we expect markets to tighten by midyear, with the North American economy supporting a coating season comparable to last year, along with restocking of the value chain in Asia. For the full year, we expect TiO2 sales volume to meet or exceed 2011 levels. ","Our expectation for company volume in the first quarter are cautious. We expect volumes for many of our industrial businesses to be up sequentially versus the fourth quarter but down year-over-year against strong comps in the first quarter of 2011.  At this point, many of our supply chain inventories are low, and we expect demand to pick up slowly, starting late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. ","One exception where destocking continues in the first quarter is photovoltaics. We're seeing some positive signs that production will pick up again by midyear and expect PV installations to grow about 10% this year. ","At today's exchange rates, currency will be a headwind for our businesses, and Nick mentioned this. We have the entire year ahead of us to manage contingency to compensate. ","We'll continue to be disciplined in our execution, whether it's in the advancement of one of our R&D pipelines, a customer collaboration at one of our innovation centers or a productivity initiative. We are well positioned for recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint. And we look ahead with confidence in our ability to execute well and deliver growth in 2012. ","Karen, back to you.","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay, John. Let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, could you give a little bit more detail on your views on end-market trends for 2012, particularly for construction-related end markets, perhaps breaking it down by region?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, construction was a disappointment in '11, being about flat with 2010 from a start standpoint, so -- I'm talking U.S., initially. So we're -- although if you talk to people in the marketplace, they'll tell you that the starts are going to grow this year in the U.S. maybe about 10%. I'm being very cautious about that. So I don't see very big changes from a U.S. standpoint. If you really take a look at Europe, commercial has been holding up a little bit there, but that really has -- is offering, really, no great hope in 2012. We do believe there'll be a rebound in infrastructure investment in Asia, so we'll see some positive signs out of Asia. But by and large, as I add up the world, we're not expecting much of a volume increase from construction for 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","Alina Khaykin ","This is actually Alina Khaykin in for John. Just a quick question on pharma. You saw a big pickup sequentially in earnings. How should we think about that business for 2012?","Ellen J. Kullman","Nick, you want to take pharma?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Sure. So as you mentioned, pharma was at about $290 million for the year. In 2012, we're anticipating pharma to contribute about $50 million of pretax earnings. When you think about what's going on from the patent side, Japan comes off in December -- came off December in 2011. And that's nearly half of the pharma impact that we saw this year. So you can see the reason for the decline going down to $50 million is because of Japan that came off in December. And Canada's going to be coming off this month. So between the 2 of those, that's the primary reason for going down to the $50 million we anticipate in '12.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a 2-part question. Ellen, when you describe TiO2, sometimes you say it's a commodity business and sometimes, the profitability is good and sometimes the profitability is bad, and that's the way it always is. Yet, your TiO2 expansion is probably your largest capital project. So can you explain why you expect to get very good returns on capital from that investment when you describe it as a quality business -- as a commodity business? And then secondly, can you talk about pricing in photovoltaics, excluding metals pass-through?","Ellen J. Kullman","Sure. The first part of the question, I would maybe upgrade your language, Jeff. I would suggest that it's a good business at the depth of it, and it's a fantastic business at the peak. And over the cycle, we get very strong segment returns for this business. And that's driven by our competitive advantage from our manufacturing process technology. And as you see, it isn't just a great cash generator for us. So when you have a pure cyclical commodity and at the depths of the cycle, you're still making a great return for the company, it is worthy of investment. And so that's where it hits. The other thing is we haven't put a new line, a major line into that business. The last one that opened up was in Kuan Yin in Taiwan, and that was 1994, maybe. And so it's been a while and -- from that standpoint. On PV, we've seen, obviously, the metal pass-through. If you take that away, it's all about the efficiency of the cell and what it delivers. We were seeing PV module prices come down as commensurate with the increases in efficiency in the modules themselves. And that's when you saw some of the support from some of the governments kind of go away. The economics largely remain the same. The margins are holding. And I do believe it's because things like army Solamet paste, which offers higher efficiency, enables that equation to work.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gulley from Ticonderoga.","Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","You had a great year in Latin America this year given the higher planted acres and good trends, but how do you think growers are going to react to the drought conditions that they're experiencing as they approach harvest? How will that affect your results the next growing season?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, thank you for the recognition of the great season that we had last year, especially in Latin America, where we made great progress. Are you talking about North America planting, Mark, or are you talking about Latin America? Oh, you're talking about the drought. Must be Latin America then because you're silent. I think that we've seen great penetration with -- especially in Brazil corn. Depending on what they have, obviously, our product position will adjust accordingly. And I think if you look at North American planting, they're going to take that into consideration. We have the new AQUAmax technology out in 2012. We're very excited about what that means. It looks like it's about a 5-bushel per unit positive on the impact. So we're very excited about that. But the current corn soy prices these days does favor corn. So there's a lot that's going on in the marketplace and a lot to take into account. With our product portfolio, that Right Product, Right Acre and what we've done, I think that if there is drought in the region, we'll be able to handle it.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ellen, on TiO2, you mentioned volume as being flat to up this year. What are your expectations for pricing and, more importantly, earnings? Will it be up year-over-year, flat or down?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think that we're going to see, sequentially, improvements in volume, led by North America. I think the fundamentals there will speak to a environment that will allow us to continue some of the momentum we've seen, maybe go sideways a little bit. But I don't think that there's going to be a negative repercussion there. So Investor Day, we talked about Performance Chemicals margins, near-term projected at 22% to 24%. Maybe in '12, they'll be flat between that volume and price trade-off. But I think it will depend on how the year plays out. As lunar new year completes and Asia gets back to work in a few weeks, I think we're going to see a lot about what's going to happen, not only in TiO2 but in other industries as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ellen, I thought I heard you say -- or maybe it was Karen in the prepared remarks -- mid-single digit earnings growth in ag. I guess that seems a little below your trend line targets, and I would guess acres are up, your new products are up, prices are up. So why isn't the growth a little bit more robust?","Ellen J. Kullman","I think if you take a look at the current currency projections, especially in the first half of the year where we do a majority of our business, that that's entirely reflective of that currency -- our operating, if you look at a local currency basis, our operating results are going to be absolutely solid. So we'll be sharing more on that as we go out, but we wanted to give you the current look. Volume's going to be up, price is going to be up, currency is going to be a headwind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Ellen, a question on Latin America, where you had very strong growth. Last year, in Latin -- 2010, Latin America was 17% of your sales. Just wondering what that grew to this year, what percentage it is of your PTOI and, more importantly, what did it contribute to growth and how do you see that going forward?","Ellen J. Kullman","Boy, we did have a tremendous run in Latin America. If you look at our seed business, our market shares, 2010 season was 27%, and while the hectares are fine, we're positive that we're going to see some growth there. But we'll wait until the hectares come in to really -- to look at that. Latin America itself, ag was up 40%, and our total sales for the company were up 17%. So you can see the real impact that Agriculture has had on Latin America. So we're very bullish on it. I think, really, exporting our Right Product, Right Acre or hectare strategy to Latin America, I think getting very close to the customers down there has been a huge benefit in our penetration. We've seen it in Brazil, we've seen it in Argentina, and I think we'll continue to -- Latin America will continue to be a very important sector for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays Capital.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to go back to the guidance for this year kind of relative to what you originally thought, you talked about $0.17 of headwind. Has there actually been stuff since that original guidance that has been a tailwind for you? And then how should we think about share count and the pension effect within that guidance for this year?","Ellen J. Kullman","Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","So a lot of things are moving, and that's why I say even with those headwinds that we talked about, Duffy, it'd be too soon in the year to make any kind of a change in our guidance on our outlook. So that's why we're reaffirming. When you think about the pension piece, we had talked to you about $250 million of headwinds year-over-year in 2012 versus that in '11. That's going to be about where it's coming out, maybe just slightly better than that. But on a cents per share basis, it's going to hold about the same. On a dilution basis, on an EPS basis, number of shares, I think the work we've been doing in that area is pretty evident in the fourth quarter. We bought back $0.25 million first quarter of '11, we bought back another $0.25 million in the third quarter. Another quarter -- so if you look over a period of time there, we brought -- bought back close to $1 billion worth of shares, which is looking to control the dilution over that 18-month period. And we'll continue to -- that practice as we go forward. As you know, we have plans in place that have already been authorized by the board, $2 billion in the newest, which was authorized in 2011, and we still have $100 million from the prior plan available to us. So we'll continue to do buybacks to deal with dilution from a compensation perspective that might occur.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Cash from UBS.","Andrew W. Cash - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, just a couple of quick questions here. First of all, in corn seed, what is your expectation for the cost of producing corn seed in 2012 versus what it was in 2011? And then secondly, back over to TiO2, Ellen, it sounds like you're looking forward to sort of a flat gross profit margin in TiO2. I'm just curious if you're getting any pushback on some of your price increases for the first quarter.","Ellen J. Kullman","Nick, why don't you take the input cost of that question?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Sure. So Andy, when you look at input costs on ag and you look at the fact that the commodity market and the dynamics that we've seen there, the '11 cost impact on '12 sales is going to be there. It's going to be a higher cost for us. Couple that with weather problems that occurred in 2011, again, that would impact 2012 costs. However, the work we do around the innovation, the value we're bringing to the marketplace, we believe, will allow us to maintain our plan and the growth that we're projecting from an earnings perspective. And so we feel very confident around our pricing capabilities relation to that increase in cost that we're anticipating in 2012.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, on TiO2, the market fundamentals are supportive in the environment. We don't normally talk about price payment, but I'll just give you an example, though, of the mood in the marketplace, is that customers who historically only purchase on a quarterly basis are now looking for long-term relationships and security of supply. And I think that in itself gives -- reinforces the market fundamentals that I've been talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of quick questions on Asia. Your volume pressure there was more pronounced than it was in Europe and the U.S. Was destocking more acute in Asia in your judgment? And then looking ahead to 1Q, I recognize it's sometimes difficult with Chinese new year, but would you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of your order books across your key product lines to start the year in Asia?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. If you take a look at Asia Pacific, it's really a tale of what we've been seeing in Electronics & Communications and in TiO2 and polymers. So, I mean, those 3 businesses really saw tremendous destocking in the fourth quarter, and we've talked about that. Ag & Nutrition & Health continued to have very strong quarters in Asia Pacific. And we're -- we, like everyone else, are kind of waiting to see what happens after the Chinese new year, which started yesterday, I guess. Sequentially, if you take a look at GDP in China, for instance, it's gone from 9% to 8%, 8% still pretty good if you look around the world. If you look at auto builds in 2012, they're going to have a slow start to the year, probably down in the first quarter, but all in all, auto builds for the year in China are going to be up 7%. And then -- so we do see that it's going to probably, because of the lunar new year, because of the uncertainty in the supply chain -- we're starting with very little inventory, though, in most of these areas. And so I think that bodes well to an improving picture, but sequentially, I think you'll see that play out month-by-month.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Mike J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just back on Agriculture purchases. My question is around can we get some sort of qualitative review of the extent of the prepays that we'll see in the first half of '12? And I guess in -- some of the growers we've spoken to in both Brazil and North America have mentioned seed charges in the U.S. It seems like that might be more noise than anything else, isolated to a few newer lead hybrids. But in Brazil, we've heard that some growers have had to buy seed from Pioneer's competitors just to get the summer crop in the ground. And I was wondering if this is an artifact of whether -- or where products are in the launch cycle, pricing, maybe pricing would be a little more aggressive or some other factor.","Ellen J. Kullman","So our order book's ahead of last year, and it's really aligned with our growth targets, prepays versus whatever, I don't have that breakdown. But I think it's been really -- the best predicter that we have of the season is that order book, and it's full. In Brazil, our corn sales were up 55%, x currency. So we had a very, very strong season. So whether some people maybe -- I don't know. But we had a phenomenally strong season, a tremendous position there. So we here -- I don't think we have any issues with supply. We've gone out. Our direct-to-farmer model enables us to be very specific with what the needs are. And Nick talked about the winter production and things like that we're doing to assure that we have adequate supply. So we think that the season will work through just great.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So when you guided down on December 9, it seemed like the big reason was destocking. But as we look at the results, it doesn't feel like destocking hurt you as much in the quarter and that it's mostly stuff like taxes. I'm just curious if you think that's fair and how the last 3 weeks of December actually played out versus your own expectations.","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, I think that part of -- I did think it was destocking in markets. If you look at our volume number alone, down 10%, that was what changed appreciably from when we talked about -- talked to you at the end of the third quarter to the December timeframe, so -- but it wasn't macros. I mean, our economist will tell you that the GDP growth is there, but the supply chains are destocking. It's -- conservatism just reigned. And so we came out in December, gave you the best knowledge of what we thought would happen. Yes, tax certainly was an issue, but we understood that. We understood that we got the R&D credit, 100% of it in the fourth quarter in '10, and we've been accruing that all year in 2011. So the mix of business was a little different, so maybe that was a couple of cents off from a tax rate impact. But all in all, I would suggest the reason we did come out and talk to you in December was volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","Karen A. Fletcher","John, I think -- why don't we just take one more question?","Operator","Our last question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Six weeks ago, you guys were talking about the full year outlook for 2012, and you were looking at auto builds to be up 6%. And then in the presentation today, you're looking at auto builds to be up 4%. I'm wondering if you can talk about where geographically -- or why that change was made. It seems like a rather large change. And then on the topic of autos, I was wondering if you could offer any comments with respect to where Performance Coatings -- where you think Performance Coatings fits into your portfolio in the future?","Ellen J. Kullman","So global builds were reduced from 6% to 4% in the last 6 weeks. A lot of that came out of Europe, where Europe is expected to -- build to be down 8% for the year and down even more than that in the first quarter, down 11% in the first quarter. And so, yes, there a little bit of changes, but I think the majority of the impact was really the outlook around Europe. And China was down maybe, I don't know, 8%, 9% to 7%, but it's still noisy. And this is all third-party data, and they update it monthly. And we've looked at that versus our book of business, so. Second question was around coatings. I think that they finished the year well. Our pricing in terms of the products that we're delivering and the differentiation, the pricing was well seen. We had a little volume decline in the fourth quarter based on some refinish destocking that we've seen. But all in all, I think they had a solid year. Their productivity plans continue to deliver on those, and I think that they're in an improving environment. So they're gaining some momentum.","So thank you, all. Great to talk to you today, and we look forward to catching up with you soon.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lori Koch. Please go ahead.","Lori Koch","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for DuPont's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted to the Investors section of DuPont's website and through the link to our webcast.","Joining me on the call today are Marc Doyle, Chief Executive Officer; Jean Desmond, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Breen, Executive Chair.","Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our second quarter Form 10-Q as may be modified by our subsequent periodic and current reports includes a detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our press release and posted on the Investors section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Doyle","Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 2, we delivered organic sales and adjusted EPS in line with our expectations by staying focused on our competitive strengths and the earnings drivers within our control. Although, our operating EBITDA was slightly below our forecast, primarily due to unanticipated currency headwinds we were able to maintain gross margins and continued to expand our EBITDA margins even as the U.S. dollar strengthened and several of our key end markets remained challenged.","We enabled this performance through continued price improvement, driving our synergy savings and advancing our restructuring program. Combined these actions delivered an additional $145 million of savings this quarter and we are on track to deliver greater than $500 million for the full year. Our team is laser-focused on these priority initiatives as we continue to navigate the macro uncertainties.","Turning to slide 3, our volumes continued to be impacted by the slowdown in both the automotive and semiconductor end markets, that is also affecting many of our peers. However, there are still many exciting areas within our portfolio such as water and pharma that continue to post strong results. All in, global sales of $5.4 billion were in line with expectations at down about 2% on an organic basis. Organic sales in our core segments were down about 1.5%. As noted, while we are seeing continued weakness in a few end markets, there are many bright spots in our portfolio that are performing very well. Highlights here are aerospace in T&I and S&C, pharma and plant-based foods in N&B, water in S&C and premium smartphones in E&I, which in total account for approximately 15% of our sales and were up 7% in aggregate versus the prior year.","In smartphones a market that continues to face challenges, our ability to deliver higher content in the newer models enabled our Interconnect Solutions business to deliver 8% higher revenue in the quarter versus prior year, a marked improvement from the first half when sales were down 10%. This outcome demonstrates the value of our innovation engine and the power of our close customer relationships. Our reputation for working closely with our customers to deliver the technology they require sets us apart and enables us to drive pricing and demand in a rapidly changing market like smartphones.","Our more sluggish markets of automotive and semiconductor are experiencing negative growth year-over-year. These areas, which account for a little more than 20% of our portfolio, were down 11% and 3% respectively. We believe destocking in semiconductors is now behind us and we're starting to see indications of stabilization in automotive channel inventories. I am confident our businesses will ultimately outperform, driven by their strong position and broad technology portfolios to address key trends such as hybrid and electric vehicles and the transition to 5G and enabling the Internet of Things.","Regionally organic sales were flat in the U.S. and Canada, down 3% in EMEA, down 4% in Asia Pacific and down 4% in Latin America. Weakened automotive end markets continued to drive the declines in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. However, total sales in China, the market which turned down sharply for us last December, posted its strongest results this year and were down year-over-year in the quarter by 2% versus down 10% in Q1 and 3% in Q2, each versus the same period last year, definitely an improving trend for us.","Turning to Slide 4. Adjusted EPS was up 2% on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. As noted, currency was a headwind in the quarter, reducing EPS by $0.03. Our segment results excluding the impact of currency were a net $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS, while depreciation and amortization and a lower share count both contributed to our EPS growth.","To provide a little more color on our segment results, I'll cover some of the key operating EBITDA drivers. Operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion was down 4% versus the prior year period. We again delivered operating leverage, further demonstrating our ability to drive price and operating efficiencies amid challenging market conditions. We delivered operating EBITDA margin improvement of 20 basis points versus the prior year.","Our strong price and cost discipline was partially offset by a weaker mix with volumes in our higher-margin businesses, primarily Semiconductor Technologies, posting softer results in the quarter. We also experienced higher manufacturing costs, driven by planned maintenance activity, primarily in the Safety & Construction segment, as well as lower production rates, driven by weakened volumes in our T&I and Non-Core segments.","Before I turn the call over to Jean to discuss the quarter in further detail, I'll cover our full year guidance on Slide 5. For the full year, our expectation for organic sales remains unchanged at slightly down. Our forecast for total annual sales, including the impact of currency and portfolio is about $21.5 billion.","We are narrowing our adjusted EPS range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share to $3.77 to $3.82 per share, maintaining the midpoint of the prior guidance. This adjustment reflects second half currency headwinds of approximately $45 million versus our original expectations. In the appendix, we provide segment-level commentary as well as some additional modeling guidance.","Overall, I am confident in our ability to adapt as market conditions evolve, while continuing to make smart, high-return investments to enhance our portfolio. Our relentless attention to cost and pricing discipline, coupled with the benefits of our ongoing investments in innovation will deliver bottom line growth when market conditions improve. Our focus on driving improvements in ROIC is the right mindset for the long-term strength of the company and every part of the organization is committed. We are working all the levers in our control to deliver on our earnings commitments and drive shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Jean to discuss the segment results.","Jean Desmond","Thanks, Marc. Starting with Electronics & Imaging on Slide 6, net sales of $934 million and operating EBITDA of $320 million were in line with our expectations and demonstrates that the second half improvement we have been forecasting got off to a solid start in the third quarter. Sales in China for this segment were up nearly 30% versus the year-ago period, reflecting a second straight quarter of sales growth. This result was partially enabled by higher content in the next-generation smartphone.","Our Semiconductor Technology business was down low single-digits versus the year-ago period, but was up mid-single-digits versus the second quarter. We believe, this sequential improvement indicates that the softness we saw in Semiconductor Technologies in the second quarter due to high channel inventory is resolving. And our current expectation is that the semiconductor market recovery will continue returning to growth during 2020.","Operating EBITDA margins for the segment were flat at 34%. Softer volumes in Semiconductor Technologies our highest-margin business was a headwind to segment margins. This headwind was offset by a gain associated with a planned asset sale.","Moving to Nutrition & Biosciences on Slide 7. Momentum in our Nutrition & Biosciences segment continued with another quarter of organic sales growth. The strength of our N&B portfolio is its breadth, which enabled low single-digit organic growth amid well-documented near-term market-driven softness in biorefineries and probiotics. Third quarter organic growth was led by Food & Beverage volume gain, which were driven by strength in specialty proteins and cellulosics from growing demand in plant based meats.","Other highlights included high single-digit organic growth in Pharma Solutions, as well as strength in the food enzyme and animal nutrition business within Health & Biosciences.","We continue to be a market leader in probiotics and remain confident in the long-term growth of this business. We expect that probiotics growth will continue to be fueled from Asia Pacific where current market penetration is low as compared to other regions but growing steadily. September year-to-date probiotics in Asia-Pacific has grown double digits. Operating EBITDA margins in Nutrition & Biosciences are essentially flat with the prior year.","Transportation & Industrial recorded net sales of $1.2 billion, down 10% on an organic basis with a 1% price improvement more than offset by an 11% volume decline. Our results reflect continued demand softness and destocking in the global automotive market and weak electronic volume.","While global auto build remained relatively steady with last quarter from a year-over-year perspective, inventory destocking continued to negatively impact our results. We are pleased that we maintained pricing strength in the quarter versus the prior year, but anticipate that the rebalancing of the nylon 6,6 supply chain will influence pricing and volume as we look to the remainder of the year.","Operating EBITDA declined 20% versus the prior year-ago period with pricing gains and cost reductions more than offset by the impacts from lower volumes and currency headwinds.","Turning to the results of Safety & Construction on slide 9. Net sales of $1.3 billion were up 2% on an organic basis. Operating EBITDA of $352 million was up 1%. Continued pricing strength and productivity action drove operating EBITDA margins up 80 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, operating EBITDA margins are up 370 basis points.","Our top line results were consistent with the second quarter. We realized pricing gains across all businesses, which is now our seventh consecutive quarter of pricing gain in S&C.","Likewise strength in Water Solutions where we continue to see strong demand in industrial and wastewater treatment markets was offset by softness in North American construction end market.","Demand for our Safety Solutions segment remains robust but was negatively impacted by planned maintenance activity as well as outages at some of our key raw material suppliers causing us to have to curtail aramid production. S&C continues to improve their cost structure and has raised their operating EBITDA margins above the company average. A commitment to value in use pricing and a relentless focus on productivity is driving EBITDA margin improvement.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10. You'll see that our net debt has remained relatively consistent at $15.5 billion with slightly higher commercial paper balances, which we expect to reduce by year end, offset by higher cash balances as of September 30th.","As I've said before, our capital structure has been in place for several quarters now and we feel good about our position. It provides us with the flexibility we need while maintaining our investment-grade rating.","You can also see the improvement we have driven in working capital in the quarter. Both accounts receivable and inventories are down as compared to June 30th, providing a working capital benefit. This is slightly offset by lower accounts payable balances.","Capitalizing on our working capital opportunity remains a focus area for us. Our working capital levels did rise coming out of separation, but I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and expect additional improvement in this area. The gains from working capital improvement and well-controlled capital spending enabled us to exceed our free cash flow conversion target of greater than 90% for the quarter.","We also made additional progress on our share buyback program. Repurchases now totaled $600 million since June 1st and you can anticipate a similar pace through the end of the year. To date, we've returned greater than $800 million to shareholders.","Let me close with a few comments on ROIC. We remain on track to deliver meaningful ROIC improvement as the portfolio came together. More importantly, however, is the mindset shift of the organization, which is now returns-focused. Our major capital and R&D spending is appropriately derisked. Our teams understand the importance of ensuring these dollars strengthen the bottom line and improve ROIC.","I'll now turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Breen","Thanks Jean. I continue to be impressed by our team's ability to advance its strategic priorities in tough market conditions. They have stayed relentlessly focused on execution and it is visible in our results. At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are well aware of the value creation potential inherent in this portfolio. We are actively pursuing strategic portfolio transactions that will drive increased shareholder returns and sustainable long-term growth.","We also continue to refine the portfolio even as we assess more significant portfolio reconfiguration. This past quarter, we completed the sale of the Sustainable Solutions business from the Non-Core segment, and in Q2, we completed the sale of the Natural Colors business from N&B. Both divestments had lower margin profiles than their segment and the total company average.","Additionally, we announced the planned divestment of the silk and carbide business in E&I for $450 million in cash. Once we close, we will use the net proceeds in a way which further enhances shareholder value. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize our Non-Core businesses, and we plan to make significant progress over the coming quarters.","We are also looking for bolt-on acquisitions targets to further strengthen our high growth industry-leading businesses. Recently, we announced the intention to make two strategic acquisitions in our Water Solutions business, an area of significant growth opportunity.","By enhancing our capabilities in ultrafiltration, we are building on an already strong position with additional capabilities and value-added solutions that will drive top line growth. Water is a vital end market driven by significant demand trends and our portfolio is advantaged in the space as evidenced by our 6% organic growth during Q3. Overall, we are focused on both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.","Before we turn to Q&A, I want to address a couple of areas that I know are on your mind: The PFAS litigation and the Chemours suit. PFAS is a broad term that covers a variety of substances including PFOA and PFOS. For your information, the firefighting foam tuts relate largely to PFOS, a chemical that the Chemours and we including historical DuPont never made.","The same is true for firefighting foam. As to the PFAS matters themselves, we feel these liabilities are well-managed and we have every confidence in our position. As a testament to that, we have passed the second year of a five-year sharing agreement with Chemours and we still have paid $0 to them.","As to the Chemours suit, the spin-off of heritage DuPont's performance chemicals business into Chemours complied with all applicable legal requirements and followed standard practices relating to such transactions and we are confident in our position.","Earlier this month, Chemours filed a response which implied that the historical DuPont Board did not intend for Chemours indemnification liability to be uncapped. This is simply wrong. The materials reviewed with the historic DuPont Board and the June 15 meeting at which the spin was unanimously approved clearly and unequivocally state that the indemnification liabilities are uncapped.","In addition to the board materials, there are numerous other documents which clearly show that the liabilities are uncapped. Furthermore, Chemours itself reaffirmed the Separation Agreement as part of the 2017 amendment, which undoubtedly states the liabilities were to be uncapped.","As you know, Corteva and DuPont jointly filed a motion to dismiss the complaints, because this matter belongs in arbitration as provided in the Chemours Separation Agreement. We will file our final response in early November after which the court will respond to our request for dismissal. If there are additional questions on this, we can discuss these further during the Q&A section of the call.","In closing, our results illustrate our commitment to our key principles: the fundamental value of deep customer relationships, ongoing investments in innovation and optimizing the efficiency of the organization. The team continues to stay laser-focused on executing against these priorities to deliver increased value to our shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to Lori to open up the Q&A.","Lori Koch","Thank you, Ed. With that let's move on to your question. First, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you good morning everyone. Thanks for the comments on the broader portfolio and the like. Also I was just curious that in addition to what you've identified as Non-Core right, you've got kind a number of things that are still sitting in the segments and kind of coming out and without identifying businesses perhaps.","But can you give us a sense of, how much revenue might actually be sitting in the four segments as kind of, \"ongoing business\" that really hasn't met that threshold in your view?","Ed Breen","Jeff, it's very small. We did sell a business you saw recently that had not been in Non-Core. We got a nice price for it, it wasn't as strategic to us. There's a couple of more things like that. But generally speaking, Marc, Jean and the team are really focused on moving out the Non-Core. Every one of them is in motion.","You've seen we've made a few announcements already, but every one of them is actively being worked at this time. So that's the heavier lift is to get that done and get the cash in, so we can redeploy it smartly for our shareholders. And then just to reiterate your opening comment there. Obviously, the team is extremely busy on looking at some transformational moves. And I would just say, we're in 7-day a week work mode right now if I could say it that way and really looking at that heavily to move a couple of things.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone. Maybe if we could just get a little more detail in the electronics piece particularly as it relates to smartphones and the good sell-in you've been seeing. How much of that is really related to just there's more content of your products in the phones versus there has to be sort of an inventory load of these phones or maybe greater production to build into the channel?","So I guess what I'm asking is, how long and how sustainable is this strong sales trend? And ultimately do you have a difficult comparison against it?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Thanks Vincent. This is Marc. I'll take that one. You're right. It's a combination of builds for the new phones and the higher content in the new phones that's driving the kind of half-over-half sales increase most of which hits our ICS segment, Interconnect Solutions in E&I.","And we view that -- so what's really happening here is, as the phones start to become more 5G-enabled, there are more high-frequency materials inside including antennas that pick up the signals. And we have a number of products that go into there including some next-generation Kapton-based laminate materials.","And that's expected to continue to grow through 2020, 2021 as more and more of the new phone models have these antennas and these higher-frequency capabilities. And so, while it's a nice growth driver in the second half of this year we do expect it to continue for several years.","And just to bring it back to the new Kapton line, we announced a couple of quarters ago that new Kapton production line, the demand there is largely driven by these trends in 5G for next-gen handsets.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Christopher Parkinson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","On the outlook for N&B in 2021, there's just been some recent volatility in quarters due to market-based factors as well as some facility downtime in pharma. Can you just refresh our memory on your general growth expectations for the components of the N&B portfolio? Specifically probiotics, specialty proteins and Pharma Solutions, as well as any key macro variables driving each substrate? Just trying to get a sense of the normalized outlook from both a growth as well as mix margin perspective? Thank you.","Marc Doyle","Yes. Chris this is Marc. I'll take that one too. So as you said there are some good midterm growth drivers here in N&B and you highlighted a few of the key ones. We continue to have a lot of confidence in the probiotics market as a long-term double-digit growth market. It's driven by new health indications, new products, as well as just the continued penetration of probiotic usage into the nutritional supplements market.","Asia is a huge growth driver for probiotics consumption, growing double-digits. So we like those long-term dynamics.","You also mentioned specialty proteins. The whole space around plant-based foods, which is -- or plant-based meats, which is relatively small today from a specialty food ingredient sales standpoint for us less than $100 million, we think that that's got a good long-term double-digit growth trajectory too. And then you mentioned pharma excipients. And certainly the pharma space is a nice kind of mid single-digit growth space. So those dynamics are still very solid. They're great long-term growth, secular growth drivers for N&B. I'd also mention these are higher-margin parts of the N&B portfolio. So as they grow, we'll continue to see an uplift on our margins.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi, Good morning.","Ed Breen","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","I'm glad to be calling in on my first call here.","Ed Breen","That's right.","Scott Davis","I got several questions I can get away with it for a while as the new guy. Ed, I'm kind of intrigued by your comments on trying to drive this Chemours thing into arbitration. But can you really -- can you talk to us about what you think the timing is? If there is two potential outcomes here, you're going to get an outcome that drove it into arbitration. Is that something that can happen in the next 12 months? Or does this all kind of grind to a halt just with the legal system and its delays it should inevitably have?","Ed Breen","Yes. Scott, I think having been through some of these before and certainly talking with our counsel on this, if it goes to arbitration, which is clearly what the documents say I think it resolves itself much quicker, because that process is just a faster process. So I would think during 2020 that would resolve itself. The timing by the way as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're filing our final brief over the next set of days here. And there could potentially be oral arguments that would occur. So I wouldn't expect necessarily the judge to rule on this for instance during the month of November. It's probably out just a little ways, if they happen to go through oral arguments, which is not an uncommon thing in this case. So pending that happening it could be a little bit of time before we hear that.","But again, I think an arbitration process would be a lot quicker going through the legal system would be a little bit longer. So that's kind of how I would handicap it at this point in time. But by the way, I would just reiterate and I said this in my comments, but just to kind of put an exclamation point on this. I mentioned a few documents with the uncapped language. There's also filings by Chemours, public filings that they signed by their Chairman and CEO that talked about uncapped documents. And I would not even venture to tell you how many e-mails there are in the system that talk about uncapped liabilities. So it's very cut and dry in all the documentation throughout the company.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Thank you. Appreciate the disclosure on the PFAS. You make a comment in here that you've never sold PFOA. I was curious whether in the years that DuPont manufactured products that PFOA was used in the process, was it simply a surfactant used as an aid in the manufacture of a product or was the product derived from it and contained in the product that you sold?","Ed Breen","No. It was used in the process. And remember, look the clarification I think a lot of this gets blown out of proportion because of articles that are written and we seem to get our name up in a lot of them. But it was -- we used it in a manufacturing process in four manufacturing facilities in the U.S. That's it. We didn't have it in our end products. By the way, my -- the comment I made where more of the legal issues are and more of the locations are is firefighting foam. DuPont and Chemours never had anything at all to do with firefighting foam. So I think people blow it up a little bit more here, but it's literally four locations. Chemours is liable for it and we've been doing groundwater remediation in those locations for quite a few years. And by the way it will continue for many years.","And by the way a very key point here with all the talk around this the last -- we're two years now as of July 1 into the 5-year agreement with Chemours, where Chemours pays the first $25 million in a year and then DuPont will chip in the next $25 million. And then after that it's a Chemours liability.","In two years now, we have not paid a penny, because Chemours has not gone over the $25 million limit. I would also say that we have some things we would like to clean up. We're clearly in close communication with Chemours on this. We have about 64 personal injury claims.","Remember we settled 3550 of them all from one location by the way. And we have about I think 64 more there. It would be nice for us to get those resolved. And then we'll continue the groundwater remediation at the four locations that I mentioned. So I think we have this thing well contained, well boxed in. And over time, we'll get a couple of these other things cleaned up like the personal injury cases.","Operator","And next we will hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Ed does the Chemours lawsuit have any impact on the timing of the portfolio actions? And I know it's hard to say but any sense of when we might see the first of these transactions from a timing perspective? Thank you.","Ed Breen","Well -- well no. The Chemours suit will have no bearing on any strategic actions we take on the portfolio. And look I can't talk timing but let me just go back to the comment I made a few minutes ago where Marc, Jean, me we're all -- we're in a seven-day a week mode right now. It feels like back when we were doing stuff of talking to Dow and getting things going. So we're busy. We know what we want to do and we're pursuing.","Operator","Next we will hear from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys.","Marc Doyle","Good morning, Jonas.","Jonas Oxgaard","I was wondering which Halloween candy you're more exposed to.","Marc Doyle","I want some of that candy by the way.","Jonas Oxgaard","I figured it had to be. More realistically well coming back to the divestiture of the wafer business, can you talk a little bit more about the process leading up to this? Is that something that you shopped around? Were you approached? Was there a strategic review beforehand?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Jonas, it's Marc. I'll take that one. And yes, so like the other Non-Core divestitures we've tried to run good disciplined processes. So this was a case where we knew there would be some strategic buyer interest because of the growth in silicon carbide. And so we tried to move as quickly as we could to take advantage of kind of the industry dynamics in that area. And we ran a good process multiple buyers. The final bidder that won obviously was the best offer that we got.","Operator","And next we will hear from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.","John McNulty","Hey, thanks for taking my question \u2013 thanks for taking my question, guys. So, on the innovation pipeline that's going to help to keep driving your business better than GDP I guess, can you give us some thoughts on how that pipeline will contribute in 2020? Or put another way, if we have a flat macro environment, how can we be thinking about the organic growth tied to some of the innovation that you're bringing out?","Marc Doyle","Yes, John, it's Marc. I'll take that one. I mean, we're really confident in the strength of our innovation pipeline right now. And I think honestly it's never been stronger than it is. We've really focused around a small number of very powerful themes with our innovation spend. We're still spending about -- around about 4% of sales on R&D. Expectations from me for sure that we're going to get more out of that the investment than we maybe ever have historically.","A couple of the big themes that we're spending around auto electrification is one. We've got multiple new product innovations in that space enabling lightweighting, enabling heat removal from battery packs, enabling miniaturization of electric motors and inverters, a lot of high-performance materials. And that's both new launches and customer qualifications.","We're also spending very aggressively on 5G. We mentioned earlier some of the uptake in antenna materials. Those are based on new product launches that are happening this year. We have some additional new innovations coming in high-frequency that will roll out over the next couple of years out of the pipeline.","And then maybe a third area, I'd just mention is microbiome. The broader space than probiotics is about not just more bacterial strains with new clinical indications but also how can we attach additional offerings to our probiotics business, which is currently the leading franchise in probiotics. But we're trying to double down and bring out new offerings like additional services, data prebiotics and more advanced sort of complex formulations that can further sort of double down on the growth in that space. So I'm really bullish on the pipeline. I'd stay away from giving a specific revenue number for next year till we're ready to roll out our 2020 guidance. But I think the innovation pipeline's very strong.","Operator","And next we will hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bob Koort","Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering, if I could ask about margins in your transportation and industrial business. It looked like the decremental margins there were pretty painful on the volume loss. So, I guess a combination question. When would you expect given the current environment to see those volume comparisons get a little bit more level? And then secondly, what would you think about your incremental margin expansion as volumes come back in that business?","Marc Doyle","Yeah. Bob let me kick it off. This is Marc. And then I'll hand it off, if Jean wants to add anything. I'd say \u2013 I mean, you're certainly right. Volumes have been really soft this year. In T&I business and in particular the nylons and plastics are relatively lower gross margin businesses, so there is a significant loss of leverage, when the volumes soften. Price has been softening too as a result of the weak demand in the industry and so that's also hurting the margins. We've talked about this now for a couple of quarters as being not just the weakness in the industry, but also destocking in our channels, which is exacerbating. And that's why while the auto market is down mid-single digits we're down even higher than that.","We are expecting that this will stabilize at some point. Hard to call based on the uncertainty this year. But going into the fourth quarter, we're currently seeing inventory levels relatively stable in the channel. We're not seeing a pickup in demand, but we are seeing some signs of some sequential improvement. So September as an example was a pretty good month versus 2019 for us. So, again hard to call. In terms of the actions that we're taking, Jean do you want to \u2013 ","Jean Desmond","I mean, I think T&I is an example differentially managing our businesses whereas you look across the portfolio you'll see the lowest kind of selling R&D expense in this business. And I give Randy and his team a lot of credit. As we've gone into this year, we saw the steep drop off in December they very quickly \u2013 December of last year. They very quickly took action to further right-size the business and take cost out. So that gives me a lot of confidence that we get through destocking we see a rebound in auto builds that this business is going to be very well-positioned to benefit from that.","Ed Breen","Well, and probably we've run historically over auto build in this business as you know until the destocking kicked in pretty severely in mid-December last year. So we get through destocking at least we'll stabilize kind of around to where auto builds are plus some increment to that with the content that we drive into the end market. So that will play out in the near future.","Operator","Next we will take a question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","Thank you. Did your animal nutrition business benefit at all from swine fever in China? And I was surprised that the food enzyme business was up. I thought the weakness in food ingredients was a little bit more broad-based than just probiotics.","Marc Doyle","John, I'll take that. No not a huge benefit. Animal nutrition has been a good market for us, because we've had a very strong franchise around the phytase area. And so we're benefiting kind of from global growth characteristics more meat usage. And then around food enzymes, I mean, we're \u2013 as you're probably aware, we're not the largest supplier of food enzymes. We are seeing very attractive growth off a relatively small base and so food enzymes continue to be for us kind of a high single-digit growth.","Animal nutrition by the way in the quarter was about a mid-single-digit 5% growth. So those are bright spots in the enzymes portfolio. I would say, the segment \u2013 Health & Biosciences segment within Nutrition & Biosciences was down about 1% this quarter. And so it was a little bit soft overall. But those were some of the bright spots.","Operator","And next we will hear from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi good morning.","Ed Breen","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","Ed on your potential strategic transactions, can you make some general observations about M&A multiples that you're seeing given the falling rates?","And then secondly there, is PFAS liability becoming a sticking point in negotiating these deals? Thank you.","Ed Breen","Yeah. P.J. yes thanks for the questions. No the PFOA has not been an issue in things that we're looking at and working on. So I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. It doesn't concern me. And just from a multiple standpoint, it's hard to answer that but I'll just say broadly multiples are very good when you're looking at transactions right now. And by the way just to give you one, I think multiples in the N&B type sector are at all-time highs right now. And I think a lot of that is it's just a steady business, a steady industry, which kind of recession proof. People are going to eat. And they command multiples up around 20% the real premium companies, which I think we are the premium company in the space. So multiples are not an issue in what we're working on.","Operator","Next we will hear from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks. I'm just trying to understand the earnings algorithm from here. Could you kind of touch on your outlook for cost reductions and synergy capture if there's any left into 2020? And then similarly assuming price is going to offset FX, what will be the main drivers that would help you get some volume growth next year? Thanks.","Jean Desmond","Sure. Thank you. Let me first address synergies. So as we look at 2019, we had about $450 million of synergies through the DowDuPont and we're going to wrap that up in 2020. We have about another $160 million, $165 million synergies in them when we finish that program.","The good news is and we talked about this the last quarter that productivity is in our DNA. It's really important. I talked about the work that Randy and his team have done and other parts of our businesses as we've come into 2019 to deal with the softness in some of our end markets. And so we've taken productivity actions this year and that's going to give us a bit of a tailwind as we go into 2020 as well. So you can think about maybe another $50 million plus of benefits from the timing of those actions going into 2020.","In terms of our broader 2020 guidance, we're going to talk about that more when we announce fourth quarter earnings late January, early February. But I think we're looking at similar macro dynamics from 2019 into 2020. We're going to be fairly cautious as we think about 2020. But there are certainly bright spots in our portfolio that we continue to be excited about whether it's probiotics, pharmaceuticals, water, the aerospace business is doing quite well. And then we've got the continued challenging dynamics with the tariffs and trade that are impacting, of course, most clearly auto but also electronics to some extent.","Ed Breen","Just to reiterate what Jean said. We as a management team Marc and Jean and I all of us we're saying, let's plan for, kind of, the macro we have now. Clearly hopefully during the next months some resolution on China tariffs occurs, so that would be a green shoot. And I think the biggest green shoot for all of us in the industrial sector is, obviously, everyone is easing all over the world.","I think I was looking at 32 countries the other day that are all -- have easing going on. And clearly that -- most experts tell me that kicks in eight, nine months later with some positive momentum. So there's some green shoots out there, obviously, that could be helpful to us. But it -- we're like don't count on any of that, let's just plan conservatively. And we'll tee ourselves up properly from a cost structure and all as we go into 2020.","Operator","Next we will hear from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. ","Frank Mitsch","Hey, good morning, and pretty impressive results out of China. You mentioned that it was largely premium smartphone-driven. I'm just curious what percent roughly are you manufacturing in country? And can you talk about the trade flow issues and just in general what the tariff conflict has impacted DuPont and what your outlook is there?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Frank, thanks. This is Marc. I'll take that one. The rough number on our China sales we have about 15% of our sales into China. A decent portion is manufactured locally. But I'd call it maybe about half-ish of the sales. We do have some products that are manufactured in the U.S. that are sent over to China. That's a smaller portion of the total because we're also manufacturing around Asia too and shipping into China.","As a result the tariff impact is not real huge for us. When you look at that portion that's direct sales in terms of dollars it comes to about $50 million on a full year basis of tariff impact so -- pretty well mitigated for a company our size. I think it still going to be a positive when we see a resolution to the U.S.-China trade disputes. But the positive is not so much the direct impact of the tariffs it's more just the stimulus to the economy, the industrial growth in China and obviously the industrial growth in Europe and the U.S. And we think that's a much bigger lever for us than the direct tariff impact.","Operator","Next we will hear from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Could you just clarify two things? The -- is any signs of a sequential improvement in China ex electronics? And the comments about nylon 66 rebalancing how much of an impact that has been and what that means for 2020?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Laurence I'll take that. And so in terms of China ex electronics yes we've been pretty strong in S&C pretty strong in N&B through the year. Those have continued to hold up well in China. T&I which has been down significantly we're not seeing a significant rebound as yet. So that's the exception. And then electronics obviously was a big trajectory change in China. And then the second question around nylon 66 was...","Jean Desmond ","Yes. I mean I think if you look at T&I we did see sequentially a pricing decline from second quarter to third quarter of about 2%. And we would expect to see some continued -- the same continued dynamic as we go into fourth quarter with.","Operator","And next we will hear from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. ","Mark Connelly","Thank you. If I could just ask how -- you've given us a lot of information on a lot of different businesses and the economic impact. But if we were to strip out the macro impact how would you rate your performance relative to where you thought you would be on controllable issues? And how do you see the opportunity over the next year in controllables? Is it more on the revenue side or is it more on the volume and product side?","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Pardon the interruption. We are unable to hear the presenters. And please standby as we are experiencing some technical difficulty.","[Technical Difficulty]","And Mark, if you could repeat your questions.","Mark Connelly","Sure. Ed, you've talked a lot about what your strategies are in the portfolio. But what I'm trying to understand is, if we think about the economy is what it is and you look at what you've controlled and what you want to control, how much opportunity do you see ahead in controllables in this sort of flat macro environment on the cost side versus on the revenue side?","Marc Doyle","Yes. Mark. Sorry about the break there. This is Marc Doyle. Yes. I think we've done a reasonably good job certainly with being aggressive on cost actions. And we think that there's more room to continue to drive productivity around cost. A couple of additional degrees of freedom we have are manufacturing production costs levels of automation. We've also got some opportunities to continue to debottleneck our manufacturing sites because we do have areas where demand is still outstripping supply. And so, those I'd call more sort of self-help related cost actions. I think we've also done a nice job focusing the innovation spend and the capital spend around areas where we have continued upside even in some of the softer market conditions. And I think that those actions will continue to benefit us going forward.","Ed Breen","And Marc, just to add on to that, the team is still working on obviously, the synergies we're capturing the rest of this year, but we have $165 million more of synergies next year. And if you remember, right, I think it was last quarter we announced a restructuring where we were taking -- where we took $30 million out in the second quarter and we were working on -- we are working on $80 million for the second half of this year in addition to the synergies, which will obviously play through 2020 also. And it would -- as a management team; we have many other items we're looking at on the cost side that if we feel like we need to pull those levers next year, we certainly would do that. So, we're kind of preplanning on all of that.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan ","Thanks. Regarding PFAS again. There's a movie coming out that invokes DuPont by name and smears the company as being a bad actor. Are there any legal remedies for that that you know of? And are you planning any kind of public response to the allegations?","Ed Breen","Yeah. I'll let Marc comment on some of the things we're doing. But first of all, let me just say, the movie is not true facts. It's quote \u2013 well, I think the trailer I saw was inspired by. And I've had a pretty good debriefing on it and it's just not true material in it.","So we have -- I'll let Marc comment. We're doing obviously doing some things for employees and all that so they understand facts and all that. I'm not going to comment on the legal piece. But obviously, we have a lot of legal folks have been looking at this and I'm just going to leave that there for now.","Marc Doyle","Yeah. Let me just build on Ed's comments. I mean, unfortunately in a situation like this it just doesn't do you much good to fight it out in the public eye. And that would just drive more and more attention to it. So, we're really focused internally on our employees, our communities, our families getting the facts out there preparing people for the bad publicity that's likely to come.","As Ed said, this isn't an accurate portrayal of the facts. It's certainly not the company that any of us know. I've been with DuPont for 25 years myself. This is -- the behaviors that you might see in there are certainly not the behaviors that I witnessed at any point in my career. And so, we're really focused on our people and trying to just prepare them.","Operator","And with no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Lori Koch for any additional or closing remarks.","Lori Koch","Thank you everyone for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes our call.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

I would now like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Quarterly Investor Call. (Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl, you may begin.","Carl Lukach","","Good morning everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont\u2019s first quarter 2014 performance. Joining me today are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President, Agriculture and Nutrition.","The slides for today\u2019s presentation can be found on our website along with our news release. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We also will refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review our reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today\u2019s slides posted on our website.","For today\u2019s agenda, Nick will review our first quarter financial will review our first quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. Jim will then provide insight into our agriculture segment and will conclude with Ellen\u2019s comments after which we will be happy to take your questions.","With that introduction, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick.","","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you Carl and good morning everyone. On slide 3, you can see our summary results for the quarter. Operating earnings per share were $1.58 up 1% from last year. Consolidated net sales were 10.1 billion which was down 3% however to understand our company\u2019s performance in the quarter you have to look deeper. We saw positive steady growth in industrial market demand for DuPont products and strong earnings growth in most of our segments. Similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2013. In fact we saw volume growth in each of our industrial related segments during the first quarter. This growth however was offset by the negative price variance in our performance chemical segment principally due to refrigerants and difference in year-over-year timing of sales and planted area in our AG segment.","In addition segment results were affected by an unfavorable currency impact that was steeper than anticipated. We will go over in more detail the source and impact of the conditions that offset otherwise clear momentum in most of our businesses including the adverse winter weather we discussed in our March 10th, 8K filing.","Moving to slide 4, you can see the highlights of our segment operating earnings variance. Jim will provide details about our AG segment performance but first I will cover the other segments. Safety and protection had modest top line growth but earnings growth was up 27%, margins improved year-over-year resulting from continued cost productivity actions. Electronics and communication segment operating earnings were up 53% over last year on strong PV volumes versus a weak quarter last year.","Metal prices in the first quarter were lower than the prior year which reduced our sales. Nutrition and health sales were 1% lower as price gains were more than offset by unfavorable currency. However segment operating earnings were up 22% due to enhanced product mix, lower raw material cost and productivity gains. Industrial biosciences revenues were up 4% and segment operating earnings were up 37% on higher demand for enzymes for U.S. ethanol production.","Performance materials had a 2% segment operating earnings growth as strong auto volumes in performance polymers were largely offset by weather impacts and higher ethane cost in packaging and in industrial polymers.","Segment results in North America were also constrained as we prepared for a second quarter scheduled ethylene outage. The extended cold weather temporarily impacted our manufacturing, supply chain and operating cost and several plan locations. In performance chemical segment TiO2 volumes increased 7% in the quarter. Our performance chemical segment earnings were down 20% however due primarily to lower prices in fluoroproducts principally refrigerants. Higher raw material and energy costs as a result of the adverse weather and lower Ti02 prices were also contributors. Segment volumes are recovering, but margins are generally lower due to year-over-year price variances. The second quarter typically represents peak seasonal demand in North America markets for both for both TiO2 and refrigerants.","While we anticipate TiO2 industry fundamentals will continue to improve we believe it will be at a measured pace. Overall our company managed well through severe weather conditions which mostly impacted performance materials and performance chemicals. In total we estimate that our segment operating earnings were about $0.07 lower in the quarter due to missed sales and higher cost associated with weather related plant disruptions and higher raw material cost.","Turning now to slide 5, I would like to cover our regional results. Most of the impact from adverse weather and year-over-year on shifts in AG occurred in the Americas. As you can see on this slide, U.S. and Canada sales were down 8% and Latin America sales were down 10%. We had strong volume growth in Europe, sales in developed EMEA grew 9% and our sales in developing EMEA grew 8%. We see a recovery underway in Europe for DuPont products led by our agriculture, electronics, performance chemicals, performance materials and safety and protection segments.","Improved pricing of our products particularly in agriculture and positive currency variances contributed favorably to these regional results. In Asia-Pacific, we had solid growth in developing Asia with sales volumes up partially offset by lower price and negative currency impact. Within this developing region China sales volumes were up led by higher performance material sales into the auto markets. Electronics volume grew in China primarily in photovoltaics which was more than offset by the declines in metals pricing for silver. Lastly in India, strong volume growth was over shadowed by negative currency impact.","In developed Asia-Pacific sales were down about 6% due primarily to currency and lower metals pass through pricing in electronics and communications. Turning now to slide 6, we have summarized the changes in our operating EPS in more detail here. As you can see EG&L and tax largely offset each other. With regard to currency, the devaluations in Argentina and the Ukraine contributed to the variance. In total exchange losses resulted in a hurt to earnings of about $0.05 per share. Our base tax rate was 20.5%, 2.9 points lower than last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 23.4. This provided a year-on-year benefit of $0.06 per share. We still expect a full year base tax rate to be about 22%.","Corporate expenses of $201 million in the quarter were down slightly reflecting further progress with our ongoing productivity initiatives. We\u2019re on track and expect to achieve our targets of 450 million from our 2012 restructuring program.","Turning now to slide 7, in the first quarter\u2019s operating earnings you will notice that we excluded transaction related cost for the plan performance chemical separation. While these costs were relatively small only one penny in the first quarter. Our best estimate at this time is that the full year we will spend about a $170 million pretax for separation cost or about $0.13 per share.","These costs will mostly be encouraged to prepare audited financial statements, build the necessary standalone information technology systems and create separate legal structures around the world. We will continue to report these costs as significant items and exclude them from our operating earnings and we will provide at a later date an estimate of the separation cost we expect to incur in 2015.","Many of you have asked where we\u2019re in our performance chemical separation activities. I\u2019m pleased to say that we remain on track for a mid-2015 spinoff and our work is progressing well. Specifically site separation plans are well underway and day one operating plans are defined. Also we\u2019re creating new legal structures around the world to house the separated businesses and are actively completing standalone financial statements for the new company. We expect to make our regulatory filings in the fourth quarter of this year. In the interim our performance chemical leaders will continue to be focused on serving our customers while advancing the plans for separation.","Turning now to slide 8, we maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter. Our negative pre-cash flow of 2.7 billion slightly better than last year reflects our typical seasonal agricultural cash outflow in the quarter and lower cash payments for taxes.","In the first quarter we began the share repurchase program we announced in January with open market purchases and a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. Under the ASR, we retired 12.5 million shares in February and expect to finalize the ASR in the second quarter of this year.","With this ASR we\u2019re more than halfway towards meeting our commitment of $2 billion of repurchases in the year. ","Net debt has increased in the quarter over last year and over our ending 2013 balance which reflects our normal seasonal shifts. In addition to repurchasing about 1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter we used existing cash balances to fund our seasonal agriculture requirements and other working capital needs. We also used existing cash to retire 1.2 billion of maturing long term debt in the quarter.","In summary, despite the challenges we faced from weather and the difficult year-over-year comparisons in AG our businesses delivered a solid quarter largely in-line with our expectations. Looking ahead for the remainder of the year we are reaffirming our full year outlook of $4.20 to $4.45 operating earnings per share. In light of quarter run-results, we expect 70% of our full year operating earnings per share to occur in the first half of this year.","We\u2019re encouraged by the signs we\u2019re seeing of continued, modest year-on-year global growth in industrial production and the gradual sequential improvement and demand for our products and we\u2019re confident of our growth and our strength in agriculture.","Now with that let me turn it over to Jim. Jim?","Jim Borel","","Thank you Nick. As we anticipated in early March sales in our agriculture segment ended at 4.4 billion which was below last year\u2019s record first quarter volumes were 7% lower while price which was negatively impacted by exchange rates increased 1%. Operating earnings declined 55 to 1.4 billion on lower seed sales as a result of shifts on in both timing and planted area. Higher volumes and a stronger mix in crop protection as well as lower seed input cost partially offset the decline in seed sales. We continue to grow our insect control business in Latin America led by Rynaxypyr and delivered pricing gains in seeds inline with our plant for the season.","However first quarter agriculture segment sales were negatively impacted by several factors including lower plant at hybrid corn area in Brazil safrinha season expectations that farmers will plant less corn this spring in North America delayed farmer decision making in North America and reductions in herbicide sales primarily in North America.","Also as we discussed in January the earlier timing of seed shipments caused of that a $100 million of operating earnings to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2013 rather than the first quarter this year.","In seeds first quarter sales declined 9% to $3.3 billion due to shifts in timing and planted area driven by less favorable corn economies farmers in Brazil planted fewer hectares of hybrid corn in the safrinha season than last year. With growers in North America continuing to demand our newest hybrids and varieties with innovative trade technologies we grew price and remain on track for modest price growth in the region. Optimum acre max products are expected to be about 2\/3rds of our corn volume and our innovative optimum AQUAmax hybrids are expected to be planted on over 10 million acres. In addition we\u2019re excited about our newest soybean varieties as we transition our line up to pioneer brand T Series soybeans and launch soybeans with the Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait.","North American growers recently signaled to the USDA they intend to plan less than 92 million corn acres or about 4 million acres below last year and commodity prices continue to favor soybeans acres. As a result, we\u2019re seeing some farmers delaying crop decisions until closer to planning and as usual weather will be a final deciding factor for them. Because our first quarter ends in a middle of a season delayed decisions by farmers will mean that some sales will shift from our first quarter to the second. This is unlikely accelerated pace of sales we saw in first quarter last year. I would like to move now to talking about innovation at DuPont Pioneer.","As you may know in February we launched Encirca services our next generation decision agriculture offering the response from growers has been very positive and Encirca services offer growers tailored, brand neutral whole farm solutions and Encirca services leverages pioneers advantage route to market working directly with the growers to analyze their data and provide recommendations based on individual needs and priorities.","As a result of our strong competitive position we expect to approach 500,000 acres of fee based variable rate seeding prescriptions in 2014 and preparation for the 2015 season we\u2019re piloting advanced services for nitrogen, fertility and irrigation with wider availability of Encirca yield service beginning in third quarter.","Turning to Eastern Europe, we have a long history and a strong market position in Ukraine and while Ukraine represents a few percent of our sales in agriculture it's an important element of our growth plan. Given our uncertain political situation there and the tightened credit markets we\u2019re seeing seed buying decisions being reduced or deferred. Even though first quarter Ukraine\u2019s seed sales were below our expectations. Europe delivered double digit sales growth in the first quarter and all of Eastern Europe remains a high growth priority for us. Switching gears we continued our growth in crop protection in the first quarter, sales were 3% higher at $1.1 billion. Regionally we had strong crop protection growth across Latin America with sales up robustly at 60%.","Insect pressure was intense in corn and soybeans which created strong demand for our Rynaxypyr, Avatar, Lannate insect control solutions. In North America the cold wet weather and higher than normal herbicide channel inventories resulted in lower first quarter herbicide sales. This follows last year\u2019s strong first quarter in North America herbicides. Our crop protection business continues to be strengthened by innovation and we\u2019re launching several novel products into new markets to meet the needs of farmers. This includes Lumigen seed treatments, Cyazypyr for insect control and our Picoxystrobin and Penthiopyrad additives expanded disease control portfolio.","As we look to the second quarter for the agriculture segment we expect modest sales growth and significant growth in operating earnings as crop protection continues to grow and delayed seed sales shipped into the second quarter from first quarter. So for the first quarter which represents the majority of the Northern Hemisphere season, we expect flat sales however earnings should be up slightly despite the earlier seed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Also we expect to improve operating margins due to both price gains and lower seed input cost recovering the one point margin decline in last year\u2019s first half. However our first half 2014 outlook is now lower than our view was in January as volumes will be further impacted by lower than expected corn plantings in Brazil, North America and Ukraine.","Despite the variability we\u2019re seeing as agriculture markets transition from last year\u2019s peak we remain enthusiastic about long term growth which will be driven by our innovative products and services, strong global positions and the ongoing need to sustainably increase AG productivity to meet worldwide demand. Now I will turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen Kullman ","Thank you Jim. On slide 10, I would like to share my perspective on the quarter in the context of progress we\u2019re making against our overall growth strategy. We entered 2014 solid momentum, we delivered stronger earnings growth and margin improvement in the majority of our segments and we\u2019re well positioned for future growth in key markets. The value of our diverse portfolio and superior execution were highly visible this quarter as we delivered near record operating earnings per share despite short term head winds from the weather and a year-on-year shifts in AG markets that Jim described. The positive trends we saw in the market this quarter and our results indicate the strength of our strategy and our team\u2019s ability to execute.","Directionally we see a compelling outlook for 2014 across our portfolio, we expect steady year-on-year growth in demand from key regions and markets. For example demand in Europe continues to recover which will benefit our performance and materials, safety and protection and performance chemicals segments. In China, we continue to expect stable growth across most of our businesses. In the U.S., we continue to expect gradual sequential improvement in demand from industrial, housing and automotive markets.","By segment in agriculture we\u2019re excited about our newest seed and crop protection products and are extending our successful insect control franchise into seed treatments. We have launched Lumiderm in Canada for Canola and are in the prelaunch phase with Dermacor for soybeans in Brazil.","We will continue to invest in, in advanced projects in both our seed and crop protection pipelines and leverage these across global production agriculture markets. In nutrition and health we expect strong full year operating earnings and margin growth this year as we continue to enhance our product offering. Increase our cost productivity and pursue growth in higher value market opportunities like probiotics and cultures. In industrial bioscience we\u2019re making excellent progress against our strategy while at the same time delivering strong earnings growth.","Since we acquired Genencor as part of Genesco two years ago, made investments in research and development in promising new enzyme spaces and we\u2019re drawing and healthy dividend from that decision today. For example our Axtra PHY animal nutrition, our cold water detergent enzymes and new ethanol offerings have positioned us well for future market share gain and growth. In parallel we expanded our global reach and now our broad market coverage is coupled with a fundamentally stronger portfolio.","We\u2019re also planning to finish construction of our new cellulosic ethanol plant at end of this year. In advance materials electronics and communications delivered 53% and 116% growth for the past two quarters versus prior year largely from recovery of photovoltaic module production in China. We continue to see the solar photovoltaic market as an excellent long term value creation opportunity for us. Our latest Solamet pastes products and enhanced Kevlar back sheets are vital materials that increase conversion efficiency while extending the life of the modules. Both critical elements of our value proposition.","In the short term we learned in 2012 that this market can shift quickly so we will continue to stay close to our large industry leading customers to accurately gauge future demand. Also in advance materials we launched over 30 new product applications in the first quarter in our safety and protection businesses reflecting our strategy to strengthen our leading position in differentiated high value materials.","We introduced a new platform of Nomex electrical insulation products for high voltage applications in transformers and electrical motors. We\u2019re increasing our penetration with Nomex in the hybrid electrical vehicle motors. We\u2019re bringing to the mining industry a new light weight Kevlar for conveyor belts.","And we added last week a new generation of multi-threat and water resistant solutions made with DuPont Kevlar that will extend our range of protective solutions for the military, police and security markets. And lastly in our performance material segment, we introduced new non-halogenated flame retardant nylon resins which offer best in class, high heat resistance with the advantages of being more environmentally friendly and safer to handle. And we\u2019re seeing an increase in acceptance of renewably sourced resins in automotive fluid management systems. This application underlines our strategy to develop products with lower cost, higher performance and improved carbon footprint, versus petrochemical alternatives.","Moving into slide 11 in our operational priorities. Let me describe how our operational priorities are driving disciplined execution. First, innovation, we\u2019re committed to strong pipeline management, disciplined execution and increasing our return on research and development. There is no better results of this effort than delivering innovative, science based solutions that are first or best in class and catalyze revenue growth and margin improvement.","One example emerged from our DuPont innovation center in Troy, Michigan performance polymers team collaborated with Illinois Tool Works and Ford to develop a new automotive component. The result was a new coolant crossover part with DuPont Zytel high temperature nylon that lower cost and improved fuel efficiency by just placing metal. The new part design was named a finalist in the Society of Plastic Engineers, Most Innovative Use of Plastic\u2019s Award.","Another innovation center example is our exciting collaboration with Nike on materials that will enhance their footwear and golf ball products performance. DuPont Science is at the core of Nike Golf next generation RZN golf ball. Most Nike Golf athletes have put the new ball into play in 2014 and to-date five Nike athletes including Rory McIlroy have won with the new RZN technology on the professional tours around the globe.","Finally in March DuPont\u2019s and Procter & Gamble were the joint winners of the 2014 sustainable bio-award for bio-based product innovation of the year. The two companies were recognized for their pioneering effort to achieve the previously impossible providing the cleaning power of warm water while washing clothes at cold water temperatures. The new product delivers unprecedented environmental benefits to the detergent industry and appeals to consumer\u2019s interest and energy efficiency. These are just three examples from the quarter of the way DuPont translates our scientific capabilities into solutions that our customers deeply value.","The second operational priority is to leverage our global reach in both developed markets and in fast growing areas like China, Asian [ph], Eastern Europe and Latin America. In developed markets we continue to invest in applications development for strategic accounts those customers who are global industry leaders as a way to increase our market temperature rates. In fast growing developing markets we continue to invest in people and facilities to extend our reach. As Nick reported we saw strong volume growth in the quarter in European and Asian developing markets as we capitalized on the continued rise of the middle class and demand for higher value products.","When new markets open we capitalize by entering first with our agriculture products and then follow with our advanced materials products. For example earlier this year we opened our first office in Myanmar and look forward to future growth in that country. Our third operational priority execution, this includes productivity, optimizing resource allocation and returning cash to shareholders. Last quarter I mentioned we\u2019re taking the opportunity in 2014 to review our total business support cost across the company as we approach the performance chemicals separation we\u2019re currently evaluating our corporate core cost and we\u2019re assessing how our businesses are deployed regionally and functionally to determine the most efficient structure.","We\u2019re making good progress in our efforts to identify the right structure, to optimize resource allocation and increase returns on capital. We will keep you updated on our actions. In closing we\u2019re executing well and advancing against our strategic and operational priorities. We expect our plan to deliver attractive growth in value for our shareholders as it has done over the past five years and strongly position DuPont to deliver the next generation of innovation and with that I will turn it back to Carl.","Carl Lukach ","Thank you Ellen. Now we will turn back to you John and accept questions from our callers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","You indicated an EPS impact of $0.07 from inclimate weather. Can you speak to how much of that is gone forever versus how much you might be able to recover in the second quarter and to the extent you can\u2019t recover perhaps you can speak to impact on individual businesses there sequentially.","Ellen Kullman","Most of it was cost base was increased energy and increased logistics cost to be able to move materials and that cost base is probably going to take us the rest of the year to recover it through additional productivity actions. I don\u2019t Nick, is there anything you would like to add with more specifics?","Nick Fanandakis","No I think you covered I mean if you look at the areas where they are most impacted it was in our performance materials and in our performance chemical segment and Ellen characterized the types of expenses that we incurred. So you can get a sense of the amount that would be coming back and the amount that was at one time.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And this is a follow-up sticking with whether some other companies in the space have indicated an early spring in Europe. Did you observe any benefits across your portfolio in that region?","Ellen Kullman","Well I just got back from Europe last week and I can confirm that it was a heck of a lot warmer and more bugs on the trees than there it is here and I think Europe represented a more normal well it actually was a great volume because we\u2019re seeing improvements there, but I don\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have the impact on whether things like that. I don\u2019t know Jim maybe you can comment on the AG side in Europe.","Jim Borel","For the most part of course we see a little impact from weather on particularly on the seed side, of course we\u2019re moving into a time of the year when weather will play a bigger rule in terms of what actually gets planted and what happens. But fairly small impact today.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","I think your U.S. dollar price change in agriculture was plus 1% year-over-year. What would it have been in local currency?","Ellen Kullman","Well price was up 2.6 I think it's a right number, Jim correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Currency was negative 1.5.","Jim Borel","Yes that\u2019s right. We had modest price increases across the AG segment.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","And can you talk a little bit about your electronics segment, did you see a recovery at all in consumer electronic side of the business or was it really all in solar and how do you see the global electronics markets as it touches DuPont both on the solar side and on the non-solar side?","Ellen Kullman","Electronics and communications had a good quarter, we saw nice growth. Most of that was due to PV and consumer electronics I would characterize it as expected that it's improving but it's not a standout from that standpoint. We had a good quarter in PV, Kevlar both and Solamet pastes we\u2019re anticipating that the market is going to grow 15% this year. But you have to remember last year in electronics, I mean it was a weak comparative so we still see this market is seeing lumpy or bumpy or whichever way we want to talk about it. We\u2019re seeing that China is probably the wild card and future quarters around whether they meet their 10 gigawatts have installed. The metal impact you saw on the top line so that kind of mutes the top line growth but they had great earnings progress for the year.","So we\u2019re positive in terms of what we have seen in electronics but as you know based on what happened in \u201912 PV is something we watch very, very carefully.","Operator","Your next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Ellen just on the business support cost review, do you think you will be in a position this quarter to complete our review and the size and opportunity could be as much as that, $0.5 billion a cost would be taken out over a period of time?","Ellen Kullman","Well we\u2019re not going to size it right now for you Dave, sorry about that. Because we\u2019re really right now in the process. So if you think about the fact that we sold coatings last year that we\u2019re spinning chemicals next year. That\u2019s a good portion of the company that won't exist in the second half of \u201915. So I\u2019m looking at it as a fresh start. If we were to recast how we go about supporting our businesses and enabling them to achieve consistent sustainable growth, would we structure very differently. We\u2019re going to be a very different company in the second half of \u201915. The average size of our manufacturing plants is going to be smaller. The allocation of our business both globally and by sector is going to be very different and so we\u2019re actively engaged in those meetings and hard discussions right now. The good part about this since we really control the timing of the spin that we\u2019re here to have real work completed and discussions externally this year because we want to enter \u201915 with momentum and so when we\u2019re done and we\u2019re ready and we got it cooked [ph] then we will bring it out to you guys. But I think you will be pleased overall with what you\u2019re going to see.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Understand and just on the cost also SG&A was down 6% in the quarter before this whole cost action, what\u2019s driving the reduction right now in Q1 and for full year would you expect SG&A to be flat or down or up?","Nick Fanandakis","Well what\u2019s driving the reduction is the productivity work that we continue to have across the company and we\u2019re doing that in SG&A as well and this is while at the same time investing in a lot of areas for growth in that same respect. So in AG for example the programs we have the expanding of the channel, continuing to drive that channel access, all of those things growing in certain areas but the productivity gains that we have are really what\u2019s driving some of those reductions.","Operator","And our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","","Ellen I wanted to follow-up on the review of the business support cost and when you\u2019ve had stranded cost in the past the roughly 200 million with coatings, 100 million with performance chemicals. What is the nature of those stranded cost, does that suggest where you\u2019re looking to an area where you\u2019re looking to take the most cost out of it?","Ellen Kullman","Yes I think if you think about it Don, let\u2019s take an example, we filed tax returns in every country where we operate just because we\u2019re spinning performance chemicals doesn\u2019t mean we have to file any less tax returns but at the same time when you allocate the cost or understand the cost of those tax returns across the entire company on a smaller revenue base. So on a per dollar revenue goes up. So the question is can we think about tax differently? Is our structure, our legal entity structure such that it helps our businesses succeed or do we have too many and should we consolidate it down and really then let this limit the amount of work that has to be done there.","I mean that\u2019s just a small example versus many in terms of how we support the businesses regionally how we support them functionally. I mean that\u2019s same thing, you can talk about whether it's paying bills or collecting cash or sourcing. We just need to think about are we leveraging standardizing the most common on the work and really putting our differential resources towards where they can really help the business. So Nick you have been in right in the midst of this big time.","Nick Fanandakis","Yes I think Ellen you characterized it really well just a second ago when you talked about fresh start. Looking at how we\u2019re going to be structured as a company with about 20% of our revenue now being gone between the spins and divestures and looking at that in a very clean slate sort of way and how we\u2019re going to do a buildup of the infrastructure within the functions, where we could simply things, where we can change things so that we can operate more effectively and more standardized, digitized sort of way.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","And just a follow-up on your guidance. You have maintained your EPS guidance but you\u2019re more cautious on the AG outlooks, I\u2019m just wondering where do you make up that short fall that you now see in AG versus your original expectations.","Ellen Kullman","Yes so I think if you look to the full year, we\u2019re seeing stability and TiO2 from a market demand standpoint, volume growth in the performance chemical segment. It looks like it's going to be, it's a refrigerant comes into a season and things like that and really a good sign of TiO2 is reflected on a sequential basis. Price did not go down and year-over-year it went down but on a sequential basis it was a little positive. So that\u2019s a big uncertainty that\u2019s becoming a little more certain as we go forward.","If you think about what we saw in Europe and the continued gradual improvement in demand in European markets and when you saw on the quarter that was really positive for performance materials, it was good for performance chemicals and safety and protection. The third area point too is a stable China, there is a lot of noise about China out there but you saw in our results the automotive industry clearly there is leading yet but we saw positives there from again performance materials, performance chemicals, electronics and communications and safety and performance. So industrial production is certainly enabling a lot of this in the U.S., industrial housing and automotive markets are allowing us to continue our penetration and moving our new products and new materials in there. I gave you some examples of those and S&P in my talk.","In AG overall I think it's as we go through the entire year as it unfolds I think we had a first quarter shifts, I think we\u2019re still well positioned with good pipeline of products going forward. So we\u2019re putting a little more pressure on our sourcing guys to claw back that higher natural gas costs in the first quarter, absolutely. And we think we can bring it where we have it reaffirmed.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.","John Hirt \u2013 Citi","","This John Hirt sitting in for P.J today. In seeing [ph] that you\u2019ve got pretty good momentum down in Brazil particularly in corn where I think you gained three points of share last year both in the summer and the safrinha seasons. Do you\u2019ve any early indications as to how your share progression might have been this year?","Jim Borel","First of all it's a little too early to start talking about share because the safrinha market is just finishing. We will able to talk share after we have had a chance to evaluate the entire season but we\u2019re certainly confident about our competitiveness you\u2019re right, we have had great momentum down there. So we will continue to drive ahead.","Obviously the reduced acres is unfortunate but understandable given the commodity prices at the moment. You mentioned seed we also have some great momentum around the world but particularly in Brazil with our crop protection portfolio with some 60% growth down there, Rynaxypyr particularly had a strong quarter with (indiscernible) pressure that they were seeing. We\u2019re getting ready to launch, Dermacor is a seed treatment in soybeans we\u2019re doing the work and seeing really great early results in corn also. So we do have a lot of momentum and gives us confidence for the future.","John Hirt \u2013 Citi","And with billion of share repurchases completed in the first quarter with that accelerated buyback, and only 1 billion left to complete your 2 billion target for the year. Would you consider tapping into the additional 3 billion that you have authorized at some point this year?","Nick Fanandakis","Right now we\u2019re on track proceeding very well to complete as you say the 2 billion this year. We actually will complete the first half of that or little more than the first half of that by the end of second quarter. Although by the end of the first quarter we had already retired about 13 million shares so significant amount was done in the first quarter but the total first half or little more than first half won't be complete until the end of the second quarter and then we will look to put in place for the second half of the year, our steps to complete the last billion and fulfill our commitment of the 2 billion in the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","","This is actually Nielsen out [ph] for Bob. In Safety and Protection you said there is some softness in the public sector, a number of companies have called for some recovery with greater infrastructure and non-residential spending in the back half. Are you seeing something similar?","Ellen Kullman","On the public sector one that I saw every time I try to call it I call it wrong but what we\u2019re doing there is with new applications and new functionality to help with that, right? Because the public sector needs a reason to change or to replace or to expand and certainly additional protection and things like that. Now we\u2019re seeing the slowness in the U.S, Europe is still going very well especially on thermal protection and things like that. So we\u2019re seeing very different markets around the world and we\u2019re expecting improvement. As we take a look at garments, we\u2019re seeing second quarter is going to be stronger and so I think we\u2019re seeing that but I\u2019m always little hesitant to declare victory in the public market because you just never know what\u2019s going to happen.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on the ethylene cracker outage are you seeing an opportunity there to maybe squeeze out more capacity or work some debottlenecks during the maintenance?","Ellen Kullman","We have squeezed just about everything we can out of this turnaround and our focus right now is more on getting it back up and running because coming out of these round around\u2019s is never for the faint of heart and we can bring it up a day early or three days early that\u2019s real volume and that we can use this year. So we have got that focused on time because it has been closure to seven years and six years on this turnaround and we just got to get it opened up the planning, the guy is doing a great job as far as the front end loading of this turnaround and our goal, I\u2019ve got that team under a lot of incentive to overachieve on the time thing. I think we would have the biggest benefit to us this year."," ","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","In developed Europe what was your growth excluding the AG segment if you can just give us a sense for what you\u2019re seeing in those markets?","Ellen Kullman","Well AG group in Europe and so Nick?","Nick Fanandakis","Well, developed Europe in total is about 9% growth year-over-year from a revenue perspective.","Ellen Kullman","Yes and so what we saw was growth in Europe in AG along with I think most of our segments grew in Europe and try to think -- maybe electronics didn\u2019t because there is not much business.","Jim Borel","Yes but AG was up about the same as the whole overall region was. I would say that if you exclude that it doesn\u2019t really change the number in the region, it's still going to be above that 9% sort of number.","Ellen Kullman","Yes I mean the biggest drivers for Europe were automotive and our performance materials business and TiO2 was a strong quarter in our performance chemicals segment.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","And then on the enzyme side you have had some announcements during the quarter in the detergents area, do you expect to be gaining a significant amount of share in that business over the next couple of years or how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up?","Ellen Kullman","I think that\u2019s one where it's share is hard because the markets growing and changing because for instance the new products that are coming out are allowing us to expand the footprint, right. So we\u2019re really well-positioned for growth. Our focus is on making sure we have the right capacity in the right places of the world to be able to deliver against it and I think the team has done a great job there. But we\u2019re looking at our applications to really expand utilization of enzymes as opposed to just kind of fight over the same space that exists today.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","I want to follow-up on performance materials, you said that that you\u2019re expecting the second quarter to be down modestly given the turnaround but I would have thought that with the new Nike Golf ball that would more than offset that. I mean it's very exciting news.","Ellen Kullman","Frank I want to know whether you have tried the golf balls or not yet?","Nick Fanandakis","Frank, not everyone uses golf balls around us as we might.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","","Sure. Look I know weather demand hurt the quarter but it certainly hurt my golf game as well so I\u2019m looking forward to trying it out absolutely. Just on the turnaround, do you have an order of magnitude as to how much you expect that\u2019s going to impact the quarter? What sort of order of magnitude that would be?","Ellen Kullman","If you look at it from a top line basis the ethylene outage reduces are segment sales of few percent in the second quarter and that\u2019s in our guidance so that\u2019s already put into our forecast going forward.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","And obviously the balance sheet is very strong and you talked about how different the company is going to look in the second half of 2015. Might the company look a little bit different driven by M&A and how would you characterize the M&A environment and opportunities in Europe owing as to participate at the present time.","Nick Fanandakis","So Frank we\u2019re always looking at M&A opportunities in the company. We\u2019re very selective about where we look though as you know, we want to look at things that reinforce the strategic priorities, the directions we\u2019re going in. We will continue to be looking for M&A opportunities that will enhance our technology position, our market access, those types of things and we have very rigorous and hurdles that we have from a financial performance perspective that we\u2019re going to require of acquisition opportunities but it's something that we\u2019ve always look at and we will continue to look at. The strength of the balance sheet is certainly a positive on that but the balance sheet has always been in place and for quite some years now as you know where we have and enjoy this single A rating and even during the Danisco acquisition we were able to maintain that single A rating during that time period after 7 billion.","So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as the deciding factor on M&A is just going to be the balance sheet and the strength of it. It's something we\u2019re looking at all the time Frank.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","All right so you can maintain this position of being underlevered for the foreseeable future in addition, I mean obviously you got the share buyback as a use of cash and your dividends and so forth but we could see this condition continue for the foreseeable future of your being underlevered."," Nick Fanandakis","Well you say underlevered and so obviously you\u2019ve to -- if you\u2019re looking at just the debt EBITDA sort of thing you might come to a conclusion of underlevered when you adjust the debt and you add in that pension on funded piece I feel we\u2019re in the right place from a leverage standpoint, that pension liability can change as you saw it changed last year by about $5 billion that can change with a discount rate changes. So we will continue to evaluate those situations and we will take the appropriate actions depending on what external forces and how they are impacting us.","Ellen Kullman","Frank, since it's Nick's birthday today I think that you should make sure you reinforce his point of view on that.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo","Well that\u2019s fantastic Nick I will send you a sleeve of Nike Golf balls in honor of your birthday. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Just wanted to ask a bit about your kind of acreage expectations. I get corn acre is going down and Brazil is a headwind because the soya offset isn't that much but as we think about if there are going to be issues in the Ukraine and I would love to get sort of a greater characterization of what you think is going to go on there in terms of what the plant and how it will get financed and if you can participate in that but if they do indeed do fewer corn acres there is your expectation that they are going to get made up in the U.S. or other parts of Europe or do you just think those get lost this year and there is no sale opportunity?","Jim Borel","There are several pieces to that, so first of all in the Ukraine it's very difficult to predict what\u2019s going to end up happening there but because of the political situation but we\u2019re seeing some reduction in corn because of credit issues but also some delays and possible reductions just because of uncertainty among farmer. So and Ukraine is last year it was only a few percent of our global sales but it's really an important growth opportunity. We opened the plant in Stasi early last year. We\u2019re setup well for growth there. So certainly it's our hope that stability returns and we expect that to be a good market overtime.","The reductions in corn acres or hectares in Latin America and also in what we\u2019re expecting will happen in North America are likely gone for now. We will see what happens in the second happen both in terms of corn prices, what that does to restimulate demand et cetera but it's really way too early to know what the South America production will look like in the second half of the year until we get through the North America season.","Operator","And our next question is from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS","","Nick I hate to ask you a tax question on your birthday, you said you\u2019re taking a fresh start look. I think your approach to integrating global taxes and hedging exchange gains and losses is kind of unique, I think it came in actually with the Conoco acquisition a year ago. Is it a good time to take a fresh start, look at that approach?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, John we\u2019re going to look at a fresh start on a lot of different things. We\u2019re going to look at currency, local functional currency versus U.S. dollar functional. We\u2019re going to have a lot of things that we\u2019re going to explore as we make the spin here and look at the company as it stands in the future. So yes your touch on an area but trust me there are many areas that we\u2019re going to be exploring to drive simplification across the company which will help drive out some of the cost and would put us in extremely competitive position.","Carl Lukach","Thank you everyone. That concludes our call today. Our Investor Relations team will be available to answer any follow-up questions that you have.

My name is John, and I will be your conference operator for today's call. At this time, I would now like to welcome everyone to the DuPont First Quarter Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] To listen to the webcast, please go to www.dupont.com. Thank you. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you may begin.","Karen A. Fletcher","Thanks, John. Good morning, and welcome. With me this morning are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, CFO; and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President. The slides for today's call can be found in our website at dupont.com, along with the news release that was issued earlier today.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and ask that you refer to the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with the earnings news release and on our website. As a reminder, our comments on today's call regarding segment earnings are on an underlying basis. And finally, we've posted supplemental information on the website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance. ","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont delivered strong results in the first quarter in line with our expectations at a time when markets were mixed. ","Sales were up 12%, with 5% organic growth and 7% from acquisitions. We had excellent price performance in the quarter, driven in part by new product introductions, which were up more than 50% versus prior year. Not surprisingly, Pioneer had one of the largest year-over-year increases in its area. Productivity projects are tracking well across our businesses. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with very sharp execution, drove double-digit growth in sales and operating income this quarter. ","With respect to key markets, Agriculture is strong, with favorable farmer economics, increased corn acres in Europe and North America and outstanding momentum from our business in 2011 carrying into this year. Global auto builds were up 4% in the quarter, with North America builds up 17% according to the third-party market data that we used. ","In photovoltaics, we expect destocking to end in the second quarter, and the industry will resume a more balanced production schedule. Consumer electronics is improving, and growth is very much a function of new application introductions, such as next-generation smartphones and tablets. ","For industrial markets, our Performance Chemicals, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection segment volumes were down versus very strong comps in the prior year. Sequentially, volumes improved even when adjusting for seasonality now indicating -- I think this indicates a positive shift in momentum, and we anticipate these segments will return to year-over-year volume growth within the next 1 to 2 quarters. ","We continue to win in our markets through innovation. Our customers are benefiting from DuPont's valuable and meaningful product differentiation that enables them to serve their own end markets better. ","Here are just a couple of examples of DuPont's latest value-added innovations: an expanded offering of Optimum AcreMax insect-resistant corn hybrids for our farmers this season; and a next-generation metallized paste that improves efficiency of a solar module. And we've had overwhelming response to our recent introduction of Solamet PV17. ","I was in India last month and met with several customers, and I also had the chance to tour our research and development laboratories in Hyderabad and the newest DuPont innovation center in Pune. Like our other innovation centers, this one engages our customers and allows our teams to truly engage in meaningful product and design opportunities to help differentiate them in their markets. And in turn, DuPont's rewarded with a premium market position and greater customer loyalty. ","What you should take away from the first quarter is that we're off to a good start for the year. We expected slow sequential improvement, and that is what we're seeing. DuPont's well positioned in our markets, and we're executing with focus and discipline. Despite challenging conditions in certain markets, we delivered 12% growth in operating income this quarter. ","I'm now going to turn the call over to Nick for more detail on the quarter, and then I'll elaborate on my expectations for the year ahead. Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont delivered a record first quarter, with underlying earnings per share of $1.61. Our strong performance reflects discipline and focus on innovation, productivity and differential management in spite of volatile macro conditions. ","I'd like to review the details of the quarter, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of sales and earnings results. Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased over $250 million or 12%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, higher pension costs and a decrease in pharmaceuticals income. Excluding pharmaceuticals income, this is the 10th consecutive quarter that we've been able to deliver double-digit increases, and this outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio. ","Underlying earnings of $1.61 per share increased 6% compared to $1.52 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.10 of headwinds relating to taxes and exchange gains and losses. Consolidated net sales of $11.2 billion were up 12% versus the prior year. Local selling prices were up 8%, with increases in all regions and all segments, reflecting our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added another 7% to sales. ","Volume was down 2% from the near peak level in the first quarter of 2011. This decline is consistent with the market environment that Ellen just described. Sequentially, volumes improved, indicating a positive shift in momentum as we head into the second quarter. An example of this is in China, where volumes grew each month during the first quarter. Even with the Chinese Lunar New Year, volumes were up approximately 10% versus the fourth quarter, and we expect this positive trend to continue into the second quarter. ","Now let's turn to a corporate view of the first quarter, looking at EPS analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.45 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, this was the ninth consecutive quarter in which we successfully implemented price increases on a year-over-year basis. Excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes, first quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up 7% versus last year's first quarter. ","This cost increases have moderated from the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 3% versus our previous assumptions of 4%. The one percentage point improvement is primarily a result of lower natural gas and ethane cost, along with a more advantageous mix of ores in our titanium dioxide business. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.01 per share. ","Let's move to fixed cost, which reduced earnings by $0.20 per share, excluding volume, currency and portfolio changes. This was mainly driven by actions in the first quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in ag, higher cost associated with operating our annual Kevlar plant at Cooper River and TiO2 capacity expansions, as well as R&D and specific marketing initiatives. These investments and the available capacity at the -- at a time when existing plants provide us with ample opportunity for growth and further penetration in the marketplace. I'd also like to note that the $0.20 includes a $0.04 higher non-cash pension cost. ","Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we delivered approximately $100 million of fixed cost productivity in the first quarter. We're well on our way to delivering against our commitment of $300 million for the full year. Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind for the full year. For the second quarter, the stronger dollar is anticipated to be about an $0.08 headwind versus prior year. ","Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a $0.07 benefit. Although this does primarily reflect the acquisition of Danisco, it also includes a couple of smaller divestitures and acquisitions that were made to further enhance the strength of our portfolio. Speaking of Danisco, I want to just take a moment to give a quick update on how pleased I am with the status of the integration. We continue to make excellent progress with respect to the cost and revenue synergies that we had targeted. And I always knew that Danisco had exceptional science capabilities. However, I recently had the chance to see this firsthand when I visited Genencor's R&D facility in Palo Alto. And let me say, I came away very impressed with the facility, the energy of the scientists and the projects that are currently being developed within the R&D pipeline. After that visit, I have become even more enthusiastic about the potential of the combined businesses and the innovations that we can expect in the future. ","Turning back to the waterfall chart, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. Our goal is to achieve 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, there was volatility in exchange rates, coupled with the cost of coverage, which created a reduction in earnings during the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the exact impact that our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate. ","Income tax on the EPS waterfall was a $0.06 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate this quarter of 23.9% versus 21.3% last year. As expected, the increase in the base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the absence of R&D and other tax credits which expired at the end of 2011. We continue to expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be 23%. ","Lastly, Other on the waterfall shows a negative $0.06 variance, including a $0.02 headwind from reduced pharmaceutical royalties. First quarter pharma income of $27 million was in line with our expectations, and we're still estimating full year 2012 pharma income to be about $50 million, which represents about a $240 million decline from 2011. ","There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. We delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 15% in the first quarter led by growth in Agriculture. ","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $2.2 billion versus an outflow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This change was primarily due to the $500 million cash contribution to the U.S. principal pension plan that was made in January of this year. ","At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis first quarter '11, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 5 percentage points, excluding the Danisco impact, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity for the full year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A\/A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that. ","Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. We paid our 430th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Additionally, in the first quarter, the company initiated a $400 million share repurchase program, which will be completed no later than May. This program begins to tap into the $2 billion share repurchase plan that was approved by the board last year. ","In summary, for the first quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one and played out as we had expected. Global volume for the company declined on a year-over-year basis but improved sequentially. In spite of challenging market conditions, we delivered double-digit increases in underlying total segment PTOI, which is a testament to our portfolio diversity, pricing discipline and productivity focus. ","Turning now to the second quarter. We expect a strong finish to the northern hemisphere planting season. Additionally, we expect the sequential volume growth we experienced in the first quarter to continue, particularly in PV, consumer electronics, TiO2 and automotive markets. Jim and Karen will provide more details when they cover the individual segments. ","For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 per share, excluding significant items. The midpoint of our full year earnings guidance suggest we will grow earnings by 12% over the remaining 3 quarters, and we are well positioned to do just that. We continue to expect slow sequential movement against a backdrop of dynamic markets. The businesses affected by these dynamic conditions are taking actions in a variety of ways to mitigate the effects, including reducing expenditures and tightly managing cash. ","Our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to changing demand signals and to continue to service those customer needs. We remain focused on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in the business plans and in our ability to execute against those plans. ","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jim to review the Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. Jim?","James C. Borel","Thanks, Nick. The Agriculture segment posted a great first quarter underpinned by strong northern hemisphere commercial performance and favorable corn market dynamics. Our teams delivered growth in every region around the world as our footprint continues to expand at an impressive pace. ","On Slide 7, you'll see that sales grew 16% to $4.1 billion, with 8% price and 8% volume gains. Earnings were up 18% to $1.3 billion on higher volume and prices, more than offsetting the input cost increases, unfavorable currency impact and continued growth investments. ","Starting with seed sales, first quarter reached $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Corn sales growth in North America was the leading contributor, coupled with impressive results from an early strong start in Europe and robust Brazil Safrinha corn season sales. Specifically in North America, our direct sales teams are working closely with our customers to ensure the highest level of service, which continues to be a competitive advantage. And in a dynamic ag market like we're experiencing, it provides even more differentiation. Our new product ramp-ups of the Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge products, along with Optimum AQUAmax technology hybrids, are on track, contributing to our net price gains as customers increase their use of these higher value end-use products. ","In soybeans, the USDA is forecasting lower acres year-over-year. And despite this fact, we'll grow our soybean sales in 2012, continuing to lead the market rate based on the confidence that customers have in our disease packages and our overall product performance. ","In addition to executing a great North American sales season, we received regulatory approval for our Optimum AcreMax XTreme integrated and reduced refuge insect-protection product. XTreme has dual mode of action above- and below-ground insect control for extended trade durability, with a 5% integrated refuge. This year, we're preparing IMPACT Plots that demonstrate our Optimum AcreMax XTreme product, and we'll be selling it commercially in 2013. Our line of AcreMax products gives us the range of product options we need to extend our position with a robust product lineup of integrated and reduced refuge products providing growers with added convenience. ","Turning to our European seed business, increased corn sales reflect our ability as market leader to capture growth when presented with an early start to the season and timing differences favoring the first quarter. We've been making investments in our business operations, both in research and production in Central and Eastern Europe, extending our leadership position and accelerating our progress in this important growing region. Our leading market position confirms we're making the right growth investment choices. ","And finally, our corn performance in the Brazil Safrinha season was outstanding. Safrinha corn crop, as you know, is smaller in value versus that of the summer season, but it continues to grow each year in both hectares and technology adoption and therefore, value. From a product perspective, our Herculex I products are quickly penetrating our product lineup because of their excellent insect protection, particularly against fall armyworm. ","And to further extend trade durability in our lineup, we'll be launching Optimum Intrasect insect protection products, which offers dual-mode above-ground insect protection. Based on our strong business model, we anticipate building our early success in 2012 and delivering strong summer season performance later this year. ","Turning to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter of $929 million grew 7%, with both volume and price gains. The results reflect particular strength in the insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The success of Rynaxypyr supports our investment efforts to quickly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatments to the market. ","As a status update, we're on track for a second half 2012 introduction of Cyazypyr in Asia Pacific, and we'll be introducing Dermacor seed treatment in the Mexican core market. While the 2012 launches are small, the target is large, and we believe the franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry family will grow to $1 billion over the next few years. ","Looking ahead to the second quarter for the Agriculture segment, we expect mid-teens percent sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth compared to the same period's previous year. This reflects strong business performance in the early start to the season, which added about $0.03 per share to the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter. ","The seed business anticipate a strong finish to the North American and European planting seasons. Crop Protection expects a very strong second quarter as farmers are incented to protect their crops and maximize their yield. Also considered in our updated outlook are input cost increases in the seed business, currency headwinds and growth investments. ","In summary, the ag segment laid out many proof points by which to measure success in 2012, and we're well on track or exceeding our commitments, which include segment sales growth at the upper end or slightly above our long-term compound annual growth rate guidance of 8% to 10%. ","In seed, we targeted net price gains in seed between 5% and 10% as our customers validate our value propositions product by product. The ramp-up of our Optimum AcreMax family of integrated and reduced refuge insect protection products, the regulatory approval of Optimum AcreMax XTreme and continued growth of our international businesses in corn, soybeans, sunflowers and canola. ","Turning to Crop Protection, we estimated the market would grow 4% to 6%, and that our growth would outpace the market based on contribution from both volume and price gains and from a product perspective, the continued expansion of Rynaxypyr and the registration approvals and launches of sister products, Cyazypyr and Dermacor seed treatment and finally, the expansion of a novel weed control mode of action into land management. Consistently delivering against our commitments is important. And with our strategies firmly in place, our new product launches lined up, we believe achieving our growth objectives comes down to execution, and our teams continue to execute very well. ","Now turning to Slide 8, reviewing our Nutrition & Health segment, which includes the Health and Protection, Enablers and Solae businesses. Sales of $808 million were up $484 million, with earnings of $83 million reflecting both the integration and positive cost synergy benefit of the Danisco Specialty Food Ingredients acquisition. The results posted show progress on the segments' key goals. ","First is our focus within Solae, to mix enrich by growing the high-value specialty soy products. In line with our business objectives, double-digit sales growth in specialty was offset by a decline in the soy commodity side. The quality of earnings is improving as we enrich the mix and drive productivity in our Solae operations. ","The second goal is aligned with driving our acquisition targets. Legacy Danisco businesses achieved price gains as they continued to deliver new applications in the arena of nutrition and functional food solutions, improved health and food protection. With respect to cost synergies, the quarter reflects progress delivering cost synergies and productivity gains: leveraging DuPont operations and global sourcing capabilities, as examples. This demonstrated performance gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our 2012 synergy goals. ","Pretax operating margin for the segment hit 10%, up sequentially, reflecting the progress we're making on our key goals. And moving to the outlook for the second quarter, we expect sales in the combined segment in the range of $820 million to $860 million, with portfolio impact, as well as organic growth from all segments. Earnings growth will be underpinned by higher sales and cost synergies offset in part by raw material inflation. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Karen for an update on the remainder of the segments.","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Let's move to Electronics & Communications on Slide 9. Segment sales of $677 million decreased 17% on lower volumes. Price was up 1%, primarily due to metals pass-through. While sales were down in Asia and Europe on a year-over-year basis, we saw photovoltaic module inventories starting to normalize. Our PV sales were up sequentially as our newest Solamet offerings are doing very well in the marketplace, attracting much interest from Tier 1 producers. ","Turning to consumer electronics, demand was mixed overall but particularly robust in tablet PCs and smartphones, given recent new product launches by our customers. PTOI of $33 million was down substantially, as expected, given the volume declines and lower plant utilization experienced in the quarter. Looking to second quarter, we expect sales to be down moderately and PTOI down substantially versus very strong comps. ","On a sequential basis, we see sales up significantly and PTOI up substantially as photovoltaic and consumer electronics markets continue to improve. We continue to expect PV module installations to grow about 10% for the year, with strong demand for products like DuPont Solamet and Tedlar. ","Moving to Slide 10, we'll talk about Industrial Biosciences. Sales of $288 million and PTOI of $41 million were driven primarily by last year's Genencor acquisition, with strong performance in our enzymes offering. This includes Axtra XAP, our newest animal nutrition product line, which is being very well received in the poultry market place. Likewise, our enzymes for grain processing are gaining traction in Asia, where high fructose corn syrup is not well-penetrated in the beverage market. ","For the second quarter, sales are expected to range between $290 million and $320 million as the year-over-year benefit due to acquisition comes to an end. PTOI margins will be low-double digits. We see continued growth in enzymes, where our products are clearly differentiated based on our science, for example, in animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, on the biomaterial side, we see Sorona increasingly gaining adoption in carpeting. ","Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were up 6% due to 16% higher price offsetting 10% lower volume. TiO2 demand was strongest in North America, with Asia demand stabilizing and destocking coming to an end. Although TiO2 volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth in all markets. Industrial chemicals demand was favorable due to strong performance from aniline and cyanide. Overall, PTOI was up 30% as strong pricing and our industry-leading productivity more than mitigated cost increases and lower volumes in both businesses. ","In the second quarter, we expect sales up modestly. Our leading indicators and demand signals suggest an improvement in demand for all major regions consistent with seasonality and general economic stabilization. PTOI is expected to be up moderately versus strong comps with an ongoing productivity focus. ","Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased 6% due to higher selling prices in all regions and all market segments. OEM volume was up, particularly in North America where auto builds increased by 17%, and there was continued strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market. Offsetting these increases was a decline in refinish volume, primarily in Southern Europe, resulting from uncertain macro conditions there. ","PTOI of $87 million increased 34% with 170 basis point margin expansion. These increases were the result of pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains partially offset by higher raw material cost. ","For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up slightly and earnings up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year. Auto builds are forecast to be up 10% to 12% in the second quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up 5% to 6%. This segment continues to implement pricing and mix enrichment actions while driving productivity gains that improve margins. ","Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Sales were down 6%, primarily due to 10% lower volume, partially offset by higher selling prices of 6%. Automotive-related demand improved, particularly in North America. This was more than offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe. ","Packaging markets remain stable. Although volume was down on a year-over-year basis, we saw sequential growth versus fourth quarter. PTOI was down $48 million or about 17% on lower volume. ","For the second quarter, we expect sales down slightly with continued sequential growth. As a reminder, global auto builds are expected to grow 10% to 12%. Packaging demand will remain stable, and electronics and industrial markets are expected to improve sequentially but down versus prior year. PTOI is expected to be up moderately, primarily due to lower ethane costs. ","On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 2% due to lower volume resulting from continued softness in industrial markets, partially offset by higher selling prices. PTOI was down $45 million or 31%, principally due to lower volume and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar Cooper River plant. I would like to note that customer qualifications at the new plant are proceeding as scheduled. ","For the second quarter, sales and PTOI are expected to be up slightly with continued improvement in North American demand. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, like Kevlar AP, Kevlar XP and Kevlar KM2 Plus, for industrial and ballistic applications are being well received in the market. These products utilize the new technology we've installed at our Cooper River plant. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement for Nomex, particularly in the auto and energy solution markets, and in Tyvek for consumer applications. ","This concludes the segment updates, and I'll now turn the call back to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen. As Nick stated, today we are reaffirming our full year guidance of $4.20 $4.40 per share or 7% to 12% growth. We've had a couple of challenging quarters, but we're now seeing encouraging signs in our markets. Destocking is ending in photovoltaics, consumer electronics and automotive plastics. Essentially, all of our industrial businesses saw volume improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Now keep in mind that first and second quarters last year were extremely strong and make for tough year-over-year comps. We expect sequential volume again improvement in the second quarter. ","Moving to the regions. Asia demand is recovering from the slowdown that we saw in the fourth quarter with gradually improvement throughout the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. While many European markets remain weak, a couple of exceptions are Agriculture and certain auto exports. The good news is that we don't see conditions deteriorating for our industrial businesses. Jim spoke about the strong year we're delivering in Agriculture. You've heard about the powerful combination of attractive farmer economics, strong product performance coming from rich R&D pipelines in seeds and Crop Protection and an advantage route-to-market in our seed business. ","And I would be remiss not to mention productivity, which continues to be core to every business in DuPont. And I'm particularly proud of our Coatings business, which has had an unwavering focus on productivity over the last few years. Last year, the bottom line impact of productivity was matched by a dramatically higher raw material cost. And the coatings team took pricing actions during the second half of '11, made some tough portfolio decisions and never let up on productivity. So I'm very pleased to see the margin expansion this quarter of 170 basis points, and I look forward to the business sustaining and further expanding those margins through the rest of the year. ","So in closing, it's about execution, staying close to customers to understand underlying demand signals and anticipating an inflection point in demand like the ones we're seeing in photovoltaics; delivering value through new products, like our Optimum AcreMax family of corn hybrids, or the pending launch of Cyazypyr insecticides; [indiscernible] developing new product applications on a very localized basis for our innovation centers; and delivering on our productivity targets. We are well positioned for continued recovery in growth through differentiated offerings and a global footprint, and we remain confident in meeting our targets and delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders. ","So Karen, back to you.","Karen A. Fletcher","Great. Thank you, Ellen. And John, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from John, I'm sorry -- Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, question -- 2 questions on ag, actually. Or one plus one follow-up. On the seed front, is your expectation for your share gains and volume gains based on the USDA plant and acreage assumption of 95.9 million acres, which should be about, I guess, a 4.5% increase in the overall market in the U.S.? And then just to follow-up on Crop Protection, we had a pretty mild winter. Some people are thinking that, that could lead to significant weed and insect infestation. And does that cause you to be more optimistic in terms of the overall volume outlook for that business as we get into second quarter?","James C. Borel","Thanks, Don. First on the seed, yes, the -- we're expecting share gains in corn based on the USDA estimate of 96 million. And our progress so far, the order books and early deliveries are supporting our expectation there, so that's correct. And on the Crop Protection side, certainly, we're expecting a strong second quarter in Crop Protection over the remainder of the year, really. And it's based on a number of things, both what we've got coming from the pipeline of products, but also the season. And as you know, farmers have a real incentive to maximize production. So if we have additional pest pressure, that only gives us more support.","Operator","And our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","One question on guidance. I guess, I'm a little curious as to why you elected not to increase the low end of guidance after such a strong quarter. Was there some sales pulled into 1Q from Q2, in your opinion, beyond what Jim had outlaid? And another question, on the Evonik plant disruption, and can you provide a little bit more clarity on products you already have in the market and how quickly volume could be ramped to meet demand if a suitable replacement can be found?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so as far as the guidance goes, we've provided that guidance to you in December. We didn't change it in January when we saw headwinds, currency and tax and things like that. It's early in the year. I think that we're really want to see a little more beyond the second quarter before we would change that, and so we elected to keep it the same. But we, obviously, as you pointed out, have got a strong start to the year. As far as the Evonik situation goes, we don't have a drop-in product. So there would need to be work done, either in Delrin or Zytel, depending on which of the polymers would be relevant to the application. And that's why we've got our application development people and our sales people out with each of the OEMs that are impacted to really understand if we can help out. I think the timing depends on the qualifications for the OEMs and the specific applications, so we'll have more on that as time goes on.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike (sic) [Mark] Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So the first question is on Safety & Protection. The margins there are still low versus your low-double-digit goal. Obviously, you've got commercial construction headwinds, the Kevlar expansion, but housing is getting better. So I'm just wondering, do you need just a stronger macro environment sort of GDP to hit this target or is there a way to get there without it?","Ellen J. Kullman","Mark, I think it's a combination. I think it's a combination of the external factors you discussed. I think it's also the qualifications off of the new plant. I mean, we invested quite a bit of money in the Kevlar plant in Cooper River, and those qualifications are obviously coming along. We're very pleased with where they are, but there's a burden that comes along with that until we get through that. Between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we're up about 100 basis points, and we expect that to see continued improvement sequentially as we come through the year.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up, on ag R&D, you had been spending a chunk of that money on regulatory improvements internally. Is that still true in Q1 and will that be true going through 2012?","James C. Borel","Yes, we continue to strengthen our regulatory efforts, as well as with increased products coming through the pipeline. That brings with it some additional cost. That's not the only increase by any stretch. In fact, the majority is going into basic product discovery and development. But yes, it is a piece of it as we ramp up our pipeline.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, just to follow up on ag. How much of the 20% growth -- sales growth in seeds would you attribute to volume versus price? And then second, would you care to characterize or quantify any potential timing benefits in either North America or Europe related to the early season here?","James C. Borel","First, both seed and Crop Protection had both price and volume gains. And for the segment, it was 8% volume and about 8% price, so it was a combination of both. Global seed net-net, we'll deliver -- we expect between 5% and 10% net price. North America will be at the upper end of that range based on what we see today. And let's see, your second question was -- what was your second question? Seems like there was a second piece, I'm sorry -- Kevin, was there a second piece to your question?","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I was wondering, Jim, whether or not you experienced any favorable timing issues with regard to a potential pull-forward of sales in either North America or Europe given early planting?","James C. Borel","Thanks, Kevin. Yes, there was an early start, strong start to the European season, a little bit in North America as well, but particularly Europe, we're positioned well for that. As I mentioned earlier, about $0.03 a share is what I would estimate. We'll know more clearly once we get through the second quarter. But certainly, it was some pull-forward but not significant.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Lucy Watson on for Laurence today. Ellen, you mentioned in your comments that you expect a year-over-year volume growth to flip to positive in the next 2 quarters. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on how you see this progressing through your businesses from, I guess, more of an overall perspective. Or I guess another way to word it, is there a checklist of items you're expecting to hit certain inflection points, such as that midyear recovery in the photovoltaics market? Or how are you thinking about reaching that inflection point?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so I think we have to -- the thing is, you have to take it sort of industry-by-industry to understand it. In photovoltaics, we're looking at what everybody believes to be about a 10% increase in global installs this year. Inventories were at about 1\/2 of what they were in the third and fourth quarter, and we're seeing things like the Solamet paste volume increase. Now part of that is due to our innovation and our new product, PV17A, which is really being consumed in great quantities by solar manufacturers. It's just tremendous from an efficiency standpoint. Part of it is recovery. And so when we -- we see if that happens, destocking ending in the second quarter and coming out to about 10% a year. So I think what we see there is the progression. If you look at DTT, again, we see sequential month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter improvement in volumes around the globe. That comes from a variety of different industries. Not only construction, but also in industrial and plastics and things like that. And if you look at auto, I think that's going to be a key one this year, it was up 4% in the first quarter, but it was hugely different by country. The U.S. in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter was up some 17%, but China was down 4%. Now overall, the second quarter, we see China is going to be up tremendously. And whether those numbers -- and we think globally, second quarter looks like it's north of 10% growth in the second quarter for automotive. So I think as we take a look at the quarterly progression of these industries, as we take a look at what we're seeing in some of our products that kind of go in on the front-end, like the paste does on the production of a cell, that we're feeling very much like that slow sequential improvement will continue as far as we can see out into the future.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on Safety & Protection. As you bridge the gaps towards your margin targets, assuming that macro is not within your control, so keeping with other initiatives, I guess, what would be a reasonable estimate for the margin benefit you should get from qualifications at the new Kevlar plant?","Ellen J. Kullman","Okay. Well, Nick, why don't you deal with that one?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes, sure. When we talk about the long-term targets for this business, this segment being in the 21% to 23% sort of margin area, when you look at this facility, the additional capacity we added, the new product offering that we have in this segment, you're looking at something that's going to play out over the next 18 to 20 months to sell out that facility. So you're going to see this gradual margin improvement. We're confident were going to reach our long-term targets of the 21% to 23%, but this will play out over time as that capacity continues to be fully utilized at that site.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the TiO2 front. I know that you guys are pretty much running flat out a year ago so not that surprising to see the volumes off, but you specifically mentioned Asia being a bit weaker. Can you talk about the -- can you compare and contrast the volume trends by region? I would have thought that North America would have been pretty strong given the weather situation and the strong start to the coating season here. So a little more color on that would be helpful.","Ellen J. Kullman","I think what we've seen, Frank, is sequential improvement around the world. I mean, I think it's pretty much played out the way we discussed it in our January call. The fundamentals are still there. High-quality pigment is still being -- is in demand. And as we see the markets progress, we're seeing that improvement. Second quarter is the big North American quarter for pigment. The first quarter is seasonally their lowest quarter. But as we take a look month-by-month, it's improving. If we take a look from the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, it's improving, and we are seeing that globally.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Also on TiO2 -- and Nick, you mentioned an advantageous mix of ores in the quarter and for the full year. Can you provide some color as to what are your ore costs up year-over-year and how that might impact year-over-year earnings in this business for 2012?","Ellen J. Kullman","So we have an advantaged position in our manufacturing process capability in that when we need to produce more, we can change the ore blend and produce more. If we're producing less, we can take our ore blend down, reduce our cost, still operate the plants at high utility and lower our cost as we come through there. So that kind of capability allows us to really optimize our performance from that. I mean, we expect to have lower cost than our plan was for 2012 because of being able to operate with these lower ore blends. And for the full year, our margin target is on track, and we had -- viewed that as being flat from that standpoint. And so we're right on track from where we've been talking.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Brian Maguire on for Bob this morning. Just a follow-up on the Evonik situation. Just wondering if you source any CDT for your own specialty resins in that segment? And also, we've been hearing some chatter from the auto OEM guys that they may have to curtail some of their productions because of lack of supply of the PA-12 resin. Are you hearing that from your customers too, and is there any risk to your global auto builds numbers in your guidance assumptions?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, obviously, we took a hard look at all our supply chains, and we don't foresee any supply disruptions at this time to our products as a result of this unfortunate event. We were out talking to industry about that and committed to them that we'll expend our efforts and time to collaborate with them to find alternatives so that they can minimize the supply disruption. So obviously, it's unfortunate that this has happened, but we've got a great relationship with the OEMs. We're very deep on the research and development side with them and are working very closely with them to see if we can help offset some of their shortfalls from other suppliers in the industry.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It looks like you're obviously pacing well against your cost productivity estimates for the year and also on the synergies with Danisco. Can you give us a sense on how those should trend over the balance of the year and what the potential is for maybe exceeding those numbers?","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes, as you said, we're we on track to achieving our targets. We had set $300 million of fixed cost productivity and $300 million of working capital productivity. And in the first quarter, we were approximately $100 million for each one of those. So you can see that we're well on track to meeting or potentially exceeding. From the cost energy standpoint, we've talked about this before, that $130 million of cost synergies is what the anticipation was with Danisco. And when we originally were talking about it, we were talking about it in 2013. And as we've mentioned in prior calls, we've accelerated that, and we're now going to realize that full savings of $130 million in 2012. And if you look at the Danisco in aggregate, it's tracking well in -- from a margin perspective -- the pieces that we acquired, not only in Nutrition & Health, but in IB as well. So we're seeing very positive results and very happy with the speed at which we're realizing the synergies that we had projected.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to address the Asian weakness in volumes. Could you break it down a little differently how much of the Asian weakness was from electronics and TiO2?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so you're -- I'm sorry, you're kind of breaking up there. So the question is about volumes and specifically Asia and how much of that was TiO2? It was electronics, it was performance polymers and TiO2 were the 3 big revenue areas in Asia. So those would be the 3 I'd look at, P.J.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your SG&A costs were up 14% year-over-year and your sales were up 12%. And most chemical companies really try to keep their SG&A growth lower than their sales growth. Did you accrue from management compensation at above average level? Or -- why are your SG&A costs so high?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, actually, I'd like to start first to say we're not a chemical company, so I don't want to use that as a -- but we'll let Nick answer the question for you, Jeff.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","So when you look at our SG&A percent of sales, you can see a slight increase there. I think the biggest factor there is the addition of the Danisco acquisition that we have in place there with the additional cost that came on board there. And you also have the new products that we continue to drive and introduce across the portfolio but largely in the ag section as well. So I think those would be primary drivers of anything around the SG&A line item.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, it wouldn't have been affected by management cost at all because that was down year-over-year. But if you take a look at the -- we did not have Danisco in the first quarter last year and we had it this year, so it's just added in.","Operator","Our next question is from Edward Yang from Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Ellen, on TiO2, you sounded positive and you're looking for a recovery there, but wanted a clarification on the comment in Slide 11, where you mentioned destocking ending in Asia. Does that imply that you're seeing positive volumes now in Asia and restockings occurring or you're seeing destocking at a lower rate? We'd like some clarification there.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so I think it's about sequential. Because year-over-year, the first quarter and the second quarter last year were huge quarters. Right? And so if you look at sequentially how we've moved through the fourth quarter and ended the first quarter, we're seeing continued improvement. I think the number from first quarter versus fourth quarter was like up 10%. So I think that's a better view of it, and that's even considering there was Lunar New Year in the first quarter. So I think that's a better way to really understand how the volume is progressing as opposed to a year-over-year basis.","Operator","And our next question is from Andy Cash from UBS.","Andrew W. Cash - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jim, just a question on your ag space. The new acres in corn, like in the Kotas, these may or may not be sustainable in the long term. So I'm just curious, if Pioneers -- how much of Pioneers' going after that business? Is much of your seed volume growth this year tied to those new acres? Are you leaving that to the competition?","James C. Borel","We're participating there, as well as everywhere else. I wouldn't say that's a significant part of the growth, but we're positioned well where those acres grow. In fact, oftentimes, it's our genetics that are helping farmers be able to grow corn competitively in some of the marginal areas. So it's -- yes, it's a part of the growth but not a significant portion.","Operator","And our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions actually, one on Performance Chems. If we look over the last 5 years, Performance Chems sequentially from Q1 to Q2 has grown sales about 10% pretty consistently. And generally, that's led to a PTOI growth of about 25% sequentially. But kind in the guidance if you look at it, it looks like sales are going to do about the same thing this year, but PTOI doesn't look like it's going to grow its normal growth pattern sequentially. Can you kind of walk through what the puts and takes on that might be?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think if you take a look at it, our Performance Chemicals business is made up of a mix of a lot of different chemicals from cyanide to anilines, TiO2. And so there's a great mix effect that's in there. As you know, I guess, in the last year, the economics of TiO2 were very strong, and TiO2 was in short supply throughout the first half of the year. Now the market is moving a little sideways. It's continuing to progress. And so the mix of volume and price is different for each one of them, and that's what really contemplates or allows the difference among them. So it's very much a mix effect of the variety of products that are in there. We've said that the 2012 earnings growth will moderate but will still grow going forward.","Karen A. Fletcher","So John, I think we're about out of time. I want to respect our analysts' time, but I do want to give it back to Ellen for final closing comments.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen. So I want to thank you all for joining the call today. First, the Agriculture segment, obviously, an increasingly large part of our portfolio over the past several years, strong start with the northern hemisphere planting season, 16% sales growth in the segment, 18% earnings growth through our industry-leading products and services. Second, we're encouraged with sequential improvements for many of our industrial businesses in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. And even within the quarter, we experienced volume increases each month in most of our businesses. And we're well positioned with differentiated products, backed up by robust research and development pipelines. And our geographic footprint really allows us, combined with the innovation, to quickly capitalize on growth opportunities with our customers at a local level, which is where innovation happens. And so I think, finally, we are executing well. You've heard numerous examples today in our financial results, our new products successes and in productivity. And I think all of this supports our expectation of 7% to 12% earnings growth for the year. ","So we'll look forward to updating you throughout the year. And again, thank you very much for joining our call today."],"7486":["E.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Quarterly Investor Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period (Operator Instructions)","In the interest of time, management requests that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, and please pick up your handset to allow optimal sound quality. If you have additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. Thank you.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl, you may begin the conference.","Carl J. Lukach","Thank you. And good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's third quarter 2013 performance. Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO, and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The slides for today's presentation can be found on our website along with our news release. Please note that we also posted our third quarter segment performance slides and outlook commentary this morning.","During the course of this conference call we will make forward-looking statements. And I direct you to slide two for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website.","For today's agenda, Ellen will start with opening comments. Nick will review our third quarter financial performance and near term outlook. And I\u2019ll provide business segment insights. We\u2019ll conclude with Ellen\u2019s comment followed by your questions.","With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Carl, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to begin today by highlighting DuPont\u2019s third quarter performance. Our segment results were generally in line with our July expectations, double digit earnings improvements from Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications, Safety & Protection and Industrial Biosciences paired with ongoing productivity initiatives across the company helped to offset the expected earnings decline from our Performance Chemical segment.","Operating earnings of $0.45 per share were above our guidance due to a one point reduction in the annual tax rate, gains related to our Pannar acquisition and a joint venture asset both of which we expected in the fourth quarter. However, the strength of the dollar were greater headwinds than we expected.","As a result we realized a higher portion of the second half operating earnings in the third quarter in the 40% we anticipated in July. Third quarter net sales about $7.7 billion increased 5%, largely due to 9% higher volumes first at the week prior year.","As you may recall, more depository operating priorities is to drive growth in developing market. Against that metric, we delivered solid third quarter results. In developing Asia, we increased sales by 14% compared to last year\u2019s difficult economic environment. Our investments in Research and Development and marketing facing resources continue to pay strong dividends.","To illustrate that point, our Performance Materials business delivered 29% higher automotive sales volumes in China this quarter. This progress was due in part to insights from our innovation centers, our local application development capability and our customer focused teams.","We also delivered a 24% revenue increase in developing Europe, Middle East and Africa which was broad-based and aided by the acquisition of a controlling in script in Pannar Seed in Africa. This acquisition is another positive step to enhance agricultural productivity and improve total security while accelerating the development of higher performing products for Africa\u2019s farmers.","Looking more broadly the macroeconomic environment and in particular global industrial production is improving sequentially, but on a slower pace than we expected three months ago. As a result we recently lowered our global industrial production outlook for 2013 from 2.5% growth to slightly under 2%.","Despite the slow growth macroeconomic environment, we continue to capitalize on our unique scientific capabilities to develop differentiated high value solutions that respond to growing global market demand.","In summary, our strong and diverse global footprint positioned us well to deliver strong volume growth compared to last year and we\u2019re executing well against our strategic and operating priorities.","Nick will now explain in more detail our third quarter financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Thank you, Ellen and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Our operating earnings for the third quarter were $0.45 per share slightly better than expectations and $0.02 better than 2012. The improvement primarily reflects the acceleration of two events which were expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this year, and equity re-measurement gain related to the Pannar acquisition of about $0.03 per share and a benefit of about $0.02 per share relating to an asset revaluation in a joint venture. These positive items along with the benefit of a one point reduction in our full year base tax rates were some what tempered by a stronger U.S. dollar and the anticipated lower Performance Chemicals operating earnings of about $0.13 per share.","The lower Performance Chemical earnings are largely due to the decline in global TiO2 prices versus prior year. We are seeing clear signs that this market has stabilized and we are encouraged by the improving industry fundamentals. Consolidated net sales of $7.7 billion increased 5% versus the prior year. Volume increased 9% led by our Electronics & Communications, Performance Chemicals, and Agricultural segments, which each add double digit volume growth versus a weak third quarter last year.","On a sequential basis volumes were up only slightly compared with the second quarter. Local selling prices declined 3% primarily due to lower TiO2 and flour product prices and lower pass-through of precious metal costs in Electronics & Communications, partially offset by innovation driven price increases in our Agricultural segment.","Currency also had a negative 1% impact on our top line as the dollar continued to strengthen against most currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, and the Indian Rupee, partially offset by a weaker dollar versus the Euro.","For the full year, we now expect a negative $0.18 currency impact which is higher than our previous outlook of $0.12 to $0.14 because during the year the dollar has strengthened considerably versus every key currency except the Euro.","In addition to our business performance, our base tax rate for the quarter was seven points lower than last year, contributing $0.04 to operating EPS. For the full year, we now expect a base tax rate of about 22%.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 for more information regarding the Company sales by geographic region. In every region of the world, we had increased sales volumes. However, lower local prices were an offsetting factor. The decline in prices in the quarter generally reflected the impact of our Performance Chemicals businesses in the regions, particularly in developed Asia.","Our growth in developing EMEA reflects our acquisition of controlling interest in Pannar Seed, which significantly increased our footprint in South Africa during the quarter.","In the second quarter earnings call, we communicated our expectations that industrial markets would gradually recover. As Ellen noted, we still expect to see industrial production improvements, but they are coming at a slower pace. In the third quarter, we saw a growth in Europe and Japan after 2011 and 2012 recessions and we saw some positive signs of growth in China. Overall, we see the global economy improving, but slowly.","Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look into our operating earnings for the third quarter. Slide 5 provides a segment operating earnings variance analysis. From this waterfall chart, you can see clearly the large impacts of decline in Performance Chemical segment earnings had on our overall earnings compared to last year.","Operating earnings for Performance Chemicals declined $159 million this quarter, the $0.13 per share was in line with our expectations. Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications, Safety & Protection, and Industrial Biosciences each had strong performance and double-digit percent growth versus the prior year, offsetting much of the decline in Performance Chemicals segment earnings. Carl will cover more of our operating segment results in a few minutes.","Moving to Slide 6, in total, segment earnings were down $0.05 per share. Segment results include the Performance Chemicals decline we just covered and they also include $0.04 due to currency, which was higher than we anticipated. A change in the base tax rate expectation for the full year also provided a $0.04 benefit in the quarter. The $0.01 benefit from lower corporate expenses that you see on Slide 6 reflects this quarter savings from cost control in our business support functions and the restructuring program we announced last year.","We are on track to deliver the $300 million in savings we targeted for 2013. Beyond this restructuring program, we continue to execute ongoing cost productivity initiatives throughout all of our businesses. We are well on our way delivering on our commitment, but more than $300 million for the full year from these initiatives. In total, both initiatives will contribute significantly to offsetting inflation and helping to fund our growth investments.","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7, our current free cash flow is about $2 billion greater use of cash versus the prior year. As you know, cash flows are highly seasonable from our growing Ag segment and with sales up more than $1 billion in the segment this year, cash and working capital investments have increased to support that growth year-over-year. The timing of production grower compensation payments, which reflected higher contract commodity prices from last year and the timing of customer prepayments contributed to the working capital increases. The decline in Performance Chemicals earnings also had a negative impact on free cash flow versus last year.","Before I close, let me offer a few insights regarding our balance sheet and pensions. First, a reminder; maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides the financial flexibility to fund ongoing operations and compelling growth opportunities remains a key priority for DuPont. Second, our current unfunded pension balance is declining. Given today\u2019s rising interest rate environments and if all other pension related variables, which remain constant. Our unfunded pension liability should decline significantly by about $2 billion to $3 billion by year-end.","In summary, third quarter results were in line with our expectations and our lower base tax rate offset the currency headwinds. With these results we are today reaffirming our full year outlook of $3.85 per share. We expect an improved fourth quarter compared to last year\u2019s weak operating results and also anticipate that our Ag segment will have positive earnings, reflective of the seasonal shifts that Carl will discuss in more detail.","Additionally, our outlook also reflects a year-over-year currency headwind of about $0.07 per share and dials in a full year base tax rate of about 22%, lower than our previous assumption of 23% to 24%.","In closing, we have delivered strong results in the quarter and for the year. We will overcome more than $0.80 of headwinds due to Performance Chemicals earnings and currency. Our teams continue to execute well against our plans and we continue to create increased value for our shareholders. In the coming months we expect to deliver a strong finish to the year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Carl.","Carl J. Lukach","","Thanks, Nick. I\u2019d like to now provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides in the complete segment commentary are posted on the Investors in our website at dupont.com.","Please turn now to Slide 8 and let\u2019s begin with Agriculture segment. We feel great about our results and our performance in this competitive environment. Year-to-date we\u2019ve grown sales 12% and operating earnings 8% over last year\u2019s strong performance. Our right product, right acre strategy in seeds and our innovation focus is delivering value to customers.","In the third quarter sales grew 15% based on strong demand for our industry-leading insecticides and higher seed revenues. Our typical seasonal loss lower than last year as sales growth and a gain of $26 million from the Pannar Seed acquisition more than offset higher seed costs.","In crop protection, third quarter sales were up 21% with volume growth in Latin America led by strong demand for Rynaxypyr. Expectations for higher soybean hectares also drove demand for fungicides, particularly for picoxystrobin. Rynaxypyr continues to perform well and we are on pace to exceed $900 million in sales this year. Our fungicide portfolio also continues to show solid growth with the highly successful launch of approach our picoxystrobin fungicide product in the United States this year.","Moving to the seed business, we had a solid start to the Latin America sales season despite the negative impact of currency and growers reducing corn hectares in favor of soybeans. Pricing gains were led by the continued adoption of Intrasect, our dual-mode of action, insect protected hybrids which will represent about a third of our Brazil corn volume this year.","Likewise recent investments in soybeans are paying off as growers in Brazil are increasing demand for locally developed high yielding, high-quality pioneer brand soybeans. The USDA did not issue an October crop report and won\u2019t issue its final 2013 acreage report until January 2014. So it\u2019s too early to be definitive about market share. However, we are pleased with the competitive performance of the pioneer business growing sales 11% through the first three quarters based on the strength of price gains and higher corn volumes in North America.","Moving to the fourth quarter outlook for agriculture, we expect a substantial increase in sales on expectations of continued strong performance in both seeds and crop protection in Latin America. Earlier shipment of safrinha corn seed enabled by a recent investments in Brazil and really start to North America seed shipments and a benefit from including our Pannar acquisition.","As a result of sales increases in seeds, continued growth in crop protection and lower anticipated seed input costs for the fourth quarter North American sales we expect to achieve a small fourth-quarter profit in our Agricultural segment for the first time. For the full year, we now expect operating margins will be about flat over coming the impacts of the higher seed input costs earlier in the year.","Looking forward to 2014, we are watching closely corn and soybean markets and implications for the upcoming safrinha and Northern Hemisphere planting seasons. Several important events will play out between now and when growers put seed in the ground next spring in North America. Specifically, we will see the completion of the North American harvest this year, the harvest of the summer crop in South America and the planting of the safrinha corn in Brazil.","Turning to Electronics & Communications on Slide 9, the demand environment strengthened versus the prior year in photovoltaic and this was reflected in our improved results. Operating earnings increased 67% due primarily to higher demand for our Solamet and Tedlar materials in PV. Overall PV market fundamentals are gradually improving, module prices have been stable due to improved utilization rates and the settlement of trade disputes has provided a more stable environment.","Global PV demand continues to be led by China, Japan and the United States partially offset by lower demand in Europe. While the PV market is still challenged by the weak underlying financials of many players in the industry, the long-term outlook is positive because PV prices are reaching grid parity in more of the world.","Our strategy is to continue to build our position as the premier PV material supplier by stressing the importance of selecting high-value high efficiency materials to extend the life of PV systems which will assist the industry in its drive towards grid parity.","For our Industrial Biosciences segment on Slide 10 this year, our sales and operating earnings have grown each quarter and third quarter operating earnings of $45 million were up 13%.","On Slide 11, from Nutrition & Health, we continue to see strong demand for cultures and probiotics and we delivered good results in protein solutions.","Moving ahead to Performance Chemicals on Slide 12, the 25% year-over-year TiO2 volume growth in the third quarter was another positive step in the recovery. We have now recorded three consecutive quarters of year-over-year and sequential volume growth. Additionally, all regions delivered double-digit volume improvements. Europe and Asia were particularly strong.","While fourth quarter segment earnings are still expected to be modestly lower, this represents a significant improvement compared to the 51% decline we experienced to the first three quarters. We see industry fundamentals improving and our strong manufacturing technology advantages remaining intact.","For Performance Materials on Slide 13, third quarter results benefited from higher volumes in automotive, electronics and packaging markets. Year-to-date we have delivered three consecutive quarters of earnings growth accompanied by increases in operating margins.","Finally, in Safety & Protection on Slide 14, we are seeing volume improvements in U.S. ballistics military protection, certain industrial segments, garments and construction. Our targeted efforts to drive demand generation coupled with ongoing productivity measures are delivering results and improving our financial performance. Third quarter earnings were up 16% versus last year and we now have delivered three consecutive quarters of operating margin growth in this segment.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you, Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","","Great. Thank you, Carl. Now I\u2019d like to provide some insights on our earnings expectations and I\u2019ll conclude with an update regarding the strategic evaluation of Performance Chemicals.","As Nick highlighted, we do anticipate our full year earnings will be about $3.85 per share. To put that in perspective we expect to have a full year headwind from the combined impact of lower Performance Chemicals earnings and negative currency of more than $0.80 per share. Excluding these factors, our full year earnings per share increase will be 24% higher than last year in a slow growth global economy. While we maintain a cautionary macroeconomic stance it\u2019s noteworthy to highlight that we do expect fourth quarter earnings should more than double from last year\u2019s weak results.","For 2014 planning we are now beginning our business by business goal studying and execution review work. Across the portfolio we initiate this process with a macro assumption that global economies will continue to gradually improve from this year\u2019s sluggish industrial production base. To meet our future commitments we will drive performance across the company by remaining focused on our three strategic operating priorities. They are: increasing return on research and development, capitalizing on our global reach and driving execution while delivering on our productivity commitment.","First, we will deploy our science to meet today\u2019s customers\u2019 needs, build a strong and balanced pipeline of new products and increase the return on our research and development investment.","Second, we will build on our strong third quarter performance in emerging markets and capitalize on our global reach. And third, we will execute against our commitments to drive productivity and deliver cost savings that will help offset inflation and fund growth initiatives.","On the innovation front we successfully delivered 470 new products to meet customer needs in the third quarter alone. Examples of our innovation, this quarter included new applications of Kevlar aramid fibers for high strength, durable, conveyor belts for safety and protection. New branded probiotics designed for pediatric nutrition from our Nutrition & Health segment and new product blends of extra enzymes from Industrial Biosciences designed to reduce cost and improve nutrition in animal feed applications.","Now turning to Performance Chemicals, I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on our evaluation of strategic alternatives. Since our July announcement we\u2019ve made significant progress in our effort to evaluate a wide range of options. Our primary objective is to identify the alternative that creates the most value for our shareholders.","Comprehensive evaluations have progressed well and we\u2019re carefully reviewing key considerations including future CapEx growth, dividend, debt levels, pensions and taxes along with a host of other key variables that we know are important to our shareholders. We are moving with a sense of urgency.","In the interim, we remain focused on delivering results today. Our strategy is clear and it\u2019s working. We have created and are strengthening world leading positions in agriculture and nutrition, biobased industrial and advanced materials. We\u2019ve made good progress with the first three quarters despite challenging conditions that are executing successfully against our strategy.","So with that, Carl back to you.","Carl J. Lukach","Thanks, Ellen. Okay. Let\u2019s open up the line now for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning everyone. Ellen, I asked this last quarter, maybe it was a little premature. But do you have any sense of the seed cost tailwind you\u2019ll have in corn next year or now, maybe with some of the harvest just come in and you might have a better sense of what your cost build is going to be for next year in corn?","Ellen J. Kullman","So seed cost for next year, we\u2019re still gathering all the data and like that. Maybe we are getting little better yields than we have thought than we had last year. So we\u2019re looking, I don\u2019t know, maybe 1% type of things with commodity prices down.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, any sort of sense of how the pricing environment in South America is going on both the corn and soya side, are you seeing any unusual behavior from any of your competitors who are just in the market in general?","Ellen J. Kullman","No, we are not really seeing any unusual competitive behavior. I mean, we\u2019re seeing that the economics are causing growers to really think about what they are doing. The shift from corn to soybeans in the summer than looking at the prices on the corn is down there and what they are going to do for the safrinha planting. So we keep a little bit of close start to that, but I don't see anything from a competitive standpoint.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.","","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Can you hear me?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, John. How are you?","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Good, thank you. Yourself?","Ellen J. Kullman","Good.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","I am interested in the European volume number because I believe TiO2 is smaller for you in Europe and Electronics is smaller, and Ag is seasonally smaller in the third quarter. So that probably negative best industrial read that you\u2019ve got in terms of your volume statistics you gave and Europe was up 10% I think year-over-year and it was only up 5% last quarter. So could you comment on that acceleration?","Ellen J. Kullman","","Yes, sure. So again, I\u2019ll separate it first. So if we were up 10% \u2013 16% we were up in volume and developing. Europe, Middle East and Africa developed Europe with seven. Developed Europe we benefited from improvements in TiO2, in Performance Materials, and Industrial Biosciences and Ag. So we had \u2013 those four businesses, those four areas saw improvement in developed Europe. Same thing on developing Europe, more emphasis I think on Ag and TiO2.","So this is something we're watching very closely. We see it progressing, in a way it\u2019s been surfing along the bottom for so long. But I think it is a real testament to our new products and product progression that we\u2019ve made in agriculture and the investments we\u2019ve made in developing Europe and I think we\u2019re seeing the results of that investment.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And then just a follow-up for Nick. Nick, the tax rate for the year-to-date number is 23%, your guidance is 22% for the full year, why didn't you true up to 22% in the year-to-date numbers?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","We did John true up to 22%. That\u2019s what you saw in the $0.04 number there, the benefit. And what we will now see is the fourth quarter impact of that same 22% versus last year's tax rate. This is very dependent on as you know current geographic mix and how the quarter actually plays out. But year-to-date the last year was 23% and we were actually \u2013 last year it was 24% and year-to-date this year is 23.1%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Neal P. Sangani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. A question on the U.S. seed and the growth of the direct farmer approach. Is that something that is going to lead to lower costs?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, we\u2019ve had direct to farmer forever and we have invested in it over the last few years, I think that\u2019s been that in the product progression has really enabled us to gain the share that we\u2019ve gained in North America in those corn and soy. ","We believe in that Right Product Right Acre strategy making sure that we're working directly with the farmer. What hybrid, what seed size, get on their first choice, get it in the barn. And I think that\u2019s made us success, and well that what place it makes it more stickier with the farmer and really creates efficiencies in our supply chain. So it allows us to plan a lot better since we have that detailed knowledge and the mapping on those acres.","Neal P. Sangani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Okay, and Syngenta talked about producing too much seed this year, as far as some write-downs. Is that an industry issue or you all see something similar?","Ellen J. Kullman","","No, write-downs are a normal part of the seed business, they happen every year. We\u2019ve seen our seeds yield, this year it\u2019s a little better than last year, but not hugely better. And we expect write-downs in the normal historic range. We don\u2019t see anything unusual there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi. Good morning.","Ellen J. Kullman","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi. I was wondering Ellen, if you could review the reasons for why you\u2019re exploring strategic options for titanium dioxide for Performance Chemicals, why it might create value to separate the business off? And if you could also review the arguments against it, that is why you might keep it, what lead to the current structural change?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, certainly if you think about the focus that we\u2019ve had since the beginning of 2009, right and when this leadership team came in, the global financial crisis, and I\u2019ve talked about this often as every boat on its own bottom. The businesses, why we change the segment reporting to get great clarity on how our Ag business is doing, how our paint business is doing, how our chemical business is doing. ","We established distinct goals from a growth and a margin expansion for each one of those and are on that track. We\u2019ve been as we came out of those financial crisis really took a look at how science makes the difference in creating a differentiated transition in the market play. And clearly as you saw with the disposition of our paint business we really felt that there was a limited opportunity for science to make a difference there and we took the actions that we did.","If you look at Performance Chemicals, it\u2019s a strong set of business with good margin. We\u2019ve seen in the last year the volatility of that set of business is $0.65 a share down this year to date I think it\u2019s the correct Nick can correct me if I\u2019ve got a little wrong.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","It\u2019s right.","Ellen J. Kullman","","And it\u2019s been a headwind this year. So you\u2019ve a commodity set of businesses, you\u2019ve got volatility and low growth. That was about a GDP kind of growth business. So the question, what will does that have in our portfolio and that\u2019s what the Board and management is discussing. And so, from the positive side it can create cash. On the negative side, it creates great volatility. And so at the end of the day, I think that we have to understand what is that that\u2019s for our shareholders, how do we create the most value there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","","Thank you. One question on Ag, you hit on the top line, you hit strong growth this year and you get 12% on a year-to-date basis. If you can just give us a sense of what price, what volume, what currency hit you\u2019ve taken? And more importantly, what\u2019s the sustainability of these gains in to next year, what are your expectations for example on pioneer pricing in the U.S. market?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yeah, thanks Don and we\u2019re making great progress in agriculture this year. Currency has been about a 2% DuPont headwind of that 12%. And so volume and price, we\u2019ve hit a little more price than volume given the new product and that product mix has really been driving our price gains. And so price is a little heavier than volume, but we\u2019ve had strong volume progression. We grew volume in North America in corn. ","We\u2019ll have all those. We\u2019re pulling together all those numbers. If the USDA had only reported in October we\u2019d be in a little better position than in talking about the total. But I think that we\u2019re really making real confidence in business and really making progress. So now we\u2019re heading into Brazil and last year we gained three points a share both in summer and the perennial season in corn. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments in there, in the plants in supply chain improvements down there and I think we\u2019re going to see great progression there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yes, Ellen just a follow-up on your strategic review of Performance Chemicals, I think you\u2019ve mentioned in your prepared remark, you\u2019re moving with a sense of urgency. Would you care to offer any update on timing of the decision and whether or not you\u2019ve narrowed down the options in terms of whether the businesses might be separated together with each other or apart from each other and the form of possible separation if you decide to go down that path?","Ellen J. Kullman","","Yes, so we\u2019re looking at lot of different options. We are operating with a sense of urgency and we want to get this done as quickly as we can.","Kevin W. McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, follow-up, this may on Ag, you mentioned on Slide 8, that you anticipate an early start to North America seed shipments, it surprised me a little bit I guess growers seem to be getting orders in quite early the last two years, do you expect it to run even earlier this year and if so, how much might be pulled from 1Q in your estimation?","Ellen J. Kullman","I think that\u2019s a little hard to estimate right now. We do see an interest in making sure the farmers get the right hybrid, the right seed size, get their first choice, get it in their barn. And so we\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity there this year than maybe we saw last year and again I think that with the moderating commodity prices people are very interested in understanding that they are going to get the deal that they need to make the economics work for them.","We\u2019re also seeing a lot of interest in AQUAmax. We\u2019ve really increased the acreage there. This year we\u2019re excited to see I guess in three weeks, Paul Schickler will be out talking about how the season has shaped us for us. We talked a lot of that last week and I was very, very excited to see the performance that our growers are staying in the field. So I think there will be good news in a few weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Thank you, Ellen very good results in Performance Materials, first in the top line you mentioned the China what\u2019s driving that very strong growth in China volumes for Performance Materials?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, volumes are up by 18% in China and what we\u2019re seeing that is an automotive, I mean automotive is very strong, if the whole world in automotive is only growing 2% this year, China will be up 10%. And we are making great progress with our penetration, our application development, and light weighting vehicles and the advanced plastics and even in S&P we are seeing some uplift on Kevlar actually in the automotive application. And so it\u2019s really China is the story of auto, electronics and the industrial and we\u2019re seeing progression there versus what this time last year was a very weak quarter.","David I. Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And also in the performance very good market as well 22.5%, where do you think margins can go or should that be sustained here at these levels in Performance Materials going forward?","Ellen J. Kullman","So Performance Materials, we\u2019re seeing lot of strength based of our packaging materials and the penetrations that we\u2019ve made. We have long-term estimates that are lower than the 23% right now. If you look at it across the entire ray, but high-teens kind of thing but this is something that we are challenging the team to do. We are challenging the team to really understand the new products and the penetration there and what can be achieved to help differentiate that we are in this market. So I\u2019m very excited about what this team is doing in Performance Materials.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Yes, thank you and good morning. I think in your press release you mentioned about your TiO2 ore contract, what\u2019s the timing of the TiO2 resource and do you have any significant contract that\u2019s sliding in 2013?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Hi, Nick here, so P.J. when you look at our supply position around over ore there, we have staggered contracts so not everything expires at one time, but as those contracts have expired as of recent when we\u2019ve gone out into the marketplace. ","We have seen a higher cost in our ore costs as a reason, but we are still very advantage from an ore perspective versus the competitive set, given our ability to consume the low-grade ores and produce the high quality TiO2. So we\u2019ll continue to have that accrue over time, so there will be contracts ending as we renew others, but in a macro sense we remain very advantage there.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. And my second question is a follow-up on seed pricing, what kind of seed pricing do you actually achieve in Latin America this year, and what\u2019s the expectation for good U.S. seeds? Thank you.","Ellen J. Kullman","So from a standpoint of seed pricing in Latin America, it\u2019s being driven by Intrasect. It is really a mix, so as we get more and more penetration and find the Intrasect product into corn in Latin America, you're seeing a positive impact on price. And we're seeing at this point, you told about yield and what a farmer can get Intrasect, I expect this year is going to be probably a third of our volume and continue to make progress. In the U.S. it is a little hard to say right now, I mean I think mix is again going to be a driver and it is going to from a product standpoint and where farmers think they can get the best deal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Good morning. In fact a couple of questions on Ag, in fact first one is how the last two seasons in Latin America, can you elaborate a bit more on what\u2019s driving interest in the Latin American crop chemistry piece. Overall acreage growth is up, but it doesn't seem like it\u2019s quite enough to substantiate sort of the outlook of the new products or is there something more specific.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, a smart thing what you're seeing is the benefits of Rynaxypyr is creating around that really heavy insect pressure down in Latin America. It is phenomenally effective. It is very efficient and it\u2019s very low toxin, very human friendly. Our team there we kind of always question them very deeply about their revenue progression because now we are saying that globally Rynaxypyr is going to be above $900 million in revenue in 2013 and it didn\u2019t even exist five years ago. And I think that\u2019s one of the really strong proof points around the power of combining chemistry and biology, really understanding the biology of the bug and how the chemistry can create that real advantage. And farmers are anticipating heavy pest pressure in Latin America this year and they are taking action on it. And we are seeing that in the volume numbers in our agriculture segment.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","And then as a follow-up, Ellen, what do you see is the best way to value the Ag business or what is the best way to incorporate the value of the Ag business more appropriately in DuPont to stock price?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, I think that what you\u2019ve seen in the last few years is tremendous performance in our Ag business, against our competition. We\u2019re winning in the marketplace since 2008, 10 points a share gain in beans in North America, six points in corn. Margin expansion, I think you\u2019ve seen if you look at our stock price over that time, I think you will see our total TSR is I don't know 180% \u2013 182% versus the S&P for I don\u2019t know about 107%. ","So I think we\u2019ve seen, since we\u2019ve created a very strong position in Ag coming off of 2008 till now. I think we have seen \u2013 are competing in the marketplace, are winning in the marketplace. And I think that you\u2019ve seen that reflected in the TSR that our shareholders have experienced since then.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John P. McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. With regard to the strategic review in Performance Chems, it looks like you and the Board have really been kind of trying to figure out, does it really fit in into the benefit of the Company. In this process, have you and\/or the Board thought about other assets within the portfolio to see if they also make sense in the overall platform to DuPont?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so, we as you know instituted in the last 4.5 years very strong portfolio analysis process with our Board, with management and with the Board. We look at it every quarter from a management standpoint. We take the Board through it on a consistent basis, understanding how value is derived from each one of our major product areas. You see some minor adjustments like in crop protection, well sell mancozeb or something like that you will see majors like the disposition of our Performance Coatings and it\u2019s a very active process.","We consider the competitive environment. We consider how science can really make a difference from a competitive standpoint and win in the marketplace because that\u2019s the key. And I think we take that very actively as you see from the discussions what we announced in July that we are looking at strategic alternatives for the Performance Chemicals area and we will conclude that.","John P. McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great. And then just as a follow-up, when you look at this major kind of geographic regions, it sounds like Europe is maybe doing a little bit better, China I think in the opening remarks, it was indicated, that\u2019s starting to maybe reaccelerate and yet you pulled down your kind of global industrial production forecast or I guess where are you seeing the incremental weakness relative to some of those areas that you highlighted.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think well, the economists are projecting, they were projecting pretty aggressive industrial production for 2013 and it turned out to be lower than that. So I guess in the beginning of the year they got enough, you can remember it was in the high 2s.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes, almost 3%.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, almost 3%.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Now it\u2019s just below 2%.","Ellen J. Kullman","Just below 2%. So I think that\u2019s a reflection of the global economy. We are seeing great pass, when you think about automotive, it\u2019s only up 2%, but it\u2019s up 10% in China, it\u2019s going to be 5%, 6% in North America.","So we\u2019re seeing even though there is lower growth in automotive, we\u2019re seeing some real bright spots in a couple other regions. I think we are seeing PV recovery coming. We\u2019ve seen a little bit this quarter. We\u2019ve seen the TiO2 market stabilize really and it has gone sideways a little bit right now.","But, so I think when you put that a look, industrial production is little less than what we saw at the beginning of the year, but obviously with our new products that we have introduced and our focus on the marketplace, we are going to figure out regardless of the environment, focus on how we can win.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Two questions; first, on the Nutrition & Health business, can you elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s driving the weak volume performance and when you think you will be back to a more sustainable growth trajectory? And then on Agriculture, could you give an update on the 360 program and I think more broadly, are you seeing any evidence that data intensity or is actually driving pricing power and wallet share gains in the Ag sector or is it just one more way to maintain tuft for the customer?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so I think what you have to consider on the Nutrition & Health is that, we shutdown some assets last year in one of the product lines that were not productive, and so part of the negative volume is the fact that we actually don\u2019t sell in those low-end commodity areas anymore. So our volume is down. And as we continue to drive towards the more differentiated areas like cultures and probiotics, we\u2019re really making great progress, actually with the startup of the plant in China. So I think there are good transition that\u2019s going on there and that you are going to see as we come through this and a real focus on taking these assets and making it much higher quality from that standpoint.","From the 360, the whole purpose is to drive yield improvement and today it is subscription based. We\u2019re working with the customer with the tools in order to be able to map and to be able to understand how big you can get more from using data as \u2013 big data, you\u2019re fine, right. We\u2019ve got, I think 1.5 million acres under variable rate seeking prescription this past spring and we continue to see how the data and the tools can even further enhance our historic strength in white product, great market. And so we see it as a natural progression, our go-to-market strategy, because at the end of the day it\u2019s all about the farmer and that\u2019s what we\u2019re good at.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Thanks, Ellen. Given the 40% volume growth in Electronics & Communications and the share gains that came with it, I wonder if you can give us a sense of what products are driving that. If I remember correctly your PV installation expectations are lower now than they were at the beginning of the year. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what the overall balance is. You picked up share of what looks like a smaller overall market.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so the improvement year-over-year in electronics in the third quarter is driven off of PV, which is Tedlar sales and Solamet metallized paste. We\u2019re also seeing some cap fund, kind of improvement as you see new smartphones and things like that come out. But just take Solamet paste, the sales were up 42% year-over-year and Tedlar was up, I think over 70% year-over-year.","So I mean, you\u2019re coming off of a real low point in the third quarter last year and we\u2019ve been on a campaign. I think our team has done a great job in that industry focused on materials matter. That materials are huge part of creating not only the efficiency to sell the module, but the lifetime of the module And so I think if you\u2019re seeing the share gain based on that. Dave always said this is a lumpy market. So with him I\u2019m going to hold my breath, but I think you see the focus and the progress that\u2019s being made there.","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Okay. And just a follow-up, I\u2019m trying to understand the cash flow of the Imprelis payments. If you are right about the overall $1.2 billion, if I remember correctly the insurance is about $700 million, but has that already paid out or does that pay out later? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the cash flow impact might be.","Ellen J. Kullman","Nick, why don\u2019t you take that one?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Yes. So when you look at the cash flow thus far in the way of payments from the insurance companies, we\u2019ve had our first insurance payment of $25 million. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen to date and that\u2019s something that will now progress as time goes forward. You know what the accrual is to date and you can see what we put in the press release as the ceiling.","Operator","","Thank you. We now have Chris Nocella online from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Chris J. Nocella \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Nick, just sticking with cash, both your share count and cash balance moved higher in the quarter. So can you remind us how much you have left in your share repurchase program and why you aren\u2019t little more aggressive on this front?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Well, we continue to be very active in the share buyback arena. We bought over $1 billion this year and if you look back over time, over the last, well I\u2019d say since fourth quarter 2010 time period, we\u2019ve brought back over $2.3 billion worth of shares. So it\u2019s not something that we don\u2019t exercise and utilize. We have and we will continue to do so. We have a program, an active program where we still have $1.7 billion left available to us for share buyback. We\u2019ll continue to execute against that. As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s not a one-for-one sort of thing, but we will continue to utilize that program and continue to make sure we maintain a valid share count there.","Operator","Thank you. We have Duffy Fischer online from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Yes. Good morning. Continue to be presently surprised with the Cyazypyr and how that\u2019s growing. You are now calling for that to get to a 1.5 billion from 900 million, which is probably about 20% growth rate. Which derivatives of Rynaxypyr are going to drive that next 600 million? And then what would the incremental margins on that growth look like relative to what it\u2019s delivering today?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think that \u2013 so Cyazypyr is just now being registered around the world. So we\u2019re going to see next year uptake in Cyazypyr. I also think the seed treatment Dermacor and Lumigen are going to have tremendous additions to those and I think the margins are going to hold. I think we\u2019re seeing equal value from the newer chemistry Cyazypyr and the seed treatment area as well. So we see it as really just a tremendous progress being made by that business.","Operator","Thank you. We have Mark Gulley online from BGC Financial. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial LP","Good morning. You talked about some headwinds for this year in terms of certain items.

Fanandakis","","We haven\u2019t sized that yet, Mark for next year on the tax rate and expectations on that. Right now we\u2019re saying as we\u2019ve stated that this year is going to be the 22% and a lot will depend on the mix and the forecast we have from the businesses as we go through our reviews around execution and objective setting for next year within the businesses.","Mark R. Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial LP","","And secondly, you did provide some volume information with respect to the TiO2 business. I\u2019m wondering if you can approximate the size of the price movement year-to-year and what it might look during the fourth quarter?","Ellen J.

Hey, Nick you mentioned that the unfunded balance is going to be down about $2 billion to $3 billion in the fourth quarter. Assuming that the current rate assumptions fall together, your pension was like $0.46 negative in 2012, $0.40 this year, what should we be thinking about ballpark for 2014?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Yes, Frank it\u2019s too soon to talk about that piece of it, because what you\u2019re talking about is the accounting side of it there and lot of things still have to play out by year-end. I will say my guess is, it\u2019s going to be lower again, but I just don\u2019t have it sized yet at this point, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, so we\u2019re\u2026","","Ellen J. Kullman","Yeah, we\u2019ll open that out, what he have\u2026","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Yes, as we get closer to year-end, Frank, I will be able to give you a better view on that.","Frank J. Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","All right, great. And Ellen obviously your balance sheet is not stressed, what should we be thinking about in terms of the M&A pipeline that DuPont has and can we see some action taking place there in the near-term?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think, Frank, we\u2019ve been real consistent on how we talked about the M&A pipeline. We are looking for things either from a science or technology standpoint that really can advance the positions that where we are. And or geographic cover it\u2019s like you\u2019re seeing in Pannar, I\u2019 mean Pannar brought not only geographic covers but a broader local genetics that we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of to continue to penetrate Sub Saharan Africa. We continue to look in areas in advanced materials, in structural biosciences and Ag\u2019s but as you know we have a pretty hard bar on what our expectations are from an M&A standpoint. So it\u2019s a very competitive market out there and we continue to look to see how we can grow, enhance our growth and our returns through M&A and so we\u2019ll keep you posted.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

(Operator Instructions) After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period. (Operator Instructions)  Thank you.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you may begin.","Karen A. Fletcher","Thanks, John. Good morning and welcome everyone. With me today are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and our incoming VP of Investor Relations, Carl Lukach. The slides for today's call can be found on our website, along with the news release that was issued earlier today.","During the course of this conference call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and as you to review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release is available on our website. Please note that all comments about fourth quarter full year 2012 and any historical references to earnings performance will be made on a continuing operations basis and excludes significant items.

We posted supplemental information on our website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company\u2019s performance.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen Kullman","Great, thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.11 per share finished above our previous guidance due to the strong close of our agricultural businesses in Latin America and a solid quarter for Performance Materials.","As we discussed the declines versus last year's results primarily was due to weak demand and lower prices in Performance Chemicals market. Aside from strengthen, Ag, Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences, other segments saw customers and industrial markets cautious than the quarter tightly managing inventories in the face of global, economic uncertainties. Our teams executed well under the circumstances and Karen will provide detail by segment.","I\u2019d like to share my perspectives on the full-year 2012 and following Nick and Karen's review, I'll be back to discuss our outlook for the coming year.","3% revenue growth for 2012 and $3.33 earnings per share from continuing operations were below plan and very disappointing to me. I expected cost to deliver solid results each and every year. In 2012, we saved $0.27 of currency headwinds and $0.19 for the forecasted drop-off in pharmaceutical royalties. We captured more than $130 million of acquisition synergies from Danisco and far exceeded our $300 million cost productivity and $300 million working capital productivity goals. We had double digit earnings growth in agriculture and performance materials, but all these accomplishments were not enough to overcome the sharper than expected declines in demand for two of our product groups, specifically titanium dioxide and photovoltaic materials. ","We are a leading global supplier to both markets, so the single year impact in 2012 was severe. As disruptive as this was in 2012, our market sensing work is detecting signs of stabilizing in both markets. As we begin 2013, I am confident we have the right strategies and actions in place to deliver better performance. Our company is stronger today than it was just a year ago from several perspectives. We have stronger positions in key growth markets such as agriculture, food, automotive, and energy. Our innovation engine continued to deliver strong, steady flow of new and improved products with greater value to customers. ","In 2012, we had a record number of new product introductions. In North America, we introduced 154 new corn hybrid and 33 new soybean varieties. These products target at local market needs bringing strong ergonomic performance and excellent yields often times under adverse weather conditions. ","Industrial Biosciences introduced a next-generation phytase enzyme to the U.S. Animal Nutrition Industry designed to operate enhanced performance and significant feed cost savings for animal producers with reduced environmental pollution from livestock. In our Protection Technologies business, a new light denier Kevlar AP, which was developed using our latest technology in our Cooper River plant, has been introduced in automotive tires in Europe. On the Performance Materials area, our Zytel PLUS engineering polymer was selected by a major auto OEM in India as a lighter, stronger material for charge air coolers to be used on several turbo diesel powered vehicles.","Differentiated products and applications developed by our scientists around the world delivered business value for our customers and sustainable growth for DuPont. And our scientists are connecting directly with customers in our newly opened innovation centers. We now have nine centers in operation around the world, and I\u2019m very pleased to see the ramp up in customer collaboration. These drive sales with new products and applications delivering value through innovations that can lead to growth and share gain for DuPont and for our customers.","We continue to have a laser focus on efficiency and productivity across every business and function. This includes the restructuring program we launched last quarter, which positions our businesses to be more agile and profitable long-term.","Financially, we are stronger than a year ago, which Nick will describe, get us lower cash balances or higher and working capital productivity, it\u2019s improved. In a few weeks, we expect to close on the successful sale of our Performance Coatings business that will be a value creating for all parties. And we are far down in the past with successfully integrating the Danisco acquisition achieving cost and revenue synergies in excess of our initial target.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Nick and then come back at the end to discuss how we\u2019ll be addressing the challenges and opportunities that I see for 2013. Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on slide 3. Underlying earnings from continuing operations of $0.11 per share were down $0.15 versus the prior year. This decline primarily reflects the cyclical downturn in TiO2, as well as $0.06 of lower pharmaceutical income. Consolidated net sales of $7.3 billion were flat versus the prior year. ","Volume increased 3% led by agriculture, which grew 11% in the quarter. From a geographic perspective, volume growth was highest in Latin America at 8%, where Ag business flourished followed by Asia Pacific at 6%. Additionally, sales in developing markets increased 8% during the quarter. ","For more information regarding the Company's sales by geographic region, please look at slide 4. Higher volume was offset by 2% unfavorable currency impact. Local selling prices were flat versus as value driven Ag pricing was offset by decline in TiO2 prices. ","Let\u2019s turn to the corporate view of the fourth quarter looking at earnings per share variance analysis on slide 5, which is shown on a continuing operations basis. The first item I\u2019d like to highlight is variable cost, which was $0.12 tailwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were down about 4% versus the prior year. Volume, which was up 3% in the quarter, is shown as a $0.03 decline in earnings waterfall due to the impact of lower plant utilization in certain businesses. ","Next, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. This change includes the $0.07 of growth investments in R&D and selling expense for the Ag segment, $0.02 higher non-cash pension in OPEB costs as well as additional growth investments outside of Ag.","Along with taking actions to support growth, we delivered about $4 million of fixed cost productivity in 2012. And I\u2019m pleased to point out that this far exceeds our commitment of $300 million. Moreover, for the time period 2010 to 2012, we delivered greater than $1.2 billion well above our $1 billion target.","Moving on to income taxes; as expected, on a year-over-year basis income tax was a tailwind in the fourth quarter as shown in this chart. However, our full 2012 year based tax rate of 22.8% was higher than our previous guidance of about 22%. The impact of this difference was recognized in the fourth quarter and was about a $0.04 headwind versus our guidance.","Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.06 hurt, a full year 2012 royalties of only $62 million. This is the last quarter that will see a significant reduction moving forward. For 2013, we anticipate in pharma royalties to be above $20 million.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 6, we ended the year with $3.1 billion of free cash flow on a total company basis versus $3.3 billion last year. The decline primarily reflects the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan made in January of 2012, and lower net income partially offset by working capital productivity. As a reminder, there was no contribution to the U.S. pension plan in 2011. For 2012, we delivered about $400 million of working capital productivity, again exceeding our commitment to the $300 million.","For the time period 2010 to 2012, we delivered greater than $1.6 billion, far exceeding our $1 billion target. We ended 2012 with net debt of $7.3 billion, which was $1.2 billion less than our position in December 2011. This decrease reflects our exceptional free cash flow performance for the year.","In 2012, we paid $1.6 billion in dividends and yesterday, our Board approved our 434th consecutive quarterly dividend. Additionally, as we announced in December, we will use a portion of the proceeds from the Performance Coatings divestiture to complete a $1 billion share repurchase program in 2013, which further reflects our commitment to creating value for our shareholders.","In summary the fourth quarter played out mostly as we expected, as we anticipated, the cyclical decline in TiO2 price and lower pharmaceutical income had a negative impact on the quarter\u2019s earnings.","Turning now to slide 7 on 2013, we expect sales of about $36 billion. Our guidance for operating earnings is $3.85 to $ 4.05 per share, an increase of 2% to 7% from 2012 on a comparable basis. This guidance takes into consideration the $1 billion share buyback program.","We expect solid earnings growth in all of our segments except for Performance Chemicals. Last month, on our Investor Call, we shared expectations that our Performance Chemicals margin would decline 6 percentage points to 7 percentage points in 2013 versus near peak margins in 2012.","Based on our current view of the TiO2 industry, the margin decline maybe 7 percentage points to 9 percentage points, and that more conservative view is now reflected in our guidance.","If we were to exclude Performance Chemicals from the equation, we would expect robust earnings growth of at least high teens in 2013. Because of the cyclical decline in titanium dioxide prices is a significant headwind as we move into 2013, we expect earnings in the first two quarters to decline modestly on a year-over-year basis. If you recall, we had very strong comps for Performance Chemicals in these two quarters.","On slide 8, we list our financial assumptions for 2013. Broadly speaking, we expect global growth of about 2% against the backdrop of a world economy that continues to face many uncertainties. We expect global industrial production to increase about 2% in 2013 led by China. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, delivering on productivity is a mandate for us and our ongoing cost productivity target for 2013 is at least $300 million; this is an addition to the $300 million of savings we expect to realize in 2013 from our restructuring activities that we announced last quarter. We expect about a 5% increase in raw material, energy and transportation costs in 2013, primarily due to higher seed input costs.","In summary, our market environment is a dynamic one. We\u2019re facing a significant headwind relating to the cyclical nature of our TiO2 business, which we will manage through. Our businesses are executing well as they face a wide array of market conditions.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Karen to review the segments. Karen.","Karen A. Fletcher","Thanks, Nick. Starting with agriculture on slide 9, first quarter, fourth quarter is our smallest quarter in Ag and reflects the tail end of the Latin America's summer season, the beginning of Brazil\u2019s [premier] season and a small portion of the 2013 northern hemisphere season.","Fourth quarter sales of $1.5 billion were up 18%, with volume gains of 11%, and price gains of 7%. The seasonal TiO2 loss of $92 million improved versus prior year loss on higher sales, despite increased investments and currency headwinds. Earnings were better than expected due to stronger sales in Latin America and lower seed cost in Latin America and North America.","A strong close to the year pushed us over the $10 billion mark in annual sales. This full year margins expanding by nearly a 100 basis points to 20% more than overcoming headwinds from higher seed costs and continued strategic investments in commercial and R&D activities.","Taking a closer look within the segment, seed fourth quarter sale of $771 million increased 24%, despite currency headwinds, led by growth in Latin America. Our business in Brazil won big again with another year of multiple point share gain in summer corn, mixed improvement and significant  price growth.","Our sales teams are off to another strong start in North America and in the Safrinha corn season in Brazil. In North America, orders and prepayments for corn and soybeans are ahead of last year, and meeting our growth plan. The strength of our order book is driven by the strong performance we demonstrated under last season\u2019s difficult growing conditions, and grow intentions to plant a similar number of corn and soybean acres as last year.","In crop protection, sales for the quarter of $764 million outpaced the market with 13% growth, offsetting currency led by insecticides and herbicides in Latin America and corn and soybean herbicides in North America. Sales growth was driven by volume increases in all regions and pricing gains in each segment. We expect another year of solid growth in 2013 in crop protection. We had limited, but highly successful country launch of our Rynaxypyr insect control products in fourth quarter of 2012 and look forward to broad registrations in new markets and crops in 2013.","Our launch of the (inaudible) fungicide in the United States for the 2013 planting season and continued expansion of (inaudible) will extend our growing fungicide portfolio. In addition, strong pre-season demand for our diversified corn and soybean herbicide product line continues to be driven by excellent performance results from new product introduction and a continued success of our go-to-market approach together with Pioneer.","The continuing renewal of our portfolio to focus on strategic markets and strong execution of our teams with new product launches all leave us well position to take advantage of the opportunity in Ag markets around the world.","Looking ahead to the first half of 2013 for the Agriculture segment, we expect significant sales increases from volume and price driving a moderate earnings increase. For the full-year, we expect sales growth in the low teens and margins will be pressured slightly as higher commodity prices and weather are increasing seed costs as compared to last year. The continuing momentum of our Ag business, strong order book and customer prepayment, and ongoing strategic investment in research production capacity to market all give us confidence that we are on track to meet our aggressive goals.","Moving to slide 10 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $622 million was down 1% with 2% higher volumes offset by 3% lower prices primarily due to lower silver cost half through. PTOI declined $80 million from the prior year, which benefited from the licensing income payment of $20 million in the development of advanced OLED.","For the first quarter, we entered the peak sales will be down modestly versus prior year and PTOI will be down significantly due to softness in consumer electronics and photovoltaics material sales.","On a full-year basis, we anticipate PV demand to gradually improve and forecast module installation rates to be essentially flat versus 2012. Full year PV installations are expected to be up in the U.S., Japan, and China offset by declines in Europe. The PV market has shown signs of stabilizing. However, it remains volatile due largely to industry overcapacity with uneven growth rates anticipated over the short-term.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 11, an Industrial Biosciences. Sales of $300 million were primarily up on higher demand for Sorona polymer for carpeting, as well as the continued growth in food enzymes in Europe. PTOI was up 29% on higher sales and the realization of synergies related to the integration of the Danisco enzyme business. Margins improved 300 basis points for the quarter and for the full year.","Looking forward to 2013, we see strong demand for Sorona as residential housing improved and Sorona used growth in commercial applications. Bolstered by new technology launches, we anticipate solid demands on most enzyme segment, offsetting declines in enzyme demand related to ethanol production until producer margins improve there.","For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly and earnings to increase substantially benefiting from the realization of integration synergies, improved profitability of biomaterials, and new product lines.","Turning now to slide 12 in our Nutrition & Health segment, sales of $853 million were up 6% split evenly between volume and price. Volume growth reflects strong demand for probiotics, cultures and enablers. Higher local prices in all regions were partially offset by unfavorable currency.","PTOI was up 27% on higher sales and the realization of synergies related to the integration of Danisco specialty food ingredients business and partially offset by higher raw material cost. For the full year, margin increased about 300 basis points. ","For the first quarter, we expect moderate sales growth from our products group. Earnings will be essentially flat as higher as sales and integration synergies will be offset by higher raw material cost. We see margins improving as we progress through the year, as the impact of high cost raw material inventories [lessen].","Now let's discuss Performance Chemicals on slide 13. Sales of $1.6 billion were down 15% on lower volume and price. PTOI declined 54% on lower sales and lower plant utilization charges. Fluoropolymers volumes were down significantly on lower demands in Europe and the U.S. TiO2 prices were down significantly, while volumes were slightly down. ","In the first quarter, we anticipate sales in PTOI down substantially, primarily due to lower cyclical TiO2 prices and tough comps. On a sequential basis versus fourth quarter 2012, we expect sales in PTOI down moderately. For the full year 2013, we expect sales down moderately and PTOI margins to decline by 7 percentage points to 9 percentage points versus near peak margins in 2012.","We maintain our view that the TiO2 market will bottom in the first half as underlying demand improves and producer inventory levels decline. We took action in the fourth quarter to return our year-end finished TiO2 inventory to normal level. Improvements in U.S. housing coupled with signs of stabilization in China are expected to strengthen demand. These factors point to a gradual strengthening of industry fundamentals and severe progresses.","Turning now to Performance Materials on slide 14; sales of $1.5 billion were down 5%. Stable packaging market and continued steady demand in the North American and China automotive markets were partially offset by softness in the Industrial and Electronic sectors. PTOI increased 68% due to lower feedstock cost, higher volume, and mix enrichment, partially offset by unfavorable currency.","For the first quarter, auto sales are expected to be down 4% versus a strong comp in the first quarter 2012. Despite this headwind, we expect sales in Performance Materials to be essentially flat with PTOI up moderately. For the full year, we expect automotive-related sales growth in North America and China partially offset by slowdowns in Europe and Japan. The volume in consumer and industrial markets is expected to grow slightly and feedstock costs are anticipated to remain favorable in 2013.","On slide 15, we\u2019ll cover the Safety and Protection segment. Sales increased 2% on higher demand for Sustainable Solutions offerings and U.S. construction products. PTOI was down $6 million primarily due to lower plant utilization related to softness in certain industrial markets and U.S. public sector.","For the first quarter, we expect sales to be down modestly and PTOI to be down moderately on a year-over-year basis. However, we will see sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. We anticipate this momentum to continue through the year with significant earnings growth on a year-over-year basis in the second half. We believe that industrial markets demand will improve throughout 2013 particularly in China. Following the Lunar New Year and leadership transition, we expect infrastructure spending to increase the rest of the year.","With the continued new home construction rebound in the U.S., we saw pickup in sales of Tyvek HomeWrap in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re anticipating this increased demand to continue into 2013. As the year progresses, we expect more consistent spending in the public sector and anticipate more fulfillment of open military tenders.","Lastly, we expect the higher demand for Sustainable Solutions offerings that we saw in the fourth quarter to carry into 2013.","So this concludes the segment update, and I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ellen.","Ellen Kullman","Great, thank you, Karen. Heading into 2013, we\u2019ve made some adjustments to our business plan, shifted resources and implemented restructuring, following that enabling our business just to grow in a slower growth environment. We see market conditions stabilizing for almost challenge segments Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications with upside potential if conditions improved.","Our opportunities and challenges vary by region. The U.S. is experiencing a weak recovery with bright spot and pent-up demand for housing and autos. This provides growth opportunities for our Performance Materials, Safety & Protection, and Performance Chemicals segments.","Growth in China is showing signs of picking up with positive implications for the rest of Asia. The general consensus of our business leaders on China, as the economy is improving and this will continue through 2013. One positive signs for our Electronics segment is the Chinese government announced plan to install 10 gigawatts of PV capacity in 2013, which compares to about 6 gigawatts of installations last year. So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic as we anticipate the changing government, leadership at the Ministry and provincial level starting late in the first quarter. ","Our business in Europe appears to be stabilizing with flat GDP. We see opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe where GDP growth is expected to be 2% to 3%. Nick provided our full year guidance with moderate sales growth to about $36 billion and our operating earnings range of $3.85 to $4.05 per share. He also went through our macro and financial assumptions, so now I would like to address some of our specific market expectations. ","So let's start with agriculture, which affects our largest segment. We expect another very good year in terms of planting and farmer economics. Our order book for seeds is strong even ahead of last year which was exceptionally were above. We're seeing strong demand for our new products and expect to build on our momentum from 2012 with another strong year.","Another high impact market is TiO2. We continue to expect the industry to remain challenged with low capacity utilization in the first half of the year followed by some recovery as demand improves particularly in U.S. housing and Asia. We continue to take out cost through ongoing productivity across the businesses including titanium ore (inaudible) as one example.","Moving to automotive market, we expect car bill is up about 2% this year after a decent year in 2012 where global bills were about 6%. Europe remains soft and we expect bills to be down as much as 10% in the first quarter, but improving sequentially throughout the year. North America bills are forecasted to be up 2% for the full year, but down slightly in the first quarter versus the tough comp.","We continue to leverage our innovation centers to partner with OEMs and apply our Advanced Materials in world class application development expertise to meet their challenges and performance, rate reduction, and energy efficiency.","U.S. housing starts will be up and the debate seems to be whether they will surpass the $1 million mark was encouraging to see housing starts approaching a more normalized rate. Our Tyvek and Corian businesses will capitalize on housing recoveries through new products and improved cost position.","In addition to market specific and customer specific plants, we\u2019ll create value from our productivity and restructuring programs. We expect to reap benefits in terms of operational leverage and accelerating growth. These programs are tailored to each of our businesses and are focused on maximizing value creation for customers by differentially driving growth through innovation and productivity.","As we begin 2013, I\u2019m confident we have the right strategies and programs in place and that we will execute well against them. Last month we backed up that confidence with $1 billion share buyback authorization.","Let me close by saying, we are planning an Investor Day on May 2. I invite you to join us here on Wilmington to learn more about our long-term strategy, our segment plans, and updated long-term segment targets. You will have the opportunity to hear directly from our business presidents and our key leaders. So we hope you can join us.","So with that, Karen, back to you.","Karen A. Fletcher","Great, thanks, Ellen. John, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, and I will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Can you give us a sense of Pioneer\u2019s share fluctuations in Brazil for both the corn and soybeans markets, please?","Ellen Kullman","Hi, Kevin, thanks. And yeah, we\u2019re winning in corn in Brazil without multi-point share gain in summer corn again. We are expecting largely freeing up corn hectares maybe up 15% to 20%. And we\u2019re experiencing strong orders for the premium season.","So soy from a share standpoint is flat, and so I think our investments there paying off, where we had a very strong season as you can see from our results in the fourth quarter. And I be \u2013 here both I left out in fact with our crop protection business is having a great season in Latin America, as well led by Rynaxypyr and so overall for our Tyvek segment, we\u2019re seeing Latin America very strong.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","As a follow up, if I may, can you characterize the magnitude of inflation and seed production costs in 2013, and do you think you might be able to get enough price through to preserve margin there?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah. Well, if you see from our results in the fourth quarter, we had lowered than expected seed costs, so that\u2019s a positive. But with what happened last year, we do expect to see obviously higher seed costs coming into the North American seeds. And I mean, if you look at it from a total company standpoint, our loss we\u2019re citing from a company standpoint to be up about 5% and that\u2019s still from a seed cost standpoint and TiO2 standpoint or the two drivers of that.","Higher seed inputs year-over-year will pressure margins slightly, but we think with the improved yields and performance of our products out there, and we\u2019ve been out \u2013 fall without, I guess November or December talking about 5% to 10% net price increase in North America. We think that bodes well for a strong year.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Nocella from RBC Capital Markets.","Chris Nocella \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, yes. Just on your EPS guidance for 2013 versus the guidance given early December, you lowered the performance Chem segment, so which businesses now do you expect to be higher, or is just that you\u2019re including the share repurchases now into your guidance?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, we are including the share repurchase now in our guidance. And we gave kind of a soft range, low to mid, and I think you see coming in at 2% to 7%, it\u2019s pretty consistent with that. We had some puts to take and take, we have a stronger Ag season coming through the fourth quarter. And obviously, we\u2019ve changed the couple of segments [minorly]. But I think things occur pretty much as expected. We\u2019re just getting a lot more specific about 2013.","Chris Nocella \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And just on your medical outlook, you are seeing 2% global GDP growth, what seems conservative for next year? Is that number were to be higher, which businesses you think would see the most upside leverage in terms of volume and margin growth?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yeah, I think the macro conditions are going to drive a lot of areas in the company, but some of the key points would drive in our Chemical segment. Some of those macro conditions are going to drive some of the things around TiO2 demand and how quickly that turns. What also impact our S&P segment around the industrial side? You would see some keys there as well as. And I think Performance Materials would see an impact if you saw GDP growth more robust in the numbers that we have provided.","Operator","Next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","Thank you. Good morning. Ellen, just on TiO2, what changed since December in terms of the guidance on the margin declines now in more severe obviously?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, I'm not sure it really changed. I think it's just gotten more specific David. I mean when we were taking \u2013 and whenever you come through a turn, you've got a range about certainty and then it tend to narrow overtime. And so specifically these markets are notoriously difficult to predict, the timing and the strength of a recovery. I think we're applying it, they\u2019re going to write-down the middle as far as what we think will happen at this point in time, got six more weeks of additional data. But a lot of this is going to be driven by what happen to the macro-economy through the first half of the year. Will the U.S. continue to improve and we have a strong North American season based on the housing starts that are predicted and things like that. ","I mean we\u2019ve seen some Chinese coming forward with things like the photovoltaic infrastructure investment. We're trying to continue that type of investment infrastructure, which will help that market solidify in turn. So there is a lot of things from a macro basis that you have to expect it, and I\u2019m not sure outlook has really changed as much as it\u2019s got more specific.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Research","And just on U.S. corn seed market share given flat plantings in 2013, do you think you can gain share in 2013 U.S. corn seeds?","Ellen Kullman","I think it's a little early to predict that. We held share last year after gaining 6 points since 2008. We have good performance from our variety that we see coming into the year, especially with the first year of the extreme product being out there. We are very excited about what we are seeing in our engagement and that\u2019s coming through with a strong order book in prepayments this year and its all based on that right product, right acre strategy, which has really been quite an advantage for us in the marketplace. ","Operator","Your next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Yeah. Good morning. Just a quick question on the TiO2 side, what kind of raw material relief are you starting to see and how does that play into your forecast throughout the year since it looks like you are calling for some decent relief in the margin as we get later in the year. ","Ellen Kullman","Hi, Nick. ","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Hi, John. When you look at our TiO2 and primary ingredient being the ore there, we have a, as you know, a very strong unique position on our ore capability. We can consume the low grade and the high grade and make the high grade TiO2. And that puts us in a very advantage position from a raw material supply standpoint. With that said, we are forecasting our ore cost will increase year-over-year because of some of the contracts and how they are staged. But even with that increase, we are still going to be in an advantage position versus the competitive set that we deal with. ","John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Okay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up, it looks like with regard to the Danisco business, you\u2019ve already pretty well integrated. I think your balance sheet is looking like it\u2019s a pretty solid shape at this point. How should we be thinking about M&A potential in 2013 with that as a result?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","","Well, we are very happy with the Danisco integration and how well things have gone there. We mentioned in the earlier part of the announcement here that we are ahead of schedule by a full year and we exceeded the $130 million synergy that we were targeting to materialize. With the closure of the Coatings business in the first quarter here, we are going to be able to further strengthen our balance sheet to ensure that AA2 rating as well as, as you know, return a significant part of that value back to the shareholders. ","We're always looking for opportunities in very specific areas around Ag, nutrition and health, IB, advanced materials, but we set a pretty high bar in order to move forward in any of those sort of acquisitions, they\u2019ve got to be very strategic, they've got to be bringing something from a technical perspective or market perspective before we would move forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial.","Mark Gulley \u2013 BGC Financial","Good morning. You\u2019re justifiably proud of the productivity improvements in Danisco, but can you kind of refresh what your sales growth targets are on a go forward basis, you\u2019ve not talked about that quite as much?","Ellen Kullman","Yes. So in the Nutrition & Health segment, our sales growth targets are about 7% to 9%. We just not only finished the integration of Danisco, we are also integrating Solae. If you recall at this point last year, we bought out our minority partner and instead of operating that as a JV, we fully integrated and that\u2019s adding to our ability to really engage our customers, application development organization there is absolutely phenomenal to deliver that sales growth. ","The Industrial Biosciences side, the expectation is 10% to 12% of top line growth with the opportunities we have in enzymes and obviously with Sorona with the construction market improving. And in those areas, we expect to see margin improvement as well with the full integration from the cost side and I think that we couldn't be prouder of what those teams have done to really bring our businesses in this areas and if those businesses together create more value.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","And the other thing I would add is reinforcement, Ellen, just set around the margins. I mean if you look at this year, we\u2019ve seen 300 basis point improvement in both Nutrition & Health and IB.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan","Hi, good morning. Can you give an idea of how quickly the titanium dioxide industry grew in 2012 in volume terms, both outside of China and inside of China?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Well, it really tracks GDP sort of growth Jeff. When you look at this business, over the last 50 plus years, its tracked kind of GDP growth as an industry.","Ellen Kullman","So it lacked out a little bit in 2012.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yeah.","Ellen Kullman","As there was destocking that occurred. China was particularly low, but again we fell in the quarter and as you can see from our results, our volume in China was less 16% driven by\u2026","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","TiO2","Ellen Kullman","TiO2 and Electronics and some of those infrastructure investments that we see coming forward. So, this was a lagging year, a destocking year, a low economic environment year, and it always catches up at some point, because on average to Nick\u2019s point it\u2019s a grow at GDP. I mean, we anticipate a gradual recovery. It's not one that (inaudible). And as the year progresses and China start stabilizing, we see the continuation of what we saw on the fourth quarter, if U.S. housing comes around, these are all very positive factors for the future.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan","","Do you expect to sell more TiO2 in volume terms in the first quarter of 2013 than you did in the fourth quarter of 2012 or less or the same in rough terms?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","From a volume perspective, if you look at the fourth quarter versus the first quarter of this year, I think it\u2019s going to be roughly about the same. I think the thing what you are experiencing more in this time period Jeff is around the pricing pressures due to the inventory levels at \u2013 as an industry in the manufactures. ","Now what we have seen though is the inventories at the customer level seem to be more normalized at this point, but you still have excess inventories at the manufacturer level. So I think more of the pressure is going to be on pricing Jeff versus volume. ","Operator"," ","Next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division ","Thank you. Just two things. In Safety & Protection, PTOI was down about 6% on lower operating rates, but the segment volumes were up. Did you drawdown a lot of inventory or is there something with Cooper River there?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis  "," ","Yeah. It\u2019s really when you look at the utilization of Cooper River, when you look at that segment, there were certain areas or businesses that had strong performance, the housing, some of the sustainable solutions. But when you look at the Cooper River and the utilization of that and the fact that we are still not fully utilized that facility, the overhead that that\u2019s drawing is certainly impacting the margins in the S&P business. And what we\u2019ve said as we look forward here is Mark how we\u2019re going to improve this? And so obviously the further utilization of Cooper River is going to be beneficial, the housing increase. We are talking about housing going up 28% next year, that\u2019s going to be a benefit to the S&P. The benefits that we\u2019re getting from the restructuring, a big part of the restructuring that we just did is going to be implemented in the S&P segment, and we are going to see value arriving from that as well. So those types of things are going to be bolstering that margin as we move forward.","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And\u2026","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Sorry. Hello, ","Operator","So you might go ahead with your follow-up, Mark. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.","Mark W. Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","","Yeah, sorry. Since you brought it up, Sustainable Solutions is something we haven\u2019t talked about much at all this year, and now it\u2019s a key driver in Q4. Can you tell us what\u2019s happening there?","Ellen Kullman","I mean, Sustainable Solutions really have two sides of safety and operational consulting business, and it has been an environmental business. It really helps company deal with their environmental streams, sulfur and things like that in a very sustainable way.","And we\u2019ve done some acquisitions Mark positions over the year and ECF was one of them, so really added to their capability. They get strong order book coming out of 2012. We\u2019re seeing that stakeholders and based on regulatory issues around the world, companies need to utilize technologies to clean up their way stream. So the Cleantech part of it had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter and a strong prospects going forward.","So I think that came through in a really great job of broadening their base globally and really effecting very positive outcome with their customers, and I think we\u2019re seeing that on our top line and bottom line for that business.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Good morning. This is Rob Walker in for Laurence.","Ellen Kullman","Hi, Rob.","Robert Walker \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi. I guess, first will be in terms of the free cash flow in 2013, what are your expectations for the pension contribution to the principal U.S. plan, as well as working capital use and any cash charges for the restructuring?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","So as far as the pension contribution goes, the map 21 is having a favorable impact on those discount rates, and we're going to see that favorable impact certainly in this year 2013 and probably into 2014 as well. In 2013, we're not anticipating any contributions to the U.S. principal plan, we\u2019ll still have our routine contributions that we've had in other plans. But the U.S. pension plan zero contributions are anticipated.","Robert Walker \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great, thanks. And then on working capital and then any cash charges for the restructuring above the $300 million number?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Well, working capital we are going to continue to drive productivity. One of the things that I'm very pleased to see is that, productivity is truly institutionalized within the company is in every business and it\u2019s not only fixed cost, it\u2019s working capital productivity. You can see that from the fact that over that three-year period, we did $1.6 billion versus that target of $1 billion. And so that work that effort Rob, is going to continue as we move forward, and we\u2019ll continue to see value come out of that productivity gain. And on the restructuring, I don't see anything there of significance in the cash impact.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes, thank you. Question on Ag-Biotech R&D spending and the productivity there. You mentioned you\u2019re increasing your growth spending on Ag in 2013. I know the biotech is roughly half year your seed R&D budget, but it appears that you've yet to discover a major proprietary biotech trade. So Ellen, is your patience running thin on this lack of progress and is the strategy one of perhaps shifting more to the in-licensing? And then I have a follow-up on in-licensing?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, so I mean we\u2019ve always had a growth strategy relative to biotechnology that included both development of our pipeline and in-licensing. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time personally on it with the team. So it\u2019s a very important part of our future. I\u2019m excited about our pipeline and what I\u2019m seeing coming through it.","As you know, the timelines in that industry are not years or decade \u2013 industry in decades not years type of that or a decade. And I expect to see many advances coming through in the next decade. And so we\u2019re going to gone up full meeting, I guess at the end of February, the team is going to be out, and I\u2019m going to share our entire pipeline update with all of you. And I think to get into the details there really requires the team to do that and we hope that you can join us at the end of February for that.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","One follow-up and that\u2019s \u2013 inter protected soy in South America seems to be one of the major Ag, Biotech growth opportunities. I know you\u2019ve got a seed treatment approach, but this doesn\u2019t seem quite as applications to gene-based approach. So can you grow meaningfully in South American soy without licensing in something like impacted from Monsanto?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, so we look pretty small in soy in Latin America. So I think there is tremendous upside for us. I think the pipeline we continue to focus on to understand how we can deliver. I think, with the breadth of the product line and the combination of what we see, I think there is opportunity. I do think seed treatments is going to be very helpful from that standpoint for the next few years, and you\u2019re going to see biotech price of products and cost reductions late in the decade types of thing. So this is an area we can get into a lot of discussion on when we share up full pipeline.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Just looking at the page six of the press release in the Agriculture segment, you talk about stronger than expected pricing gains, I assume in Latin America. Could you just talk about what drove that relative to your expectations?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, I mean, I think, it basically came from product mix. So, Herculex and things like that, with a higher proportion than what our expectations were and it drove that pricing from that standpoint higher.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, hi, good morning. So coatings companies are seeing their multiple expand like DuPont\u2019s multiple has gone down, probably due to this TiO2 cyclicality. So and in longer-term, is TiO2 a core asset for you, or given that you have best-in-class asset with over flexibility and the size and the scale and expand on its own?","Karen A. Fletcher","Yeah, I mean, so, P.J., TiO2 business is a strong business from a competitive standpoint. If you take a look at our advantages, from our manufacturing process technology versus the others in the industry, we performed very well. It is a above company average performance for us on average over cycle. It is a very high performer at the peak of the cycle, and it\u2019s a little bit below average at the depth of the cycle, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a strong cash generator and it performs very well.","We always do on an ongoing portfolio management process, and understand how everything fits into our portfolio. But this is a very strong business, it\u2019s a very strong cash generator. And I think we have to put it become a holistic standpoint and take a look at it from that direction. So you and we love at it on the upside of the market and we don\u2019t like it on the downside of the market, but if you add it all up, it\u2019s generated tremendous amount of cash flow for our company over the years. ","Operator"," ","Our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","","Good morning. This is Neal Sangani on for Bob. Lot of my questions have been answered, but looking to get a sense of the timing of the share repurchases and if there is any potential for taking a more accelerated route?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis"," ","Yeah. So, Neal this is Nick. So the timing is going to be coincidental with the closing of the Coating sale and we do still anticipate that here in the first quarter. So once that sale closes, we would then execute against the share repurchase. We would look to have that completed probably in the first half of the year would be my guess of when we will be able to execute that full share repurchase. ","Ellen Kullman","John, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we have a question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Patrick Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Yes, good morning. Nick, I want to go back and maybe just for Ellen as well to one of the points you\u2019ve raised about your advantage in TiO2 being your teams play flexibility. Now, traditionally titanium is kind of been priced at parity whether you bought the core quality or the high quality, that\u2019s changed in the last couple of years as the rutiles have gained more price than the ilmenites have. When you look forward, is that a structural change that you think persist or do you think that normalizes over the next several years?","Ellen Kullman  "," ","Duffy, I think that\u2019s a hard one to predict, because when is the next mine is going to open up and what\u2019s it going to have and how can we deal with the ever core products that are going to come out of that mine or out of those mining company deal with the other core products that are coming out of that mine.","In the vagaries of how those two things move together are really subject to kind of the ore that's available from the mines that exist today and when a new mine opens it kind of changes the dynamic there a little bit. We believe that with our manufacturing process technology that allows us to use a wide variety of ores that give us an advantage, because we can play that where we need to, to really develop that flexibility really gives us an optionality that another manufacturers don't have. So whether that gap narrows overtime or widens overtime, I think we strategically think of ore, it\u2019s a very important part of how we play to execute in that business. And I think that gives us the opportunity to really earn well over the cycle first with the competition.","Operator","And this concludes the Q&A portion of the conference call. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ms. Kullman for closing remarks.","Ellen Kullman","Great. Thank you very much.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to review how our company performed in the first quarter and against our growth and value creation plans. Our results for inline with what we expected and communicated to you three months ago.","DuPont reported $1.5 billion of operating earnings or $1.56 per share on revenues of $10.4 billion, our employees executed well against our business plans and face a wide range of market opportunities and challenges in global markets. And despite the challenging environment in Europe and a few other markets, our strategies for long-term growth are working.","In agriculture we had record setting sales and earnings that reflect strong, firmer demand for our products, especially our latest corn seed hybrids and our blockbuster crop protection product Rynaxypyr. We had a strong finish to the growing season in Brazil and took advantage of an early and robust start to the North American growing season to deliver exceptional results and Jim is going to provide more insights about our strong performance in these businesses.","While our agriculture segment hit record levels, our performance chemicals segment, sales and operating earnings were down, in line with what we expected reflecting the widely communicated market adjustments underway in the global titanium dioxide market. While our results here were down significantly from peak levels last year, our titanium dioxide business are into superior cash return on invested capital and did so in the quarter.","We continued to expect market conditions to stabilize around the middle of the year and we saw early signs of that in the first quarter, -- sales volumes or up 8% sequentially, from the fourth quarter of last year. In general uncertainty in industrial markets dampened customer demands in the other businesses. Specifically global automotive builds were down, particularly in Europe, Japan and Korea, additionally demand or material slowed into the photovoltaic's markets declined in China and public sector demand in the US remains soft.","We continue to increase value by driving cost productivity, capitalizing on the integration of our recent acquisitions, launching new high-value products and actively deploying our science in fast growing, emerging markets by collaborating closely with leading local companies. Our cost productivity gains in the first quarter were firmly on track to meet our target of at least $300 million for this year.","Our nutrition and health and industrial biosciences teams have fully integrated our Danisco and Solae\u00a0 acquisition. And we're exceeding our acquisition synergy targets. We have growth programs underway and are excited about the value creation these acquisitions will deliver going forward. Our new product launches in the first quarter continued to reflect the diversity and the richness of DuPont's science and technology capability as we apply innovation to address world needs by increasing food production and quality by improving energy efficiency and providing greater protection for people and the environment. We introduced more than 500 new products this quarter balanced between growth and replacement products and balance across our portfolio of businesses.","In agriculture we introduced new products in seven crops across five continents that will increase agricultural productivity. DuPont is also actively collaborating with value chain partners globally through our 11 newly opened innovation centers. The most recently opened center was in Istanbul, Turkey this month and though these centers -- through these centers that DuPont science connects directly with current and potential customers to collaborate and develop new solutions to meet their needs.","We have hundreds of new products underway and are excited about how we are activating our science to create value for customers and shareholders. In addition, I'd like to highlight that during the quarter we executed the $1 billion share repurchase program that we announced to you last quarter, and today we also announced our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in our dividend.","Lastly, we are reaffirming our full-year 2013 outlook, which I'll address at the end of our call today, and so with that, I will turn things over to Nick, who'll take you through the quarter results in detail. Nick?","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen.","Good morning, everyone. Let's start out with the details of the quarter shown on slide 3. As expected, operating earnings of $1.56 per share were down $0.08 versus the $1.64 in the prior year. This decline reflects lower performance chemicals operating earnings of $0.26 per share, largely due to the decline in global TiO2 prices, and this was partially offset by record results from our agricultural segment.","Consolidated net sales of $10.4 billion increased 2% versus the prior year. Volumes increased 2% led by our agricultural  segment where volumes grew 8%. Additionally, 1% higher local selling prices were the result of value driven pricing in the Ag and Nutrition & Health segments, which were partially offset by declining TiO2 prices.","Currency had a negative 1% impact on the top line primarily due to the weaker Brazilian real and Japanese yen. From a regional perspective, the largest local selling price increases in volume growth were seen in U.S. and Canada and Latin America where our Ag businesses flourished. In Asia Pacific, higher volume in our TiO2 and our packaging and industrial polymers businesses were offset by lower volume in our electronics and communications and chemicals & fluoroproducts businesses. The 6% decline in local selling prices in the region was primarily due to lower TiO2 prices.","In Europe, lower volume was primarily due to poor weather conditions that delayed our Ag sales. However, Ag pricing gains drove  higher local selling prices up but they're partly offset by lower TiO2 prices. This quarter, developing EMEA was our highest growth region, up 15% versus last year reflecting strong Ag sales growth in Eastern Europe.","For more information regarding the company\u2019s sales by geographic region please look at slide 4.","Now let's take a deeper look into the operating earnings for the first quarter. New this quarter, slide 5 provides a segment operating earnings variance analysis. From this, you can see clearly the large impact the Performance Chemicals and Ag segments had on our overall earnings compared to the prior year first quarter. Our remaining businesses were impacted by continued uncertainty in industrial markets. Jim and Carl will provide more details about each of our businesses when they cover the segments.","Moving to slide 6, you can see that the decline in segment operating earnings resulted in a $0.14 per share negative impact on the consolidated results. This $0.14 also includes a negative $0.04 currency impact for the first quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect the second quarter currency impact to also be negative by about $0.02 per share. For the full year, we expect a negative $0.05 currency impact with a $0.01 tailwind in the second half of the year. The $0.03  benefit from lower corporate expenses that you see on slide 6 reflects this quarter's savings from our 2012 restructuring program.","We are on plan to deliver the $300 million in savings that we targeted for 2013. You will see the savings impact more of our results as we progress throughout the year. In addition to the restructuring program, we continue to execute on our cost productivity initiatives throughout all of our businesses. We are well on our way to delivering on our commitment of greater than $300 million for the full year from these initiatives.","As a reminder, this is an addition to the $300 million of savings we expect this year from our restructuring program. In total, both will contribute significantly to offset inflation and help fund our growth investments.","Turning now to the balance sheet in cash on slide 7. First quarter free cash flow was an outflow of $3 billion versus an outflow of $2.2 billion last year. As you recall, our working capital spikes in the first quarter due to normal seasonality of our Ag business. This increase in seasonal outflow versus last year's first quarter was due to lower cash earnings and higher Ag working capital, partially offset by lower pension contributions.","The higher Ag working capital was primarily due to the timing of customer and production growing compensation payments, which were also larger this year due to higher commodity prices.","In the first quarter, we executed a $1 billion share repurchase program which will be completed by the end of this month. We accomplished the share buyback by using a portion of the performance coatings divestiture  proceeds, which we received in February. We used the remainder of the performance coatings proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and this is the primary reason you see our net debt decreasing by $4.5 billion versus this time last year.","Additionally, as Ellen just noted, we announced today that our Board approved a $0.02 per share or 5% increase to our quarterly dividend. This is our 435th consecutive quarterly dividend.","In summary, first quarter results were  in line with our expectations with strong growth in Ag more than offset by lower Ti02 prices.","With that overview of the first quarter, I'll turn the call over to Jim to review our Ag and Nutrition & Health segments, Jim?","James Borel","Thanks Nick. The agriculture segment had a great start to what we expect will be another year of strong growth in both our seed and crop protection businesses, posting another new record for first quarter sales and operating earnings.","Agriculture fundamentals remain solid globally, and we continue to execute to deliver results consistent with our long-term growth plans.","Our results in both businesses were led by a strong start to Northern Hemisphere planting season preparations and a strong finish to the season in Latin America.","On slide eight, sales in agriculture grew 14% to $4.7 billion with volume of 8% and price of 6% net of a small currency headwind primarily in Latin America.","Operating earnings increased 13% to $1.5 billion. Volume and pricing gains were partially offset by higher input costs in seeds pressuring operating margins down slightly. Ag results included about $0.02 per share timing benefit to the first quarter operating earnings primarily due to the accelerated pace of North American corn seed deliveries as compared to last year.","Starting with seeds, first quarter sales grew 14% to a record $3.6 billion. Corn sales in North America led the way as growers have signaled intentions to the USDA to plant about 97 million acres in the U.S. similar to last year. And we are seeing very strong demand for our corn hybrids following last year's strong competitive performance and our order book remains solidly ahead of last year.","Adoption of our industry leading AcreMax integrated and reduced refuge are strong, and we're on track to deliver against our penetration commitments.","We\u2019ve also launched AcreMax Xtreme in 2013 and while introductory volumes are small, we're looking forward to growers experiencing the dual mode above and below ground products on their farms this summer.","Growers across the corn belt have high interest in our AQUAmax Hybrids, which demonstrated a 9% yield improvement against competitors in water limited environments last year. Orders are exceeding  our expectations and we now anticipate that AQUAmax will be planted on about 7 million acres in North America. We're also beginning to extend AQUAmax to Europe and initial interest there is high. Mix improvement from these technologies integrated into our newest genetics put us on track to achieve our plan of 5% to 10% pricing gains in North America.","Last month, USDA Planting Intention Survey indicates growers expected plan about 77 million acres of soybeans, and while soybeans sales impact operating earnings more in the second quarter as they are typically planted later than corn, we are on track for another successful season with orders tracking similar to last year.","Turning to Brazil, we continue to see the results of our multiyear investment in growth strategy paying off. First quarter for us is primarily where sales for the safrinha season impact our financial results.","Growers in Brazil planted a record number of corn hectors in the safrinha planting season and it likely exceeded the summer season corn plantings for the first time. When a planting date is finalized we expect we will gain share following a multipoint gain - share gain in the 2012 summer season.","Farmers in Brazil continue to adopt our newest technology at a rapid pace. New genetics, native praise and innovative solutions like intersect which reaches two modes of action of both ground insect control our creating value.","We expect intersect products to represent about a third of our corn sales in 2013. And for the entire safrinha season we grew sales over 40% from higher volume and strong pricing gains.","Our crop protection business had a strong first quarter also exceeding $1 billion in quarterly sale for the first time. Crop protection sales grew 17% in a quarter approaching $1.1 billion, volume gain with the primary driver that price also increase in each region on the strength of new product launches.","Regionally North America led the growth with sales up 60%, in North America we saw a strong preseason demand across all product portfolios bolstered by high grower planning intentions and good crop prices. Demand for soybean preemergance herbicide was strong, we continued to experience strengthening mutual success with our go-to-market approach working together with Pioneer in the U.S. corn soybean market. We're very excited about the new launch of our picoxystrobin disease control product Aproach in the U.S., Acapela in Canada as leading contributors to our rapid growth in North America.","We also saw strong Crop Protection, sales growth across Latin America with sales up 30%, insect pressure was intense and corn soybean is creating strong demand for our Rynaxypyr and indoxacarb insect control solutions. Rynaxypyr continues to grow in all regions in countries and we're on plan to exceed $800 million in sales this year. In addition, the new launch of Cyazypyr insect control products from same innovative classic chemistry as Rynaxypyr continues to deliver exceptional field performance results expanding our portfolio and breadth of insect control innovations.","We continue to make investments in our leading crop protection R&D pipeline, and the first quarter results demonstrate our focused strategy for growth is working. As we look to the second quarter we expect sales growth similar to the first quarter anticipating a strong finish to the Northern Hemisphere grand planting season, we expect earnings to be up moderately despite the $0.02 per share impact from early North American corn deliveries in the first quarter.","Additionally, we expect operating margins in the second quarter to decline 1 to 2 point versus the prior, year primarily from higher input prices and soybeans which represents a larger portion of second quarter sales.","Lastly, we'll continue to make strategic growth investments in both businesses. Grower planning intensions are high, our order book is strong and we have good supplies of seed and crop protection products positioned in the market. Air and soil temperatures have been cooler in the early spring this year whether in the next few weeks will be in important factor and determining whether acres are planted as intended, we'll remain close to our customers through planting we're in the best position in the industry to meet change in grower needs.","Now let's turn to slide 9, and review our Nutrition & Health segment which includes enablers, Health and Protection and Protein Solutions businesses. Sales of $868 million were up 7% on pricing gains and volume growth. Sales were particularly in the emerging markets growing double digits in all three businesses. Operating earnings of $76 million were down $3 million, the sales growth was offset by higher raw material costs primarily guar and enablers. Global market fundamentals remain solid and we saw pricing and volume gains across all three businesses,","Health and Protection and Protein Solutions both delivered strong results in growing pricing volume laid by very strong probiotics and specialty protein sales. Productivity remains a clear focus and costs and operation synergies are on track with our plans.","Turning to the outlook, we anticipate similar sales growth in the second quarter as demand indicators and market fundamentals remain solid and in line with the first quarter. Operating earnings in the second quarter are expected to be flat as high cost for inventory Enablers will continue to pressure margins partially offset by productivity efforts. As we look to the second half of the year we expect margins to improve as raw material costs normalized.","Now we'll turn it over to Carl.","Carl Lukach","Okay, thanks Jim. I'll cover the remaining segments beginning on slide 10 with Electronics & Communications. Sales of $616 million decline 9% primarily due to lower sales into photovoltaics as market share gains were more than offset by reduced material usage by module manufacturers. Operating earnings of $49 million were down $10 million on the lower sales. For the second quarter, we anticipate sales will be down significantly and operating earnings down substantially versus a very strong 2Q last year.","Although PV module production is expected to be flat for the year in the second quarter module production is forecast to be down 15% versus last year's strong second quarter when inventories were building. We also believe the trend have reduced materials usage at module makers will continue. We anticipated second half results will benefit from sequential increase in module production and stronger demand in consumer electronics driven by smartphones and tablets.","Moving to slide 11, sales in our Industrial Biosciences segment were essentially flat at 289 million on 1% higher prices offset by 1% decline in volume. Strong demand and higher prices for Sorona in carpeting and growth in food enzymes were largely offset by lower enzyme volumes for ethanol.","Operating margins are $41 million, were up 5% and margins improved on lower input costs and discipline costs management. For the second quarter sales are expected to be up modestly on new technology launches. Strong demand for Sorona expected to continue and growth in detergents and food enzymes partially offset by continued softness in ethanol.","We expect demand for enzymes for ethanol to remain soft into the second half of the year until producer margins improved. Our operating earnings are expected to be significantly higher from sales growth and continued synergies.","Now let's discuss performance chemicals on slide 12. Sales of approximately $1.6 billion, were down 17% due to 11% decline in price and a 6% volume drop. The decline in price primarily reflects lower Ti02 prices. All of the volume decline was attributable to Chemicals & Fluoroproducts reflecting a lower industrial demand and schedule plant shut downs. TiO2 volumes were essentially unchanged year over year, but up 8% on a sequential basis.","Operating earnings decline 56% for $320 million largely in line with our expectations versus last year's peak level. Turning to the second quarter, operating earnings are expected to be down for substantially similar to the decline in the first quarter results. Due to lower year over year Ti02 prices. While demand patterns remain dynamic and evolving we believe Ti02 demand is stabilizing as the year progresses with improving industry fundamentals and the absence of customer destocking, while there is uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery, we continue to believe that the market will bottom around the middle of this year.","Publish report indicate a gradual but steady decline in producer inventory levels. Coupled with stable to improving demand outlook it provides us renewed confidence that the sequential margin contraction experienced in the past three quarters is a big.","Turning now to performance materials on slide 13, sales of $1.6 billion were down 3% with 1% higher volumes offset by 3% lowers prices. Sales of (inaudible) polymers grew 10% with strength in non food packaging and consumer applications providing top line growth for the packaging and industrial polymers business unit. Volumes in performance polymers declined 4% due to weakness in automotive sales in Europe and Japan partially offset by strong sales in China and ASEAN due to continue penetration at Kia OEMs.","Operating earnings of $292 million increased 5% primarily due to lower feedstock cost. Higher sales volumes in packaging markets were partially offset by weak demand in Europe and Japan automotive markets. For the second quarter sales and operation earnings are forecasted to be essentially flat with auto built down in Europe, and Japan offsets by gains in North America and China.","On slide 14, we'll cover the safety and protection segments. Sales were down 4% on lower volume in price primarily reflecting lower spending in the U.S public sector. As well as to continued uncertainty in industrial markets, operating earnings decreased $21 million, primarily due to weaker sales mix and lower plant utilization partially offset by productivity gains. For the second quarter we expect sales and operating earnings to decline modestly year-over-year, reflecting market conditions similar to the first quarter. However operating earnings and margins are expected to improve sequentially from the first quarter to the rest of the year due to our productivity action the U.S housing market rebound and improving demand in industrial and public sector markets.","This concludes the segment updates, so I'll turn the call back to Ellen now.","Ellen Kullman","Great thank you Carl. Let me close by providing you with some insights about what underpins our outlook. Starting with the second quarter as Jim mentioned we did see about $0.02 per share timing benefit in the first quarter from an accelerated pace of corn seed deliveries in North America this will impact our second quarter. On the top line we expect second quarter market conditions to be similar to what we saw on the first quarter. Solid fundamentals and agriculture Nutrition & Health Industrial Biosciences as well as continued demand uncertainties from industrial market.","On our bottom-line, we expect strong growth again in our agricultural segment and tough comparisons to prior year peak level in Performance Chemicals. Consistent with what we discussed in January, we expect the first half operating earnings per share will be about 7% to 9% lower than last year. Going to the full-year, we are reaffirming our full guidance of $3.85 a share to $4.05 a share which is a 2% to 7% growth from last year.","Growth fundamentals in agriculture markets remained solid, and we expect our product lines to perform very well. As a result, we anticipate low teen growth in sales for the full year, from our agricultural segment. We expect the food and beverage industry to continue to general stable, global demand for our nutrition and health and industrial biosciences products and anticipate increasing our market penetration in these markets led by superior value propositions of our product offerings.","For Ti02 as I mentioned, we anticipate supply and demand in the global market to stabilize around the year so in that point, resume a growth trajectory which has been tracked historically to GDP growth. We also anticipate improvements in demand in the second half from industrial market. This is based on our evaluations of country and regional forecast for general industrial production, auto production, home building and construction, solar module production and other markets. Data for these market show negative or no growth in the first quarter but a forecasted to grow several percentage points for the year.","Examples include global auto builds, industrial production and Photovoltaic Modules production. This means, we will see sequential improvement in demand as the year progresses, which we're ready for in a positively impact many of our businesses, like protection technologies, performance polymers and chemicals and floor products. You will continue to see cost savings from our restructuring program and our ongoing productivity initiatives, which helps offset inflation and fund growth initiatives. And we are committed to these car brands and believe they are returning real value to our shareholders. And what remained stead fast on our current track of deploying our science to bring it consistent, steady flow of new product to global market that solve real market need. They offer strengthen our market position, improve customer satisfaction all at higher values for customers and shareholders.","So in closing, our first quarter results were as expected and communicated to you three months ago. In addition, we reaffirmed our full year outlook we purchased $1 billion of stock, reduced DuPont's net debt 4.5 billion and raised our dividends, actions that reflect our priority and confidence and our ability to execute our business plans. It always comes down to staying close to the customers, understanding their underlined demand signaled and disciplined execution. Our indicators are signaling gradual improvement in demand as we progress through the year. So we must remain agile and quick to respond at customer demand improves, which is exactly what we will do.","So Carl, back to you.","Carl Lukachfa","Okay, John we're ready to go to the calls and take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, and we I will begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. In terms of outlook Ellen, I just wanted to clarify that the first half, I think it was previously down 3% to 7% and is expected to be down 7% to 9%, is that consistent with the message that you're trying to get across versus pervious or is that an artifact of the change in pension accounting?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, so we never gave a number range in our January call. We said it will be down, I don\u2019t remember the word we used\u2026.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","I think it was modestly.","Ellen Kullman","Right. So we're getting more specific based on the impact to the volatility of Performance Chemicals and some other factors like the higher commodity prices, and we thought it'd be helpful to you to get more specific at this point in time about the first half of the year. ","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Ok. That makes sense. Thanks for clarification.","Ellen Kullman","So it's consistent with what we were seeing or thinking starting in January.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Okay, then may be more detailed question to Jim, Monsanto has been on a partnering, licensing frenzy lately, including of course with DuPont, it appears that they will have the optionality through one or more of these agreements for all of the major next gen herbicides, you know, Liberty, Enlist, Dicamba and so forth in corn, soybeans, and other major real crops, can you walk us through DuPont's rationale on this subject and how important in Enlist and Dicamba is for corn over the next couple of years and do soybeans need a Dicamba trade as well?","Jim Borel","Sure. First of all, as you know, what matters to a farmer is a product that really performs and has the kind of flexibility and yield performance that they're looking for so. So, the agreement with Monsanto is a nice addition, it gives us additional product options and additional modes of weed control to be able to offer, and we expect that plus the stacking flexibility will help enable us to make even better performing products that will give more value to customers over time. So I think overall we feel really good about the opportunities that it allows us to pursue.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","","Hi, good morning it's actually, Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Question about the balance sheet. Following the divestitures of the coatings business, it significantly strengthened and with about $6.5 billion  of cash, seems like you have a lot to deploy, we're just hoping for an update on how the acquisition pipeline is looking and what kind of acquisitions you'll be looking to pursue in this environment.","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, I mean thank you, Brian. We have been really consistent about how we talked about acquisitions. There are things that really have to advance, either our science or market penetration in key markets where we see our science is going to make a difference. So, I think you've seen that, whether it's in large ones like Danisco, or whether it's in small ones  like Pannar, which gives us the opportunity to extend well into Sub-Saharan Africa with our agriculture segment or things like Innovalight,  which give us the silicon ink that  really enhances the efficiency from a PV standpoint.","So, we continue to have a strong activity in the company looking at various areas; nutrition and health, agriculture, industrial biosciences, advanced materials where we think that it's either science and\/or market penetration can help, and let me just be clear about what I'm looking for. I'm looking to create a trajectory or momentum. I'm looking to create a greater opportunity for our company by doing this, not just creating bulk, but really creating momentum. And so, we do see acquisition as being an important part of our growth plan going forward and continue to focus on those areas.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","Great. One follow up if may, just on the TiO2 business, it looks like your volume is up sequentially 8%. They were a little bit better that you were guiding for last quarter to be kind of flat. Do you think that you're taking some market share in there or is that just more a reflective of the overall market improving that much.","Nick Fanandakis","Hey, Brian this is Nick. I think when you look at what is going on in the TiO2, it's really playing  out very much like we had anticipated. The destocking from our customer inventory levels that's at a normal basis now, so that is done. I think there is still some inventory levels from a producer side based on published data that's out there that suggests that that still has some work to be done, but it's moving in the right direction and it's in line with the statement when we say that we believe things will hit that stable normal level by the end of the first half of this year. ","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you and good morning. Ellen, if I could just ask you your -- you made a couple of comments about the outlook, and I thought I would try to tie two of them  together, one was about second half improving fundamentally in general, and the second piece was, you said it was all about talking to your customers. and so I just wanted to see is the conversations you're having with your customers that are giving you the confidence in a better looking second half outlook and sort of leave aside agriculture relative to some of the sort of not so great macroeconomic indicators we\u2019re seeing or some of the commentary we\u2019re seeing out of other industrial and materials companies?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah so let me talk about the macro, then we will go down to the customer level. So if you think about industrial production only being up 1% in the first quarter versus what economists are continuing to focus on which says 2% to 2.5% for the year. If you think about automotive globally being down 1 in the first quarter, being up may be 1 in the second quarter, it's going to be actually up 4 in the second half of the year to meet the build, and so, there are the macro indicators there. Now, if you go down and you talk to automotive, if you talk to people down our value chain, they feel that there is just -- I wouldn't call it a great change, but a building of a little more confidence. And so I think that's what we are seeing, China infrastructure, for example, they have come out and -- their government has come out and said they're going to install 10 gigawatts of solar modules as part of their infrastructure this year.","Now, we didn\u2019t see any of that in the first quarter, but we see activity and hopefully that will lead to that and that will be good for our electronics business, and so we do see it coming from different ways. Now, again it's a wait and see basis, and I am a very practical person, I'd like to see it more tangibly, but all our forward looking indicators in that area are showing signs of sequential slow improvement, which at the end of day -- that's why the word values are cautiously optimistic.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's helpful, thank you. And Jim if I could just ask you quickly, a question I get a lot now if USDA is right and  corn goes to 480 next year. Could you speak a little just holistically about how you think that would impact sort of the germ plasm  pricing opportunity for next year?","Jim Borel","Sure. First of all, even at that price, farmers are still incented to maximize yield. In fact you could say yield becomes even more important at a lower price. Technology adoption is still going to continue and that's a big piece of what drives price, and we should see in that scenario a benefit on COGS, so as long as we stay in a range that's profitable for farmers even the lower prices is not necessarily bad, it is still incentive to maximize productivity and that's where we hope farmers do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquahanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquahanna Financial","Thank you. Nick, you used to provide sort of consolidated delta between EPS impact of price versus variable cost. So I just wondering what that\u2019s the overall company and more specifically just wondering you haven't really commented on the cost situation in TiO2 so what's headwinds do you face this year on margins due to higher ore cost and lower capacity utilization?","Nick Fanandakis","Yeah, thanks. We've looked at Don changing our reporting system simplifying our report system, so we're no longer cracking inventory streams all the way through the chain to the consolidated level. Obviously, we though we continue to analyze this in depth at the plans where its more impactable with the data. You talk about TiO2and raw material cost there. Our ore cost are higher due to some of the legacy contracts expiring, but we're still very much in an advantaged position when you look at us versus our overall competitive base largely driven by our technology and our ability as we've said many times to consume the lower grade ore as well as higher grade ore to make higher grade TiO2.","Don Carson - Susquahanna Financial","Just a follow up, how much are you anticipating your TiO2 cost to be up this year?","Nick Fanandakis","The ore isn't going to be the major driver on the costs. If you look at the total company, you're probably looking about 3% to 4% range on rose.","Operator","And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Ellen, On TiO2 is just still as core as it used to be?","Ellen Kullman","David, how are you today?","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Good, thank you.","Ellen Kullman","Good, I heard you put publisher report yesterday but anyway, asked question a lot, and as you know we continually evaluate all our business, just we expect them to drive innovation science into the marketplace to differentiate themselves from the competition and as you saw in our last couple years, if we find the business its not measuring up we take those decisions very seriously so I will talk about Ti02.","We have advantage process technology gives us the sustainable competitive advantage no matter where we are in the cycle therefore we earn superior cash returns on our invested capital through the entire cycle and move well above our cost of capital even after trough so if we have strong cash flow so we can use that cash flow in many ways in the company whether it\u2019s to invest in research and development or other growth investments.","Counter balancing that is the volatility it is the cyclical business and the turns are very difficult to predict and I know that\u2019s what drive everyone to the distraction. So we continually evaluate all of our businesses and as always we will do what's in the best interest for the shareholder.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And just Jim just on corn seed market share as a current USGA forecast where you see gain share this year or just whole share?","Jim Borel","Thanks Dave. First of all its way too early to start to comment about share since very little plan actually has been done but as I mentioned our order book is all of the ahead of last year we feel good with our position but what we need to get through the season to be able to be firm up what actually will happen with share?","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan","Jeff Zekauskas- JP Morgan","Hi, good morning. The other income in the quarter was 92 million versus 14 in the year ago or I think about $0.06 benefit. What was that? And how does that affect the segment income that is how does that other income get reflected through the segments?","Ellen Kullman","So, I know that farmer was down 23 million quarter-over-quarter.","Jim Borel","We had some one time things last quarter that weren\u2019t there this quarter in the way of sales that showed up another income Jeff.","Ellen Kullman","","So let me get back to you but I don\u2019t have the specifics right here, so we\u2019ll comeback on that.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Okay great. Secondly, Safety & Protection has been now the strongest that might be, if what you do is you just [high wall] of the offshore operations in Safety & Protection and just look at the North American performance how did North American sales grow in the first quarter and how did North American operating income fair?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah, so, we can talk about sales but not operating income because if the fact of the matter is our plans most of them are located EMEA, United States and we do a tremendous amount of exporting out up in the United States in the other areas of the world. And in Safety & Protection in North America we\u2019re seeing progression based not only on a continuation of our focused on commercial construction but the start up of some higher opportunities in housing starts and build both in the Korean and in the Taiwan product line. We\u2019re seeing softness in the first responder and the military area in the United States that kind we\u2019ve \"one tenders\" but they haven\u2019t release the orders yet and how sequestration effects that we don\u2019t think so and we do expect that to pick up as the years go on.","So in addition to that we have the productivity efforts that are starting to come true when you will margin expansion in that area. So we have some positives from standpoint of construction we have some negatives like first responder that area net, net sales in the quarter or probably flat to up very modestly.","Operator","Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Good morning. Just a quick question on the Ag business you indicated there was a little bit of a pull forward I believe it was $0.2 tie to North American corn. But you also mentioned I guess  in the prepared remarks that whether in Europe had pushed out some Ag business so was that $0.2 a net number or is there maybe a little bit of tailwind excluding that going into because of the European weather?","Nick Fanandakis","Yeah, that\u2019s North America it\u2019s larger impact. In Europe what we are seeing is its cold and wet so as it relates to see some of planning\u2019s are delayed a little bit in terms of Crop Protection some of the winter crops some of the early sprays that where have been going on late in the first quarter haven\u2019t gone, we'll see how the second quarter, how the season develops as we go into the second quarter. So but North America was by far the larger impact.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","","Great. And then just a quick follow up on the Nutrition & Health business, you had indicated that [Goar] was a headwind for you in your Enablers business. I think if we\u2019re right on this Goar spiked up a lot last year and if we should be largely true that so I guess I am wondering how much inventory do you have left that, how much longer do we see headwinds here before that becomes what should be a pretty significant tailwind?","Nick Fanandakis","","Yeah. We\u2019re expecting to be through that during the second quarter as I mentioned and so as the second half progresses we should - that should larger be behind us.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy - Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Couple of quick questions on Ag first for Jim, you indicated AquaMax targeted acreage up to 7 million now I think from 5 million previously, can you comment on the sources that upside whether that puts you in a sold out position for the year and how high you think that acreage can go at maturity for the product?","Jim Borel","","First of all, as I mentioned we\u2019re seeing great demand based on the performance last year and so we have big supplies, demand are strong, we have big supplies to fill that, it will see where it ends up as the season progresses. In terms of ultimate peak, we haven\u2019t sized that but this generation is really aimed at areas that are particularly water stressed in the western Corn Belt. And so it\u2019s aim that fairly targeted area. There is some upside as well in Europe that we\u2019re starting to introduce it in some early interest particularly in France.","Kevin McCarthy - Merrill Lynch","The clarification that if I may on your implied guidance for the second quarter I guess $1.32 to a $1.336, you talked about timing issues, 1Q versus 2Q I\u2019m wondering if the target for the June quarter reflects any expected timing issues in Ag out of the second quarter and into the third given the cool wet start to the planning season?","Jim Borel","Now, at this point we would expect this season to have normalize itself during the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Nocella from RBC Capital Markets.","Chris Nocella - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Regionally you had strong 4% volume growth in the U.S. how much was it up excluding Ag? And in Asia you had flat volumes of a pretty easy comp last year. So can you just kind of walk us through you\u2019re seeing there?","Ellen Kullman","So we\u2019ll start with Asia first. So in Asia volumes for flat it was a tale of two cities, developed Asia was down 5% on volume based on things like automotive builds in Japan and Korea seeing off substantially. And then we had obviously 5% growth in developing Asia with things like strength in India, strength in China and things like automotive. And so Asia was very much a mixed bag, so on average it was zero but it was a tale two cities and developing areas still making great progress, and then developed areas specifically Japan and Korea struggling. If you look at North America I'd say agriculture we\u2019re pretty flat except for [Ti02]where we had a shut down that impacted some of our volumes there in one of our businesses. But it was flat to up one outside if Ag and I think that answers your question.","Chris Nocella - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, it also seems like you\u2019re having some challenges in some other parts of the firm is chemical segment as well. So I just wondering where your outlook for those businesses are in addition to Ti02?","Ellen Kullman","Yeah. So from refreezement standpoint we\u2019re coming into season. Right, so second quarter is seasoned for refreezering, who are polymers, our volumes were of there and that scenario where there is I think industrial the slow down or I think uncertainty and industrial markets are impacting the performance polymers standpoint. You know about DDT, we talked about titanium dioxide and industrial chemicals and things like cyanide which is making great progress and things like anilines which we have some slowness due to our outage. So everything we see in the second half should pick up as industrial production picks up in this segment.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi ","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yes, hi, good morning. The question on photo Voltatex you expect appears to be down substantially in second quarter but expect the second half recovery. Can you just tell us what's going on with the margin make up in China and how confident are you of this recovery? ","Ellen Kullman","So what I would tell you is in PV confidence would not be the word I would use because it's bumpy and it has been bumpy, but we use the best external published data we have, we stay close with the module manufacturers and people down the value chain. And try to use the best information we can get in order to forecast. Now the second quarter of last year was a very strong year. I mean there was lot of over production in hindsight in that second quarter and that' why the cost this year were stating that in the second quarter that's going to be off some 15%, the module production will be off 15%. Worse we are forecasting the PV installed will be flat for the year, and so what that it means there has to be some progression coming through the year and it will improve in the third quarter and improve again in the fourth quarter, so Dave Miller who leave that businesses have some of the best data and in this area that I have ever seen, and we stay very close to it because it is as we said bumpy and that all indicators are now improvement through the second half of the year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Great, thank you. On TiO2 quickly I think Nick you mentioned that inventories are declining. Can you just quantify that? And when do you see pricing improvement in the industry? Thank you.","Nick Fanandakis","Well, I will not comment on pricing per se, I'll comment on the market dynamics as a whole. And as I said when you look at the published data that\u2019s out there around inventory levels, it would suggest that this probably still may be around 10-15 days of excess inventory at the producer level versus the normalized sort of state. And I believe that excess can be brought back in line by the end of the first half of the year or the second quarter. There is already been tremendous progress made in this area of moving producer level down towards the normalized level that I spoke of.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","Hey, good morning, Ellen. I'm big just Gordan fan and I am not seeing DuPont - I thought you handle that very well this morning - I do have question and it actually relate little bit to the balance sheet being so strong and in effect you guys went to marketing and got some cheap debt as well, and obviously you're looking at M&A but what are your thoughts about more balanced approach with share buyback as part of the mix as well.","Nick Fanandakis","Yeah Franc this is Nick. How are you doing?","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","Great","Nick Fanandakis","Good. Hey when you look at the balance sheet, you're right we did reduce our debt level. Our net debt went from a year ago March $11 billion reduced about $4.5 billion this March largely driven by the proceeds from the DPC sales as well as productivity gains that we continue to drive in the company. Our target here Frank is pretty clear. We want to maintain a strong balance sheet, and I define that strong balance sheet as the AA2 rating. When you take into account as the credit rating agencies do the pension, the unfunded pension portion and you include that in product you're adjusted net debt calculation with the changes that we see now in our balance sheet and strengthening now with the proceeds we come to that position where I feel more comfortable around that AA2 sort of rating. That obviously gives us a strong balance sheet with the flexibility to do things that we find could be creating additional value whether that be acquisitions or capital projects et cetera. Keep in the mind - Frank keep in the mind we just did complete the $1 billion share buyback or will complete it end of this month.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","Alright, but not likely to see another program announce anytime in the near future?","Nick Fanandakis","Well, I have an ongoing program around here buyback that handles anti-dilutive effect and I still have $1.7 billion from board authorization that's available to me on that program.","Operator","Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","Yes. Good morning. I just, Ellen if you could talk about year-over-year changes if you look at first half versus second half with your implied guidance, first half this year is down $0.25 of EPS, second half is up a little over $0.40 just triangulating those numbers, with ag being seasonally weak and being your best year-over-year performer, what are the big buckets of improvement in the second half where you can grow earnings so much more substantially versus the down earnings in the first half ","Ellen Kullman","Well if you remember Duffy, the second half of last year was quite slow in the industrial market. And so those are markets will start there that we believe where we will see slow sequential improvement on so if you take a look at automotive being flat in the first half of the year being up 4% in the second half of the year, it's going to have a positive impact not only in our safety and protection business our performance power in those business and also our chemical and floor product business.","If you think about US housing, US housing continue to build if you think about TiO2 reaching that bottom and from cyclical standpoint and starting to get back to GDP type of growth in the second half of the year, and a lot of these are predicted on what we're seeing, you know, one of the drivers is industrial production only 1% growth and industrial production in the first quarter and our economists and others that I [read] they're sticking with 2% and 2.5% for the year.","So we need to see that modest sequential improvement in the areas that I discussed, plus to continue delivery against our plans in agriculture, in nutrition and health and industrial biosciences. We have plan there very specifically led out quarter-by-quarter and must say need to accomplish and we think that's how those numbers forecast being what you said.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","Okay, and then we spend a lot of time talking Ag and TiO2 because they move big incremental drive a lot, but if you separate all the rest to the company and you look at those five segments and strip out the commodities or take TiO2 out of performance chemical take the ethylene crack rather performance materials, in the first half five of these six segments would be down in our up earning looking at that without the commodity that's including Ag, so when you look across our broad based so was growth in the world, and that's one of thing when you talked to investor to get more portfolio you need to see that growth across a lot of these performance segments that doesn't seemed to be there now, so when you handicap that what's need to be done to get the rest of non Ag , non TiO2 to be DuPont going ","Ellen Kullman","Right, I do think it seems like automotive production, it's down 1% globally so although we saw great up vying growth in China, we saw negative growth in Japan and Korea. And so going from flat year-over-year bill to plus 4% in the second half of the year is one of the key. I think that if you think about general industry you think about all of the areas that are going on up there, whether it's in aircraft production or in industrial side motor transport, if China does continue with their stated objective where they tend to go out to module installation in their infrastructure and things like their transportation sector which impacts us versus safety and protection and performance material we'll see enough lift in the second half of the year. And I think that's why I am cautiously optimistic. We've lot of external signs, we're starting to hear things through our value chain, we needed to that reflected it's so early in the year but I am cautiously optimistic ","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. And I'll turn it back over you Carl, for an update on Investor Day.","Carl Lukach","Okay, John, thanks. Thanks John for that, thanks everyone.

Thank you for joining us for our discussion of DuPont's second quarter and first half 2017 performance. Here with me are Ed Breen, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Collins, Executive Vice President responsible for our Agriculture segment. The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release.","During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements. I direct you to slides one and two for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures.

Third, Jim will discuss our Agriculture business. We will then take your questions.","With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we continued the momentum we generated in the beginning of the year and delivered a strong second quarter. We, again, drove top and bottom line growth, including volume increases across the board and strong margin growth. The gains were driven by our productive innovation pipeline as well as favorable market conditions in Electronics & Communications, Performance Materials, and Protection Solutions.","The second quarter's highlights were: total sales of $7.4 billion rose 5%, which was all organic growth. Segment operating earnings increased 9%. Operating earnings per share grew 11%. We delivered volume gains in all reportable segments and segment operating margins improved about 80 basis points. Volume increases of 6% were the key growth driver to this quarter. Our focus on growth markets and new products is translating into strong results across the board. Agriculture was a large contributor to the volume gains, which Jim will cover.","Electronics & Communications growth was driven by film and laminate applications in consumer electronics markets, coupled with strength in semiconductor and photovoltaics. In Protection Solutions, our volume increase primarily came from applications of Tyvek and Nomex with Tyvek active packaging as one new example.","Industrial Biosciences generated volume growth largely from growth in biomaterials led by Sorona sales and apparel with bioactives up as well. Our 11% growth in operating earnings per share reflected the volume great gains as well as operating margin expansion. Electronics & Communications, Industrial Biosciences, and Ag led our operating margin growth. And Nick will cover our segment results in more depth in a moment.","We also delivered a strong first half for 2017 with sales up 5%, gross margins up 45 basis points, segment operating margins up about 170 basis points, and operating earnings per share of 21% versus prior year. In addition, free cash flow year-to-date improved by about $200 million, excluding the additional pension contributions we made.","It's with strong momentum that we have what we anticipate to be our last earnings news release and investor call as DuPont. Of course, this is not an ending but a beginning as we approach the expected August closing of the merger with Dow to form DowDuPont. This past quarter, we completed nearly all the steps needed to close the merger without any significant new remedies. When the final steps are completed, we will announce our expected closing date. We remain confident that the transaction will close in August.","Our extensive integration planning will assure that, when the merger closes, DowDuPont can immediately begin launching the projects to achieve our cost synergy target of $3 billion and stand up the strong independent companies we intend to create. Meanwhile, the Dow and DuPont boards have begun a comprehensive portfolio review for DowDuPont, which we announced in May. The lead independent directors of each company working closely with the CEOs are leading the process assisted by McKinsey. We will update you when the process concludes.","DuPont is entering the final weeks leading up to the merger with solid momentum. Going forward, we expect the combination of two great companies and the intended subsequent separations to unlock significant value for shareholders, creating independent companies equipped to continue as growth leaders in attractive market segments.","Now with that, let me turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thank you, Ed. Beginning with slide 3, second quarter and first half operating earnings per share reflect continued strong top and bottom line performance in the segments, primarily driven by volume growth. Operating earnings per share of $1.38 in the quarter increased 11%, while operating earnings per share of $3.02 in the first half increased by 21%.","The business continued to drive productivity as demonstrated by operating cost declining about 100 basis points in the first half as a percentage of sales on an operating earnings basis. As a percentage of sales, SG&A cost declined about 70 basis points and corporate cost declined about 40 basis points.","Consolidated net sales for the quarter of $7.4 billion increased 5% versus prior year driven by a 6% increase in volume partially offset by 1% lower local price. All of our reportable segments had volume growth in the quarter with Agriculture, Electronics & Communications, and Protection Solutions leading the way.","Consolidated net sales for the first half of $15.2 billion increased 5%, all on volume growth. Sales grew in most segments led by Agriculture, Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications.","Slide 4 outlines our growth from a regional perspective in both the second quarter and first half. In the quarter, we grew North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, while sales in Latin America were down versus prior year. Growth in North America was primarily driven by Agriculture, while growth in Asia-Pacific was primarily due to Electronics & Communications and Performance Materials.","For the first half, we saw strong growth in each region led by improvements in Asia Pacific and North America. Strength in consumer electronics and semiconductors, coupled with increased demand for polymers in automotive drove the improvement in Asia-Pacific. In North America, Agriculture led the way, driven by benefits from the timing of seed deliveries, increased insecticide and fungicide sales, and higher soybean seed sales.","On slide 5, I want to highlight that the primarily driver of earnings per share growth in the second quarter is segment results, which contributed $0.13 to the quarter. Volume growth in all of our segments resulted in an increase in segment operating earnings.","Turning to slide 6 for the first half results. Consistent with the quarter, segment results drove the year-over-year improvement in operating earnings, contributing $0.37 per share to the first half. Top line organic growth in most of our segments improved segment operating earnings.","Exchange gains and losses contributed $0.07 per share to the first half results. The benefit is primarily due to the absence of prior year currency devaluations in both the Ukraine and Argentina. Lower net corporate and interest expenses added $0.04 to earnings per share in the first half, primarily due to cost savings and higher interest income on marketable securities.","A lower tax rate added $0.03 to operating earnings in the first half, primarily reflecting a benefit associated with the adoption of a recent accounting pronouncement. As we noted in the first quarter, the company adopted this new guidance regarding accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Lower average shares outstanding contributed $0.02 per share to the first half.","Now let's turn to second quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide 7. Segment operating earnings increased $144 million, or 9% in the quarter versus last year, with operating margin expansion of about 80 basis points. Growth in Agriculture, Electronics & Communications, and Industrial Biosciences drove the improvement in the quarter.","Turning to slide 8 for the first half, segment operating earnings increased $418 million, or 13%, with operating margin expansion of about 170 basis points. More than half of the improvement was due to Agriculture, which Jim will cover in more detail.","Performance Materials' operating earnings increased $86 million. Volume growth of 6% was driven by increased demand for polymers in global automotive markets and high-performance parts in semiconductor and aerospace markets. Operating margins in this segment expanded by about 175 basis points year-over-year.","Electronics & Communications' operating earnings increased $53 million. Volumes grew 14% in the first half, driven by demand in consumer electronics and semiconductor markets, as well as stronger photovoltaic material sales. Operating margins improved by 335 basis points in the first half.","Industrial Bioscience operating earnings increased $26 million. Top line organic growth of 9% reflected volume and local pricing gains in biomaterials and bioactives. Operating margins expanded by 210 basis points in the first half. Nutrition & Health results increased $22 million. Growth in probiotics was offset by declines in systems and texturants and protein solutions, resulting in volumes that were flat versus prior year.","The business continues to focus its portfolio on higher growth, higher-margin products, such as probiotics and cultures. Plant productivity, mix enrichment, and cost savings drove the improvement in operating earnings. Operating margins in this segment improved by 165 basis points. I refer you to the materials we posted on our website today for further details on segment results.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 9. For the first half, we had negative free cash flow of about $4.6 billion, reflecting $2.8 billion in higher pension contributions, as well as Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow. In May, we completed a $2.7 billion discretionary contribution to our principal U.S. Pension Plan.","When adjusting for the additional pension contributions, our free cash flow increased by about $200 million year-over-year. The improvement is primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, including the first half 2016 prepayment to Chemours for delivery of certain goods and services. Higher merger-related costs partially offset these improvements.","The businesses continue to drive towards best-in-class in relation to working capital. When comparing to the same period last year, business working capital levels remain about flat despite sales growth, as continued improvements in accounts payable were offset by increases in accounts receivable. Our continued focus on productivity has resulted in improvements across each of our business working capital turn metrics year-over-year.","Net debt increased in the first half over our ending 2016 balance, reflecting the $2 billion debt offering we completed in May to fund the pension contribution, as well as our normal seasonal shifts in cash, primarily due to Agriculture.","Before I turn it over to Jim, I wanted to comment on guidance for the remainder of 2017. Given our expected merger closing with Dow in August, it would not be appropriate for us to give guidance for DuPont on a standalone basis. As DowDuPont, there'll be a number of adjustment to segment results such as synergy capture, purchase accounting, alignment of accounting practice, impact and remedies and the anticipated integration of Dow and DuPont businesses within certain segments.","In line with SEC requirements, we will file historical pro forma financial information for DowDuPont subsequent to merger close. As part of the slides for today's presentation, we have included key market commentary for the remainder of 2017 for each of our segments.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide an overview of the results for Agriculture. Jim?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Great. Thanks, Nick. While the Ag markets in 2017 continued to be challenged, our results reflect our ability to deliver value for our customers and growth for our shareholders. In the second quarter, Ag segment sales grew 7% with crop protection sales up 10% and seed sales up 6%. Volume improved by 8% and was driven by a 16% increase in our crop protection business and a 6% increase in our seed business.","The volume gains in crop protection were realized through increased insecticide and fungicide sales with each generating growth in the double digits. Volume improvement in our seed business was driven by the benefit from the southern U.S. route-to-market change and higher soybean sales in North America due to the increase in planting acres. Price was down 1% reflecting competitive pressure in crop protection markets in Latin America and Asia.","Now in the quarter, operating earnings increased 11% as top line growth and cost productivity were partially offset by higher soybean royalty costs. Now in the first half, which represents the majority of the northern hemisphere planting season, Ag segment sales increased 5% with volume up 5% and price up 1%. Portfolio changes negatively impacted sales by 1%.","Crop protection sales were up 7% and seed sales rose 5% in the half. Our operating earnings grew 12%, which translates to about 175 basis point improvement in operating margins. Strong volume growth in the first half was driven by the timing benefit in our seed business, including the southern U.S. route-to-market change, increases in insecticides and fungicide sales, soybean seeds in North America and sunflower and corn seed sales in Europe.","Now this growth was partially offset by the expected decline in corn volumes driven by the reduced corn area in North America. Our price growth was led by a double-digit increase in Brazil driven by the continued penetration of our Leptra corn hybrids and increased pricing in soybeans in North America from the full launch of Pioneer brand Roundup Ready 2 soybeans with Xtend technology.","Xtend soybeans are part of our latest A serious lineup of soybeans, which enables a greater than two-bushel per acre advantage. Both of these new products contributed to a greater than 2% increase in global seed pricing for the first half.","Now in the first half, our crop protection business delivered strong top line growth of 7% amid challenging and highly competitive industry conditions. We are pleased by the continued expansion of Zorvec, one of our latest fungicides, which is targeting peak sales of greater than $200 million and by the launch of Vessarya, a premium fungicide in Brazil for controlling Asian soybean rust, which is also targeting peak sales of greater than $200 million. We have also restored supply of Lannate and Vydate volumes which contributed to the first half growth.","Now volume growth in the half was partially offset by lower local prices driven by competitive pressures in Latin America and Asia. Looking towards the second half from a market perspective, we are anticipating lower planted corn area in Brazil's summer season coming off strong plantings and good yields in the previous summer season, and a sharp decline in domestic commodity prices. These dynamics are causing farmers in Brazil to delay purchase decisions until closer to planting as they scrutinize their cropping plants.","We are also carefully watching the condition of the North America crop during this critical time in the growing season and the impact it could have on summer plantings in South America as well as commodity prices in North America as farmers plan for 2018. As always, we continue to be tuned in to market conditions, and we'll remain agile in order to respond to changing customer needs.","Now I'll close with a brief update on our progress towards the achievement of our 2017 priorities. Our first priority is to achieve our sales, operating earnings and cash commitments and our first half results demonstrate that we're executing well against this goal. Our second priority is to drive rapid and successful technology launches. Evidence of steady progress in this area is shown by the price and volume benefits we realized in the first half and continued expansion of Leptra corn hybrids and Zorvec and new products such as A-Series soybeans and Vessarya.","Our final priority is to prepare to close the merger and execute on integration plans in preparation for the intended separation. We used the first half to further define our projects to deliver the $1 billion in Ag cost synergies, and we will be ready to begin to execute on day one. Now the leadership team of the new business has spent considerable time together ensuring the robustness of the plans and setting the framework for an engaged and collaborative organization.","Bringing together the innovation engines and combining the market access of the two organizations will drive substantial value for our customers and our shareholders. It will be an exciting second half of the year and I'm looking forward to starting the first chapter of the DowDuPont Ag business.","So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Okay, thanks, Jim. We'll now open the line for questions. John, if you could please provide the instructions for those on the phone to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you good morning. Ed, on the review that the new board is doing, can you provide any more color on the process they're going through and potential for some movement of sales, assets and businesses from material co to specialty co? Thank you.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, David. As you all know, we hired McKinsey to assist the board, and so the process is being led by the two lead directors, Sandy Cutler and Jeff Fettig with Andrew and I, obviously, involved also. But we have McKinsey doing a deep dive of study on it.","And our goal is to get that done as quickly as we can so once we merge, we can, as a joint new board, new DowDuPont board, we can assess the outcome of that and move as rapidly as we can on making any decisions. But, obviously, the goal of this is to ensure maximum shareholder value is created, and that's the goal of the study and we'll see where that comes out. But we're moving as expeditiously as we can on that.","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead with your question, Vincent.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry about that. Can you hear me?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My question, Jim. There seems to be a lot of moving parts in Brazilian market, particularly crop chemistry. We saw in the quarter a competitor took an inventory write-down, we know there have been high levels of inventory. It looks like your volume was strong globally, price was down.","And then we've got the farmer may be holding off on inventory purchases and then you're selling some of your crop chemistry down there to somebody else. So how do we assess what's going on, sort of, in the Brazilian market, in general, and then how it's going to impact the DuPont RemainCo Ag business as we move through the rest of this year and into the next year?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thanks for the question. I think there were probably four or five questions in there. So let's start with Brazil. We talked a lot about inventories in the past. And while, I would say, overall industry inventories down there are still a little bit elevated and, yeah, we heard some announcements out there, I'd say our inventories are kind of now back to where I would really like them to be, kind of normal. And I'd say that for the pretty much rest of the world.","We've done a nice job as a team of managing those inventories back to where they need to be. So what you're starting to see then in the quarter is the volume response based on that. So we're picking back up now that volume as we continue now to replenish inventory levels to where they need to be.","You're right, we did have strong volume growth in the second quarter. A lot of that was driven by our insecticide portfolio. And, yes, part of that was related to products that we're holding separate as part of the remedy to FMC. If I had to range that, I'd say that maybe of the overall segment total, about a quarter of that volume would have been tied to products that are in that hold-separate category. But the rest of it, and you're seeing that strength in Brazil as tied to our fungicides portfolio, we've talked about the Vessarya launch here for a few cycles. We started to really see that volume in the quarter as well, as it pulls through some additional picoxy volumes.","And then on top of that, I mentioned in the opening, we saw a return really to full volumes with Lannate and Vydate globally. And a lot of that goes in both North America and in Latin America. And then finally, Zorvec, we talked about its launch. Farmer results have been extraordinary, especially in places like China, where we're really enjoying some benefits of brand new technology, and that flows through in mix as well, and you saw that a little a bit in our pricing results for the segment, so.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. In the original design of the merger, there was no category for tax savings. Have you made any progress in tax design, or is your expectation that your tax savings are zero?","And secondly, in Protection Solutions, you've not really had the kind of operating improvement that you had in other divisions. Do you need to do something more, and what's holding you back there?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","So on tax, Jeff, this is Nick. Obviously, we're working that whole equation right now. We've had several discussions in Asia around \u2013 in Singapore, with tax authorities on what might be able to be put in place to the new merged entity. It's too soon to come out with what the end result of all those discussions are, but they're progressing very nicely as we go forward there. And so the tax \u2013 full tax impact \u2013 I'm not going to characterize what that impact is right now, but we've been working very hard around that area, and we've had some very good progress in that space.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Jeff, your, I think, second question there on DPS. We did have volume growth in the business, as you said, and didn't have quite the leverage on the operating earnings. But this past quarter, and by the way also the first quarter, we definitely made growth investments, mostly in Tyvek and Nomex, for new applications that we're launching.","One of them I mentioned in my prepared remarks a few minutes ago, so we see some nice opportunities in those areas and we're investing in them now for growth to pick up in the business. So we should, as we move forward, start to see leverage in that portfolio, but definitely making the investments for the future.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Hello, Jonas.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, wondering if you can give an update \u2013 what's left in the regulatory before we can close? And part of that, so the European Commission is reviewing the FMC, or the DuPont acquisition of the FMC assets. What happens if they come in and request a Phase 2 review, or even block it?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes, Jonas, so let me talk this through what's left. Understand that every jurisdiction around the world has approved the merger. So what is left, and Jonas, it goes right to your point. There's a couple markets where we're waiting on the approval of the buyer of the remedies and the two that are there is the EU, as you just mentioned on FMC, and the remedy in Brazil.","We're down to the, literally, the last yards here to punch the ball into the end zone. We're not going to a Phase 2. We're very deep into the dialogue and we're literally, kind of any day here, awaiting on those. So we will close the merger in August. I can't say for sure yet if it's the beginning or towards the end, but it will definitely happen here in the month of August.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Within E&C, it appears that you've had some pretty solid results across the segment, including consumer, semis, and photovoltaics. I think there were some easy comps in consumer versus the first half of 2016, but can you comment on your perceived sustainability of the rest of the growth across the E&C portfolio on a go-forward basis?","You mentioned that on top of the 180 basis points improvement that \u2013 on volumes and price \u2013 that you actually offset a little with gross spend. Can you just elaborate a little bit more there and how that factors into your outlook? Thank you.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah, let me handle that, Chris. So as you go forward looking at Electronics & Communications, as you said, you're absolutely right, there were some rather lower comps that we were against. So part of it is that. But we have seen good, strong consumer electronics, semiconductor, as well as PV in the quarter and as we're going forward. When I look beyond the second quarter in the rest of the year, we do expect continued moderate strength in some of these key markets, primarily the three that we talk about, consumer electronics, semiconductors and PV.","We are though forecasting growth rates to be down in the PV side due to some of the reduced government subsidies around the grid capacity constraints in China. So that will be tempered somewhat in the second half on the PV side but continued growth around the consumer electronics and semiconductor space.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Question for Jim. Wanted to ask you about your new dicamba formulation, FeXapan. I was wondering if you'd conducted your own growth chamber and field studies on this product to assess drift potential and volatilization or does this product essentially rely on Monsanto additives and approvals? Are you at all concerned that this product could go down the path of your former herbicide, Imprelis? And do you see any merits in combining Enlist and Xtend down the road as a means of providing this protection to the soybean crop?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. Clearly, you're right. We're watching this situation out there very closely. And DuPont FeXapan is essentially a duplicate product with XtendiMax that is out there in the marketplace. So we've relied heavily on the published labels that Monsanto had filed and duplicated those labels.","We did our own testing and our own field trials and, certainly, our customers have had visibility of this technology for a couple of years. And we're committed to a pretty \u2013 one of the highest stewardship approaches that we've taken. Our route-to-market gives us direct access to our grower customers.","We've been able to walk a lot of these fields. And based on the thousands of growers that are out there that have used this program this year successfully without any issues to meet the challenges that they face around some of these horribly resistant weeds that we're trying to control, we need this technology. And we're committed that it can be properly used and properly stewarded. So we're working with our customers. We're listening an awful lot. I've been out myself, looked at some fields, and we remain committed to the technology and the proper stewardship associated with it.","Operator","And our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You had significant charges related to cost-cutting. And given that the merger took much longer than expected to close, can you achieve the part of the $3 billion of cost-cutting ahead of the merger and how does the post-merger cost-cutting will look like? And then secondly, for Nick. Can you comment on the timing of your pension pre-funding, and any tax benefit you gain from that? Thank you.","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes, P.J., let me take the first part of that. We took some charges during the first half of this year that were related to our $3 billion program. But we're not going to see the benefits of those until we're into the merger. You probably saw a few months back, we made an announcement about shutting down one key facility, we're merging it into two other facilities.","We took a charge for that. And that has a longer tail to us, six to eight-month tail. So some of those programs we already enacted, so we don't have to it as long to get the synergy. But we still are lined up and ready to go on the $3 billion synergies once we merge and to get about 70% of that in the first 12 months of the merger.","A \u2013 [06ZC7N-E Nick Fanandakis]>: And P.J., on the pension. The contribution we made voluntary of $2.7 billion above what was required. A couple of drivers there. First, we look, P.J., at the next several years, the next three to five years of metrics and dynamics that impact the payments that would be required. And we had projected that the number of this $2.5 billion to $3 billion was about the number that we would have to pay over the next three to five years in the way of required contributions.","Second, we looked at the TVs, a little bit around that tax structures and what's coming in the way of tax changes. And if we're going to have to pay that over the next three to five years, it made sense to pay that now in order to get the benefit of the current tax position that we have.","And then lastly, and as I looked at the opportunity here and what we're able to do, by doing this contribution at this point in time, it enabled optionality and flexibility as we go towards the ultimate spins into the new entities by having that reduced unfunded pension to deal with. So those were the drivers, P.J. There was a tax benefit, it was anticipated and the flexibility piece.","Operator","And our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Jim, a question on soybeans, you talked about the price benefit of the ramp up of your Xtend and you're A-Series, but you did have high royalty cost. Did those higher royalties offset the price improvement? And how will those royalty expenses unfold as you go forward to the next two years and include more of those Monsanto technologies in your soybean lineup?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Don, for the question. You're right. We are able to realize a price premium for our Xtend soybeans. And it only represented this year, somewhere between 10% and 15% of our total lineup. You're also correct that the continued penetration of those Xtend soybeans thus, have a negative impact. We don't talk specifically about gross margins below kind of the corporate level, but you'll start to see that it will have a drag as we're not able to really fully price to cover 100% of that royalty.","Remember also, that royalty had some other things associated with it. It was our full enablement around Roundup Ready 2 Yield. It also had some other rights in access for us around the stacking of trade. So you can't pin 100% of that royalty drag directly on Xtend, but it is certainly a piece of that","As it unfolds over time, we are able to begin to cover that essentially 100% of that by the end of the planting horizon. And we do that in a number of ways. Other pricing mechanisms that we have in the marketplace for the value that those products delivering, like more of our A-Series lineup into that background germplasm.","It also has a flow through from a manufacturing perspective as we put more units to our manufacturing sites we get a pass-through on margin there as well. So as it becomes more and more a percentage of our overall lineup and our overall mix, I'm confident that we'll be able to essentially offset that.","Operator","And our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. The very last DuPont conference call. I don't know if I'm sad or excited or what. Hey, Ed, when you're talking about what's left to be done, you mentioned EU and you mentioned Brazil, and I thought I saw something about the South African Competition Tribunal is going to hold a hearing on August 4. Does that mean that August 1, 2 and 3 are off the table in terms of when you could close this transaction? How does that factor into the expected timing of the closure of the deal?","Edward D. Breen - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes. The South Africa one, we'll see, but we're in the daily talks with them. And I don't think that will be the long pole in the tent on the next week or so here. It's really the other two we talked about.","Operator","And our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, good morning. Question for Jim. You made a comment, but it wasn't quite clear to me. If you exclude the business it's going to go to FMC, roughly how would that change the 7% growth in the Ag business?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes, Duffy. If you think of it as an overall segment level Ag volumes, about half of the volume \u2013 about a quarter of the volume increase that we saw in the quarter would have been tied to those businesses that are moving away in the whole separate with the remedy. If I hone it down a little finer for you, and just talk specifically about the crop protection volume growth that we saw in the quarter, about half of that growth would be tied to that.","The other part of our growth is tied to products that we're really excited about going forward, that are actually on a growth trajectory. If you think about our fungicides portfolio, Zorvec and Vessarya, we're just starting to see those volumes, and they represented about a quarter of the benefit that we saw in the quarter.","And then the rest of it are insecticides that were not included in the remedy, and I mentioned Lannate and Vydate are two of the important ones, were now fully back enabled with volumes, and you're seeing the return to growth with those products as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about on Performance Materials, it was the one segment where you had some margin compression. Is that just a function of competitive intensity, is it the OEM customer bases product sell-through to and with the caution about still in play to draw in the second half, how do you expect that price cost dynamic to play out through the rest of the year? Thanks.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah, Bob, it's Nick. When you look at Performance Materials, you're right, it was the compression there, really driven by the raws, when you look at butadiene, benzyne, all have price increases. It also did have our plan turnaround at the cracker in the quarter as well. And that obviously would impact some of the volume pieces.","But mainly it's on the raws. Looking forward, we look to see those raw headwinds continue around butadiene, benzene, ethane. The ethylene margins are going to see compression because we are seeing ethylene spot pricing start to decline somewhat as well. So you will continue to see that margin compression in Performance Materials because of the market and the raws.","Operator","And our next question is from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you, good morning. You reiterated the $3 billion cost synergy target. I was curious if there's any updated thoughts regarding the $1 billion revenue synergy target? And whether the continued challenges we're seeing in the Ag commodity market in any way impact your long-term expectations?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","No, Sandy, this is Jim. We did a lot of work as we reset that $1 billion synergy target for the Ag businesses, post the remedies that we saw in the EU, and we had anticipated that there likely might be some remedy associated with the seed business in Latin America, which all came pretty much like we thought. So we feel good about that $1 billion. A lot of it is certainly tied to some areas around our production capabilities, seed and crop protection around the world, as we look at the opportunity to manage \u2013 to look at our footprint.","It has to go with market and some channel access. There are countries around the world where each company has maybe a better footprint and gives us opportunities to compare that. And then part of it has to do with our retail and market approaches. And the teams have spent a lot of time looking at this kind of multiproduct, multichannel, multibrand approach, and I feel really good about our ability and readiness to execute on those plans as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Hi, Jim. I guess just one last question on Ag, can you just flesh out a little bit your thoughts on your CRISPR strategy? Do you see that as deepening your portfolio in your existing footprint, or will you take a second look at crops or niche crops that you aren't currently in, or vegetables or any other applications?","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thanks, Laurence. Yes, our CRISPR strategy, I would say, is something that is still emerging. We've clearly identified a few early targets. We talked about our waxy corn program. I think I had mentioned it a little bit at several of the Ag conferences. So it will be our first commercial product. We'd expect that by the end of the decade. We're beginning to work on a few other diseases that we think CRISPR could help us control.","One of those is northern leaf blight. You know how important or how big an impact that disease can be. I think I saw a number last year, could have been as high as $1.6 billion in North America alone. So what that'll allow us to do is leverage our existing germplasm, but look for background germplasm where that trait or that natural disease resistance already exists and then use the CRISPR tool, just like we would any other advanced breeding technology, to breed our background germplasm in with that protection.","So, after we kind of get through those two constructs, we are going to take a look at other crops, whether this opens opportunities for wheat and rice that have been a little more difficult, and take a better look at the global background of our germplasm to see what other opportunities might bring.","Operator","Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just had a question. First off, you have pretty tough comps next year in Ag, potentially. So maybe you can just elaborate on how you see the contributions coming in from volume, price \u2013 volume may be facing some tough comps, so price maybe not so much, and then FX also should be easing. And then secondarily, does the pension contribution or potential capacity investments for Dow reduce the potential for buybacks or dividends post-merger close? Thanks.","James C. Collins - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yeah. It's obviously a little early to be talking about our guidance for next year. A clear part of our growth strategy as we think about the go-forward business is going to be on our new product pipeline, new product launches. I talked about a few here today. We have another important insecticide, Pyraxalt, which we'll be launching in 2018. And I think if you'll look at several of the Ag conference charts from both DuPont and Dow, you'll see that we both have good pipelines, with a number of new products coming over the next several years.","So 2018, we'll be continuing to accelerate the launches that we've already talked about with Zorvec, Vessarya. We'd hope to continue to penetrate with Xtend and Leptra, both in Latin America and North America, so there'll be a positive mix effect from those two as well. And then I mentioned Vessarya earlier.","I would say that, as we think about the second half of this year, especially in Brazil, we're cautious on that market, just as growers are. They're clearly watching to see how this North American crop develops. We're in a real critical stage right now, where temperature can have a big impact at pollination on yields. So I think we're all waiting to see how that turns out. That will naturally affect commodity prices for corn and soybeans. And those are two big drivers as to how the next season will unfold as well. So, as I said, it's a little early to call it, and we're watching things pretty closely.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Arun, on the second part of your question with the share buyback. Share buybacks is an important tool for returning value to the shareholders. It's one that both Dow and DuPont have utilized in the past. What's going to happen going forward, obviously, that's going to be a DowDuPont board decision as to what would take place in the way of share buybacks post-merger.","Specifically on your pension though, when you look about the pension contribution, keep in mind that from an adjusted net debt perspective and from a credit rating agency perspective, that really had zero impact because they take that pension liability into account in their rating. So by making that contribution, even though net debt went up, it had zero impact on the adjusted net debt.","Operator","Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. And Nick, I don't know if you'll be on the next call, but it's been great working with you.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Thank you, John. Same here.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","When you say you'll file pro forma historicals after the merger closes, when DowDuPont reports in October, will the July results of DuPont be disclosed at that time, or since this is structured as Dow acquiring DuPont, will that third quarter pro forma come out later?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes. So the pro formas will come out 75 days after the merger. And those pro formas that we will issue will have the historical DuPont in place. What you're talking about on the DowDuPont going forward, as you look at the merge day, the DowDuPont numbers will pick up from that point going forward.","So you could have anywhere from one to two months of DuPont alone results lost from those reported results depending upon when the close is, first of the month or the end of the month. That will not be picked up, but it would be picked up in the DuPont only pro formas.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Yefremov from Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Question on Performance Materials segment. Any of you, is it possible to meaningfully accelerate growth in engineered polymers through more active product line acquisitions?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well for Performance Materials, you're talking? I mean, if you look at Performance Materials and the work we're doing around application development, the continued driving of new applications, new uses, that's all still in place. So although there are market trends that determine pricing, we're constantly looking for applications that will allow us to grow at greater than the industry rates of growth.","So if you look at, for instance, auto builds over the last several quarters, you'll see a growth rate that the lower than that of which we've been able to realize in our business. So we'll continue to grow at a better rate because of the application development. As far as portfolio changes, that's something that the business always looks at the end looks for opportunities in and out to enhance of the value of the offering.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","And we'll take our last question.","Operator","And our last question is from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. In Performance Materials, the raw material outlook that you got for the second half, you've identified some changes in the pricing there. If we see some of the raw materials come down and price, can you just talk about what the potential is for some modest margin expansion that you see in those businesses?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Yes, obviously, if those raws don't go up as much or potentially turn, there's the opportunity to see margin expansion and greater leverage opportunity in the business. It's difficult to predict exactly where that's going to be. Keep in mind though, there is like a three-month lag to inventory as those movements take place either way.","Gregory R. Friedman - E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.","Well, thank you for joining us today on the DuPont second quarter earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] To listen to the webcast, please go to www.dupont.com. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you may begin your conference.","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay. Thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. With me today are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO.","The slides for today's call can be found on our website at dupont.com, along with the news release that was issued earlier today.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website.","As a reminder, our comments on today's call regarding segment earnings are on an underlying basis.","And finally, we've posted supplemental information on our website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. DuPont executed well in the quarter and delivered strong results despite macroeconomic headwinds. We continued our momentum with particularly robust volume growth in agriculture, food and enzyme markets. Company sales were up 7% despite a 3% currency headwind. Excluding currency, sales were up in all regions. Sales to developing markets grew 11% versus a very strong comp. While volumes were down in Europe and Asia, we continue to see sequential improvement on a seasonally adjusted basis. Volumes were up 5% and 3% in China and India, respectively, versus the second quarter of 2011, which is another measure of good momentum in the regions. Underlying earnings grew 8% to $1.48 per share.  On a segment level, pretax operating income was up 13% excluding Pharmaceuticals.","I'd like to highlight some of the important milestones from the quarter. First, we passed the one-year anniversary of the Danisco acquisition in May. The contributions and benefits from the acquisition have exceeded our expectation. We added 2 very attractive businesses to our portfolio and identified significant opportunities for cost and revenue synergies. This newly created reporting segments of Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences delivered strong performance this quarter and are expected to combine for over $4.5 billion in sales this year with a pretax operating margin in the 10% to 14% range. We will deliver $130 million of cost synergies by year end and expect additional productivity and margin expansion in 2013 and beyond.","Another important milestone in the quarter was the conclusion of the northern hemisphere planting season. For the first half, Ag segment results were up 15% and pretax operating income up 16% driven by new products, strong relationships with our growers and an ever-expanding global footprint. In addition to a strong foundation in North America, we have built solid businesses in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, which offer additional attractive growth.","Earlier this quarter, we announced government approval of the acquisition of Pannar Seed company, a leader in Africa, as yet another example of our global build-out.","Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight innovation milestones. We're tracking well versus our target of having 30% sales from new products introduced within the last 4 years. I'd like to give just one new product example from the quarter. Our performance polymers business responded quickly to address the global shortage of PA-12, a critical polymer for automotive applications. We accelerated the introduction of new grades of our Zytel product to allow the automotive industry to continue to produce parts with alternative materials. The contribution to business results is small in the quarter, but importantly, we demonstrated, again, DuPont to be a valued partner in helping the auto industry respond to a critical shortage.","Now I'll turn the call over to Nick and Karen to review the quarter in more detail. Then I'll come back and close out the call with our views on the outlook; so, Nick.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3.","Total segment PTOI on an underlying basis increased $185 million or 9%, overcoming headwinds relating to currency, a decrease in pharmaceutical income and higher pension costs. This outstanding performance demonstrates the diversity and strength of our portfolio, and moreover, the outstanding execution by our teams. Underlying earnings of $1.48 per share increased $0.11 compared to the $1.37 in the prior year as the strong operating results were partially offset by $0.06 of headwinds relating to exchange losses and taxes.","Consolidated net sales of $11 billion were up 7% versus the prior year. Local selling prices increased 6% with gains in all regions and most segments, reflecting the benefits from new product introductions coupled with our continued strong discipline to price per value. Portfolio changes, principally the Danisco acquisition, added 5% to sales.","Volume was down 1% from the near-peak level in the second quarter 2011. On a sequential basis, when you exclude Ag and adjust for seasonality, volumes improved 3% led by Asia-Pacific. We expect this momentum to continue as we head into the second half of the year, particularly in the photovoltaic, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets.","Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter, looking at EPS variance analysis on Slide 4. Higher local selling prices resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit. Variable costs were a $0.03 headwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were up about 1% over the prior year. Input costs have moderated from the first quarter. And for the full year, we now expect an increase of about 1% versus our previous assumption of 3%. The 2 percentage point improvement is primarily due to lower crude oil and ethane costs as well as more advantageous mixes of ores in our titanium dioxide business. The improvement also includes lower silver costs, which are passed through to the customer so there's no associated earnings impact. Excluding the impact of portfolio changes, volume declines resulted in an earnings hurt of $0.06 per share.","Let's move to fixed costs, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share when you exclude currency, volume and portfolio changes. This change reflects growth investments including increased R&D and marketing initiatives in the Ag segment and costs associated with operating the new Kevlar and Tedlar plans. I would also like to note that the fixed costs increase includes a $0.04 of higher noncash pension costs over prior year. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we've delivered approximately $190 million of fixed costs productivity year-to-date. We're well on our way toward exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year.","Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.06 variance in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect a $0.30 to $0.35 headwind for the full year, compared to our previous guidance of $0.20 to $0.25. For third quarter alone, the stronger dollar would result in about a $0.12 to $0.14 headwind versus prior year.","Next on the waterfall is portfolio changes, which is a net $0.06 benefit primarily reflecting the acquisition of Danisco.","Moving on. Exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.04 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed reconciliation on Schedule D in the earnings news release can be found. It shows the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings as well as the effective tax rate.","Income tax was a $0.02 headwind. This represents a difference between the base tax rates of 24.1% this quarter versus 23% last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions as well as the absence of the R&D and other tax credits, which expired at the end of 2011. We now expect full year 2012 base tax rate to be about 24%, 1 percentage point higher than our previous guidance, which equates to an additional $0.05 per share headwind for the full year. This revision reflects our latest view on the earnings mix.","Lastly, reduced pharmaceutical royalties were a $0.05 hurt. We are now estimating full year 2012 pharma pretax income to be approximately $65 million, an increase of $15 million versus our original guidance. With that change, we expect pharma to be $225 million less than it was in 2011.","There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5. You can see we delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 11% in the second quarter led by growth in Agriculture.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was $0.4 billion, essentially flat versus the prior year. At the end of the second quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2011, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by about 4% when you exclude the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year.","Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A\/A2 credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.","In April, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, and we paid our 431st consecutive quarterly dividend last month. Additionally, we completed the repurchase of $400 million of shares in the month of May.","In summary, for the second quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Global volume for the company declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, but improved sequentially excluding Agriculture. As a result of our strong execution and portfolio diversity, we delivered a double-digit increase in the underlying total segment PTOI excluding pharma in sight -- in spite of these very challenging market conditions that we're facing.","Turning now to the third quarter. We expect sequential volume growth to continue particularly in PV, consumer electronics and TiO2 markets. Additionally, we expect volume growth on a year-over-year basis, albeit off of a easier comp. Karen will provide more details when she covers the individual segments.","For the full year, there are several items that we see as either headwinds or tailwinds. Weaker macros, a stronger dollar and higher tax rate are some of the headwinds. On the other hand, lower import costs will certainly be a tailwind. Taking these items into consideration, we expect full year earnings to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share excluding significant items. Additionally, we expect earnings in the second half of the year to be split about evenly between quarters 3 and quarters 4.","Some of our businesses are impacted more from the changing macros than other businesses. However, each of our businesses has meaningful externally benchmarked performance targets. These businesses that are not executing against their targets are being required to provide even more productivity gains. These businesses are taking actions in a variety of ways including reducing expenditures and tightly managing their cash. They are also shifting resources as new opportunities are identified. All of our businesses are staying close to their customers to adapt to the changing demand signals and to continue to serve our customers' needs. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans.","Lastly, I would like to remind investors that although we are taking actions to react to today's dynamic market conditions; we also remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing the top line 7% and earnings 12%. We continue to drive a disciplined process around innovation, productivity and differential management. We're committed to build on successes in developing markets, and we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of continuing to have a strong balance sheet. Our focus on these areas and our strong execution are the key enablers to our success.","With that, let me turn the call over to Karen who will review the segments. Karen?","Karen A. Fletcher","Okay. Thanks, Nick. Turning to Slide 7. Our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first quarter, underpinned by strong northern hemisphere execution in a robust ag market. Sales of $3.4 billion grew 13% with roughly equal contributions from volume and price. Earnings grew 12% to $926 million. First half sales of $7.5 billion grew 15% with earnings up 16% to $2.2 billion.","Reviewing the individual businesses starting with seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.5 billion, up 12% with first half sales growing to $5.7 billion, up 16%. While first half growth reflects increased corn and soybean acres and strong price performance in North America, each region contributed positive price and volume growth. As a result, the business is expected to be at the top end of our goal to deliver 5% to 10% net price gains this year. North American growers have recognized the value of our Optimum AcreMax family of reduced and integrated refuge solutions. This is only the second commercial season for these technologies, and adoption rates continue to exceed our expectations. Over 70% of above- and below-ground sales and about 10% of above-ground-only sales were in AcreMax technology, which is at the high end of our expected range. Additionally, growers planted over 2 million acres of our Optimum AQUAmax hybrids developed to deliver a yield advantage in water-limited environments.","In soybeans, we grew sales through pricing gains and volume growth in North America. Our focus has been on optimizing the financial contribution of the breeding investment we made in soybeans. Through outstanding execution, we continue to lead the market based on the confidence customers have in our disease packages and all-around product performance.","Moving to Europe. Corn sales in the quarter were down year-over-year, as expected, following an early start to the season, which favored the first quarter. For the first half, pricing and volume contributed positively to sales growth.","In crop protection, second quarter sales grew to $879 million, up 15% with first half sales of $1.8 billion up 11% led by volume growth in North America and Latin America. The results reflect growth across all product categories with notable strength in insect control product sales as Rynaxypyr continues to penetrate markets around the world. The broad success of Rynaxypyr supports our aggressive investment effort to rapidly expand the franchise, bringing Cyazypyr products and Dermacor seed treatment to the market. We received our first registration of Cyazypyr in Argentina on July 13 and we expect to launch in the second half. We expect this franchise of insect control products derived from the same novel chemistry will grow to over $1 billion in the next few years.","Looking ahead to the second half for the Agriculture segment, our outlook remains unchanged as we expect high single-digit percentage sales growth and larger seasonal losses as compared to same period previous year. Second half sales anticipate strong business performance in both seeds and crop protection in Latin America, partially offset by significant currency headwinds primarily due to the rial and lower corn planting as growers in Argentina and Brazil are expected to move strongly to soybean.","Sales growth is offset by continued investment in our Right Product, Right Acre strategy; new product launches; and long-term R&D build-out.","Moving to Slide 8 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $795 million were down 11%, primarily due to soft photovoltaic volume and lower silver price pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in photovoltaic materials was enhanced by our industry-leading products like our latest Solamet paste gaining traction with customers, coupled with recovery from the inventory correction that began late last year.","In consumer electronics, demand was up for our market-leading materials, driven by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. PTOI was down 27% on lower volume and plant utilization. Additionally in the prior year, PTOI was reduced $20 million due to extreme metal volatility.","For third quarter, we expect sales down slightly due to pass-through of lower metal prices and PTOI up slightly on higher volume. Sequentially, the story is even stronger with earnings up substantially due to continued momentum in PV and consumer electronics. Photovoltaics remain a very dynamic market. We see installations continuing strong in the U.S. and China with new positive feed-in tariffs in Japan even as industry macros are weighing on the module makers.","For the full year, we reaffirm our view of 10% growth in global installs, and our advanced materials will play an essential part in that.  On the consumer electronics side, launches of new mobile devices are expected to pull through our industry-leading materials like Kapton Black.","Now on to slide 9, Industrial Biosciences. We delivered sales of $300 million with growth predominantly from acquisitions. In biomaterials, our Sorona polymer continues to gain market adoption in carpets, thanks to our highly differentiated value proposition. PTOI of $44 million grew primarily because of acquisition but also from cost synergies, which are performing in line with expectations.","Turning to third quarter. We see sales up modestly and PTOI up substantially with realization of additional cost synergies. As in previous quarters, the generally good market fundamentals for enzymes are expected to remain favorable, albeit with some slowing of enzymes for ethanol given higher corn prices.","Turning now to Slide 10 for Nutrition & Health. The teams delivered a very strong performance in the quarter, posting sales of $885 million with earnings of $112 million. The quarter reflects the 2-month acquisition benefit in addition to growth in Solae. Our global teams have maintained the business momentum from these -- from our businesses, delivering pro forma sales growth in health and protection and enablers with both price and volume gains that more than offset currency headwinds.","For Solae, a key growth objective is to enhance product mix and earnings by growing the Solae specialty segment while optimizing the commodity segment. Towards that goal, Solae specialty posted mid teens sales growth as our new products continue to penetrate the nutrition solutions and improved health segment of the food ingredients market. Pretax operating margins of 13% reflect the progress we're making on cost synergies with meaningful impact from timing lag on raw material cost inflation.","Moving to the outlook for third quarter. We expect moderate sales growth with substantial earnings growth. Year-over-year pretax operating margins will be up substantially, reflecting business mix and cost synergies, but will be tempered sequentially due to raw material inflation.","Moving to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales were essentially flat as higher prices offset lower volume. Versus a sold-out environment last year, TiO2 demand was down particularly in Europe and to a lesser extent, Asia, while North America showed strength. Within the quarter, we saw growing momentum particularly in Asia. As an example, China's June sales were our strongest year-to-date for TiO2. Strong demand in industrial chemicals like cyanide also provided an uplift to the quarter's result. PTOI of $538 million was up 7% despite higher ore costs, reflecting our technologically advantaged process and consistent gains in productivity.","In third quarter, we expect sales down modestly and PTOI down substantially versus a very strong comp of tight TiO2 and robust fluoroproducts demand a year ago. In spite of the uncertain global macro environment, segment outlook is for sequential improvement. Additionally, we reiterate our view of flat segment margins year-over-year for Performance Chemicals on slightly lower volume.","Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Higher OEM volume, tied to a 10% increase in auto builds, helped the quarter. These increases were more than offset by weaker refinish and powder coatings volumes primarily in Europe, resulting from weak macro conditions. PTOI increased 26% with 180 basis point margin expansion, which resulted from pricing and mix enrichment actions plus productivity gains, partially offset by unfavorable currency.","For the third quarter, we expect segment sales to be essentially flat in spite of unfavorable currency. PTOI is expected to be up substantially with continued margin expansion versus prior year.","Now turning to Performance Materials on Slide 13. Automotive-related demand continued to improve, particularly in North America. This was offset by continued softness in industrial and electronics markets, especially in Europe and Asia-Pacific. However, we did see sequential growth in electronics in Asia. Additionally, packaging markets improved modestly. PTOI increased 25% primarily due to lower feedstock costs, higher volume, improved mix partially offset by unfavorable currency.","For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down modestly as stronger volume will be offset by lower U.S. dollar selling prices, primarily due to currency headwind. PTOI is expected to be up substantially on a stronger mix.","On Slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales decreased 4%, primarily due to lower public sector demand and continued softness in industrial markets. PTOI was down 11% on weaker mix, unfavorable currency and higher costs associated with operating the new Kevlar plant, partially offset by value-based pricing actions.","For the third quarter, sales are expected to be up slightly with higher demand, principally in North America and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by unfavorable currency. We see demand improvement for Kevlar as some of our newer products, utilizing the latest technology installed in our new Cooper River plant, are being very well received in the market. Additionally, we expect sequential demand improvement from Nomex from higher infrastructure spend and Tyvek in worker protection markets. PTOI is expected to be up modestly on stronger volume and improved fixed cost leverage, partially offset by unfavorable currency.","That concludes our review of the segments. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Ellen.","Ellen J. Kullman","Great. Thank you, Karen. As Nick already stated, we expect full year earnings, excluding significant items, to be toward the lower end of our existing range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share due to the uncertainties of the global macro conditions, currency and anticipated higher tax rate due to earnings mix. Year-to-date, you've seen the strength and resiliency of our portfolio plus disciplined execution combine for earnings that were better than expected, and we intend to finish the year with the same discipline and focus. We remain committed to differentially managing our portfolio and invest in markets where growth remains attractive. Our innovation centers are an important tool in this effort and they\u2019re places where we can focus resource and leverage the power of DuPont innovation in order to pursue growth opportunities in developing markets.","As the result of a series of very purposeful actions, investment innovation, selective capacity expansion, acquisitions such as Danisco and Pannar, just to name a few, our portfolio is less cyclical than it was just 5 years ago, and we continue to drive productivity and benefit from the restructuring actions we implemented in 2009.","Our business teams remain close to the markets and customers, ensuring that they are ready -- reading underlying demand signals from downstream markets and able to meet whatever changing customer needs they see. They're also focusing on innovation that truly add value to our customers and create opportunity for growth in new areas.","Now I'd like to walk through some of the markets that are the most important to DuPont. Our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments will contribute about 1\/3 of the company's sales and earnings this year. Agriculture and specialty food ingredient markets are expanding based on population growth and the demand for healthier food choices. Our businesses drive solutions to improve productivity and deliver more nutritious food. Success is contingent on our ability to continue to deliver products with improved performance for our customers year in and year out. And we have tremendous momentum with how customers have responded to our latest offering.","TiO2, it's received a lot of attention lately. The market became soft in the second half of '11 and we've seen slow sequential recovery since then. We believe that recent comments in the press regarding demand outlook overstated the softness of the market, so much so in fact that we publicly affirmed our confidence in the demand outlook. We expect sequential recovery to continue. We expect segment margin for 2012 to be comparable to 2011, which is among the highest in our portfolio right now. Keep in mind that overall fundamentals in this market are robust. Demands historically track GDP growth, and we anticipate only modest capacity additions to this market over the next 4 years. We expect favorable market conditions to remain during that timeframe.","Moving to automotive. Our expectation of global builds is still about 5% growth this year, although that outlook varies from a 6% decline in Europe to 14% growth in North America with the rest of the world somewhere in between.","And finally, electronic markets are improving. Consumer electronics is bolstered by continued strong demand for smartphones and tablets. Demand for photovoltaic materials has shown good sequential improvement since the downturn in the second half of 2011, and we continue to expect PV installations to be up 10% over last year. Overall, with DuPont's mix of products sold into electronic markets, we expect sequential recovery to continue in the second half.","So to summarize, second quarter came in about as expected against the backdrop of very dynamic market conditions. The company demonstrated strong execution and resiliency. The comments we've made about our performance and our outlook are very consistent with what we've been saying for the past couple of years: Innovation is the backbone of the company and we differentiate ourselves through our offerings. We are prioritizing resources and aligning with secular growth opportunities in food, energy and protection and productivity. It remains a way of life for each and every of our businesses. These are our constants, the essential drivers of our performance that enable us to deliver increased value for our shareholders over time.","So now, we can open up the lines for your questions.","Karen A. Fletcher","Great. Thank you. John, let's open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Have you come to a decision as to whether you'll sell Performance Coatings or not?","Ellen J. Kullman","Jeff, I'm not sure where that question is coming from. Certainly, Performance Coatings, as you saw, had good performance this year. But as you know, we evaluate our portfolio each and every quarter and if we have anything to announce about any of our businesses or product lines, we'll make sure we include you on the call.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then as my follow-up, were titanium dioxide prices up sequentially in the second quarter and do you expect them to be up sequentially in the third quarter?","Ellen J. Kullman","Nick, why don't you take that?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes, why don't I take that? When you look at the TiO2 pricing in the second quarter, it was flattish versus being up. And expectation is that it's going to be flattish as you continue for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Your Asian volumes were off 1% in the quarter. Do you see volumes there stabilizing? When I look at it in the context of minus 2 last quarter and minus 10 in the fourth quarter, you called out improvement in China and India. I'm wondering if you think Asia may have bottomed here.","Ellen J. Kullman","Kevin, thanks for the question. Asia is still a tale of 2 cities when you think about the developing areas versus the developed areas. Although our volume was down 1% in the quarter; in the developing Asia, it was up about 3% with -- developing Asia was up 3% with developed Asia down 4%. And you felt, China and Hong Kong, I mentioned in my remarks, were up 5% and then India was up 3%. And if you look at it sequentially, I mean it's been a hard one to call this year because it just was moving all over the place coming off of the Chinese New Year. But we have seen -- continue to see sequential improvement and as we take a look at the underlying markets, we expect that to continue.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, Ellen, you mentioned that June was the strongest month for TiO2 in China. I think in the past, you've talked about pigment as being a leading indicator. And so my question is to what extent does that activity in June in China reflect restocking given some price declines in the region? Or rather would you attribute it to an increase in underlying demand there?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think it's a hard one to call because you got to kind of look at it over time, but we see both happening. I mean we see that there's movement in some restocking. And I think that the Chinese government has really tried to create and have done some stimulus like just in the last month or so, they've had 2 cuts in their benchmark blending rate. They put in consumption incentives for some consumer goods and they've been working to accelerate project approvals on infrastructure. And we see all that is starting to move that market and I think TiO2 is a beneficiary of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Sabina Chatterjee in for Frank Mitsch. Just -- I'll continue on the topic of TiO2. Obviously, DuPont's been a lot more confident than its peers in your outlook. Can you just give us maybe some metrics to support that view? You just spoke about Asia, but maybe utilization rates and inventory levels here in the U.S. and even globally, if you could?.","Ellen J. Kullman","Nick, why don't you...","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes, why don't I take that one? And so when you -- let me -- let's talk about the larger picture of where we are with the TiO2 business. The fundamentals really haven't changed here. We're still very bullish on the mid-, long-term prospects for TiO2. When you look at the growth that it has, relation to GDP, over the next 5 years the only significant new capacity being announced is DuPont. And there just isn't enough capacity announced to keep up with the demand at that sort of GDP growth rate. So we're seeing the basic fundamentals still intact moving forward even if there is a short-term period of demand contraction. We're also seeing our strong position based on the decades of innovation that we have, our #1 position around production capacity as well as our advantage position from a manufacturing technology standpoint. You couple all those macros with some of the specifics that are going on right now. When you look at -- even with this volume being somewhat depressed, you look at the earnings of this business in the year and you look at the margins of this business and you're still in line with what was performance was in last year's results. So you're seeing margins very much in line and earnings, overall, very much in line. So I think the overall macro picture is still very positive and strong in the TiO2 business.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe then as a follow up, switching gears to photovoltaic. It sounds today that you might be a little more constructive than you've been maybe in recent weeks. So have module inventories been worked down? And is it reasonable to say that maybe the H2 recovery has unfolded a little better than you expected earlier?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think that the module inventories continue to be worked off with the installs. The first half installs were at a 10% rate, so they're -- this isn't a back-end loaded from an install standpoint. So that's really helped. As we look at our value chain, we predicted an improving position quarter-by-quarter and we think that still holds. So we think that the dynamics that we laid out for you in the last earnings call are playing out just as we have predicted.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","On the seed production side, can you give us a sense for availability of seed next year given the kind of adverse growing conditions here in North America? And I guess, more particularly, about how much of Pioneer's seed production is irrigated?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, thanks. We know everybody's concerned based on the weather and the drought that's going on. We're looking at good availability for the 2013 series -- season. We have very strong risk management practices not only in -- for that carryover seed, but even our production locations are very geographically diverse, which helps, with 2\/3 being irrigated. So that actually is very helpful especially with the weather. And then we always have winter production capability that we can come into play to fill in. So we are working that through as you speak, and we think we're going to have great availability for 2013 the season.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, outstanding. And then with the recent ethanol plant rationalization, so -- or expected rationalization, does that make any sort of meaningful impact on the Industrial Biosciences division?","Ellen J. Kullman","No, I think that commodity prices are going to come and go. And with the Renewable Fuel Standard, there's kind of a base that is there in that marketplace. We're still looking at cellulosic ethanol ultimately as being the answer and making great headways on that one. But as we said and Karen said in her comments, we think the enzymes sales in that market will come off a little bit based on commodity prices. We still believe that, that market will continue to progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","As we look at your consolidated sales, how much of the local market price is being driven by raw materials and tight markets versus new product introductions?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, Nick?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes. I think a rough rule of thumb you can use when you look at our pricing in the marketplace, about 2\/3 or 75% is driven through the innovation. And a small percentage is driven -- in that 25% range is driven by pass-throughs of raws up or down.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-through. What kind of macro or micro conditions does DuPont need to see to get Safety & Protection to actually hit its PTOI targets?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, I think we see that there are some things that are working in their favor, so sequentially we think that continues -- that will continue to improve. First of all, the acceptance of the new materials out of the Cooper River line, we're seeing great progress there. And even you\u2019ve seen progress in the quarter -- second quarter, with the margin expansion you've seen in the second quarter, which is commensurate with improved products and improved utilization of those. Asia, we see is improving sequentially. North America continues to be solid. Europe is a challenge there. But even construction is given a little bit of a boost with residential being up 21%, now commercial is on its back but we're more heavily in residential than not. So there are some of those fundamentals that are coming into play that show an improving picture. But we're going to make sure that regardless of the external environment, we're going to be driving through either innovation and productivity to get to those targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on seeds. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about pricing going into next year? And I guess I'm just trying to be sensitive to the potential that you mentioned in the release that there were some higher seed production costs this year. Presumably, you passed those through and you would do the same if there was anything incremental next year, but it just might impact the mathematical margin you generate. So if you could just comment on that, that'd be helpful.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, obviously with the commodity -- with volatile commodity prices, that continues to be looked at. Net farm income remains high, is high and is expected to remain high, so that's a positive, and probably will remain high for a little while because the stocks are not where -- it looks like with the volumes that are expected to come through from this season, stocks are supposed to remain high -- or stocks are supposed to remain low, therefore commodity price is high. We -- it's really early to talk about the details, but we are consistent with our pricing philosophy to the value of the new products, and I think you've seen that this year. I think you've seen that this year with our pricing being up at the high end of the range that we've talked about, 5% to 10%. I think you've seen it with the penetration of our new products. And it really is Optimum AcreMax now, for next year Optimum AcreMax XTreme and they're going to continue to make progress. AQUAmax, the new water resist -- water-tolerant, -- or drought-tolerant product -- I'll get the words right, yet. We're seeing great performance there in the 2 million acres there. So we tend to focus on product and performance to really drive our strategy with our pricing in North America. So I mean we're positive on price, but we'll bring up these new details as the year progresses.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, given that you're going to have greater penetration and mix from new products again next year plus the higher seed costs, should we be -- is it, just back of the envelope, reasonable to assume that pricing was in the high end of the 5% to 10% this year, might be higher than that next year or is it too early to tell?","Ellen J. Kullman","We're not going to go there yet. There's a lot that has to play out this year before we'll put that out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ellen, can you comment on final U.S. corn and soybean market share numbers?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, David. I mean so we've had great performance in North America. The denominator's changed on us. The USDA added about, I don't know, 1 million acres to the number last month. And so with that, I think with our -- the numbers that we're looking at, I'd say we feel we've held share of those crops, say, after multiple years of share gains. I mean if you think about it between 2008 and 2012, we gained about 6 points in corn and more than 10 points in soy. So with the change in denominator, I'm going to back off a little bit and say we held share. But ultimately, we'll see where it ends up.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Nick, just on TiO2 pricing per buyers and per some consultants who are seeing prices move lower in Asia, lower in Europe and there are reports that prices have been lower in the U.S. as we speak, are you expecting U.S. prices not to be down from current levels, or do you see some erosion over the next few months here?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Well, in aggregate, David, I see pricing being flattish as we close out the year. And as I say, I think that's reflected not only in the margins that we've shown year-to-date, but also in our projections for the rest of the year. When we look at the total year, we're saying that our margin for the segment is going to be about equal to last year, which was about 25% PTOI margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First question on the Ag business. Every year, there's bit of a kerfuffle when the yield data comes out. This is an unusual year with the amount of drought concerns. Do you expect -- can you give us some sense of what you think -- how you think people should be thinking about either the performance of your treated products in drought conditions or the newer hybrids versus the older hybrids. Were you breeding hybrids for drought tolerance, or is there some disconnects that will show up in the data that shouldn't be read through to a more normalized year?","Ellen J. Kullman","So if you think about it, we launched AQUAmax and we have it on 2 million acres. The anecdotes I'm getting back from talking to farmers and talking to Paul Schickler, I was up here with them 2 weeks ago, are that it\u2019s performing well and it's still green in some very stressed environments and AQUAmax is a native trait. And I think this year with the -- as we share the performance of that, we're going to get a lot more interest in that product in this coming season. But I think that's where we have to go as an industry. We have to go to be to be able to breed and to have traits that are very resilient under a wide range of environmental conditions, and I think that's the focus for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question on Ag. We came into this planting season expecting a tremendous year. When you look at the inventory channels, a lot of people were building inventory, expecting a lot of input. Now with the drought, my guess is farmers would back off on the amount of inputs being pesticides they'd use in the back half of the year. Is there a chance that we end up with too much inventory in the system on the ag chem side in North America, in particular, and that could be a little bit of a headwind in the back half of the year?","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, so crop protection chemicals is really a regional story. And so while there may be some backing off on what's required based on the conditions in North America, it's raining in Latin America. And we see the season shaping up there to be probably a pretty strong one for crop protection chemicals. And I think the 2 when you add it all up, it'll be a fine year for the business.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then on Nick's comment when you were talking about some of the costs for your inputs going from 3%, your old expectations, to 1%, I think you mentioned TiO2 ore. Is that just the fact that your operating rates are running a little bit below where you would have expected, so you don't have to buy that very expensive kind of marginal ton of ore and so your mix is better on that side?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes, essentially that's it, Duffy. As you know, we have the unique capability of consuming both the low and the high grade and still producing the high-grade TiO2. And it's a matter of how we regulate that mix of high grade and low grade, which is ability to impact that pricing just as you recapped.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On the TiO2 front, given what seems to be at least a little bit of slackening in demand, is there any thought as to the timing of your ramp-up on the big Mexico expansion on the brownfield and maybe delaying that out at all?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","I mean when I look at the overall market conditions and the GDP growth that it has shown over extended periods of time, it tells me that even with our planned expansions over this 5-year period, it's going to be tight market conditions, and there won't be the ability when you look 3, 4 years out.","Ellen J. Kullman","Yes, and you couple that when it would come online, it is 3 to 4 years out. And so far then, GDP will do what it does.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough; and then just one other question on the pension side of things. There was a recent change in Congress in terms of pension funding. Given the size of your pension, can you walk us through kind of what the implications could be for DuPont? I think it probably -- it should, if it starts to impact things, hit in 2013 for you in terms of cash flows.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Yes. So you're all, you\u2019re well aware of the pension change, the ability to aggregate it over a 25-year period for a discount. And then of course, that deals with the cash contribution piece. It doesn't deal with the GAAP accounting or the balance sheet item on it. And so what we're talking about here is this change in law will appreciably reduce the cash funding requirements that DuPont would have to make, specifically in that next 2-year period, that '13, '14 sort of time period. When you look at the impact, it's about a percentage point in discount rate change -- increase in discount rate, which will have that sort of rather large impact around future funding requirements.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit -- in your TiO2 business, we see it with the chem solutions and fluoropolymers and chemicals, so it's a little bit tough to look at your particular margins. But I'm sure you benchmark against your competition. I'm just curious has your competitive margin or advantage expanded as we've seen ore prices go up, and can you give us some order of magnitude?","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Well, I think when you look at our margins, and we don't talk about individual businesses. We keep it at the segment level. We do see, as I mentioned, the margins staying about equal to last year. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to get into specifics around my margin as it relates to others in the industry. I think you'd understand that.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you just give a little more detail on what's happening in fluoroproducts that causes the profit pressure in the second half?","Ellen J. Kullman","They had very strong comps in 2011. They were really -- they were sold out last year and fluoroproducts solutions into wide variety of market like wire and cable and places like that. So those volumes have come off a little bit, and that's really basically the change.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Could you update us on where you are in your review of the Performance Coatings segment?","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, Performance Coatings, you saw, had a good quarter. They had good margin expansion with the productivity programs coming through. They benefited from stronger volumes and OEMs, but coming off a little bit in the other segment. So they had some mix and opportunities there as well. So they continue to make progress on their goals of retaining their margin that we've laid out for you guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, just a question on the overall guidance. Ellen, what would have to happen to hit the upper end of your guidance? And it seems like you don't think there's much of a probability of that, so I'm just wondering why you wouldn't adjust your guidance downwards?.","Ellen J. Kullman","Well, I\u2019ll let Nick give you details. Let me give you the high-level. Don, we're seeing sequential improvement in many markets that have been very sketchy in the first half of the year. And that gives us -- and our ability to forecast out is not as great as we used to think it was back in the last decade. So we see some positive momentum from the sequential numbers in several of our businesses. We have the positive momentum of raws and then offset by tax and currency. But Nick, I don't know if you want to comment any more than that. I guess I've covered it for him now.","Nicholas C. Fanandakis","Well, yes, you covered the main variables here. I mean, as Ellen mentioned, when the headwinds, you talk about the weaker macro conditions, the stronger dollar, the higher tax rate, those are the types of things that are impacting us in a negative way. But on the flip side, on the tailwind side, we do have the lower import costs. And as Ellen mentioned, the sequential improvement, some of our key markets and regions, for example, we talked about China, specifically, and the increases that are occurring in there on a sequential basis. I think you got to look at the overall breadth and strength of our portfolio. And we see opportunities where we can implement growth contingency plans and\/or additional productivity gains in our businesses or regions that can compensate for where there are weaker outlooks elsewhere and we still have 5 to 6 months ahead of us to deliver on against the commitments. And taking all this into consideration, we now believe and expect our earnings to be towards the lower end of the existing range.","Karen A. Fletcher","So I know we're coming up on 10:00. We've got a couple of our peers who have calls at 10. I'm sorry to cut off your questioning, but this will bring our call to an end. Thanks for your continued interest in DuPont, and we'll be talking with you later.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl, you may begin.","Carl Lukach","","Good morning everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Performance Conference Call. Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President, responsible for our Agriculture and Nutrition and Health segments.","The slides for today\u2019s presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our Web site along with our news release. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and I direct you to Slide 2 for our disclaimers.","All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today\u2019s slides posted on our Web site.","For today\u2019s agenda, Nick will review our second quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. I will provide a brief business segment highlights and Jim will provide insights into agriculture markets. We will conclude with Ellen\u2019s comments followed by your questions.","With that introduction, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick. Nick?","Nick Fanandakis","","Thank you, Carl. Turning now to Slide 3, we have the highlights for our second quarter. The quarter played out about as we expected in our June 26 preannouncement with operating earnings per share of $1.17, 9% lower than the prior year.","Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 4. I\u2019ll cover the results for our reporting segments. We entered the second quarter with solid momentum in our industrial facing business and delivered strong earnings growth in many segments. We did however experience lower operating earnings in our agricultural segment primarily due to lower volume in corn seeds. Jim will talk about this in greater detail in a few minutes.","We delivered exceptional quarterly results in our nutrition and health, safety and protection and industrial bioscience segments. Volume gains and margin improvement across these businesses delivered substantial operating earnings improvements and each of these segments improved their operating earnings margins 300 to 400 basis points in the quarter.","In our performance materials segment sales were up in our performance polymers business reflecting strength in auto markets. However this did not overcome the expected lower revenues in packing and industrial polymers due primarily to the planned made and shutdown at our Orange Texas ethylene unit. This six year turnaround went mostly as planned and the unit is now operating at capacity. The duration of the scheduled outage was 58 days nearly two-thirds of the quarter.","In performance chemicals lower prices for refrigerants resulted in lower segment operating earnings in the quarter. And in agriculture the earnings were lower due to lower corn seed volumes impacted by shifts in plantings area and higher seed inventory right downs versus the prior year. Year-on-year variance in currency rates had a negligible impact in our segment results for this quarter. We therefore are revising our previous estimate of $0.08 per share headwind for the year to about $0.04.","Turning now to Slide 5, from a regional perspective developing Asia volumes were up 8% led by China where most businesses realized volume improvements during the quarter. The volume increases were partially offset by currency and price. Developed EMEA benefited from solid demand in autos, construction and the favorable currency. Sales declines in the U.S. and Canada and developing EMEA were driven by the lower ag results. Additionally, the Orange Texas ethylene shutdown for performance materials negatively impacted sales in the U.S. and Canada as expected. Sales in Latin America declined reflecting weaker industrial production compared to the prior year.","Turning now to Slide 6, I will cover some additional variances in our operating earnings per share. You see that the largest variance on this slide is from exchange gains and losses or EG&L attributable to our currency hedging program. Through this program we aim to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net monitory assets around the world from the effects of short-term swings in currency rates. Normally the program costs us about $0.03 per share per quarter. In the second quarter of 2014 however we experienced increased currency rate volatility and higher cost principally in emerging markets. In addition, we had currency devaluation in the Ukraine which along with the cost of the program drove our actual net result to a $54 million loss. By comparison, in the second quarter of last year we had several favorable currency settlements and other adjustments that resulted in an EG&L net gain of $19 million. Year-over-year we swung from a $19 million net gain to a $54 million net loss hence the $0.08 negative variance you see on the slide.","Turning to Slide 7, our free cash flow for the first half of 2014 compared to 2013 has improved by about $600 million. This is due primarily to the absence of tax payments related to the sale of performance coatings which occurred in the first half of 2013. Consistent with prior years we anticipate strong seasonal cash flow in the fourth quarter. Net debt at June 30th reflects our normal seasonal flow and is up slightly from the prior year.","As we indicated in April we started an ASR program in the first quarter and completed it in the second quarter, coupled with open market share purchases we have retired nearly 17 million shares in total this year. As of June 30th we are more than half way towards our commitment to repurchase $2 billion in shares during 2014 and we intend to complete the remainder in the second half of the year.","As we\u2019ve said share repurchases are one way to return value to our shareholders and we use them to complement our strong dividends. As we noted in our release this morning our Board authorized a $0.02 or 4% increase in our quarterly dividend to be paid to common shareholders of record on August 15, 2014 in September of 2014. As a result the third quarter dividend will be $0.47 per share. This is the third dividend increase in 27 months. In total we have returned nearly $12 billion to our shareholders since 2009 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Moving now to Slide 8, I will just reiterate that our redesign initiatives are underway and we will begin to deliver benefits this year, Ellen will go into more details on these initiatives. Additionally as we said in late June we\u2019re still on-track for our performance chemical separation in mid-2015 and our plan to moving ahead there. We currently expect to file SEC Form-10 in December of this year.","Today we\u2019re reaffirming our updated full year operating earnings per share outlook of $4 to $4.10 per share. We anticipate a strong second half based on continued growth in global industrial demand resulting in operating earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.35 while the seasonal cut offs in our ag business are sometimes difficult to size between the third and fourth quarter. We currently anticipate about 40% of our second half earnings will incur in the third quarter.","On that note let me turn it over Carl. Carl?","Carl Lukach","I\u2019d now like to provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder our slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the investor center Web site under Events & Presentations along with the other materials for today\u2019s call. Nutrition and health on Slide 9 recorded a strong second quarter building on momentum established in the third quarter of 2013.","Sales were 7% higher primarily due to broad-based volume growth aided by improved product mix. We saw a strong recovery in enablers and sustained momentum for probiotics and cultures. Volumes grew in all regions and we continue to grow in emerging markets. Operating earnings of 105 million, increased 72% from higher sales, lower raw material costs, productivity gains and the absence of one-time costs in the prior year. Operating margins for the quarter improved by over 400 basis points. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement.","In the third quarter, we expect modest sales growth with continued broad-based volume gains. Operating earnings are expected to be significantly higher due to increased sales, mix enrichment and continuing productivity actions. We will continue to make strategic investments in research, application development and customer facing resources to drive future growth. Operating margins are expected to continue the trend of year-over-year improvement.","In industrial biosciences on Slide 10 we continue to deliver strong results. Operating earnings of 59 million were up 37% primarily driven by mix enrichment, improved margins associated with new products and volumes in biorefineries and bioactives. Favorable ethanol industry fundamentals are driving increased enzyme demand as ethanol margins are attractive and production is near capacity. Enzyme volumes in the graying ethanol market are also being driven by the rollout of DuPont\u2019s total performance system TPS, using novel enzymes and other functional bio-products designed to increase custom earnings through increased production rates, yield and efficiency.","Since introduction in late 2013 TPS has been adopted across a diverse set of ethanol production plants and further adoptions of our plant. We are implementing TPS as our standard offering for the industry with next-generation versions already in preparation for launch. Bioactive sales in the quarter were also higher on strong demand for Axtra PHY in animal nutrition markets and strong enzyme demand. For the third quarter, we expect modest sales growth aided by continued enzyme demand for ethanol production and stronger sales of Sorona polymer.","Third quarter operating earnings are expected to be up substantially driven primarily by higher volumes and improved margins. For the first half segment operating earnings were up 37% and operating margins were up 440 basis points from the prior year.","When we created the nutrition and health and industrial biosciences segments through the Danisco acquisition we envisioned future top-line growth coupled with cost productivity and we are delivering. The research and development and capital investments we made following the acquisition in key enzyme spaces and in probiotics capacity are yielding dividends now and we have additional growth runway in front of us.","In safety and protection on Slide 11 sales were up 1% on higher volumes in industrial markets improved Nomex and Kevlar demand was partially offset by lower revenues from Clean Technologies offerings as fewer sulfuric acid recovery plants were built. Kevlar demand growth was driven by increased sales into law enforcement, transportation and wire and cable sectors while Nomex demand improved in energy solutions and thermal industrial applications. Regionally sales volume growth was most notable in Europe and Asia Pacific partially offset by lower prices.","Second quarter operating earnings increased 22% and operating earnings margins increased over 300 basis points. Segment operating earnings are benefiting from improved margins, increased demand from industrial markets and continued benefits from cost productivity initiatives coupled with improved plant operating results. For the third quarter, we anticipate segment operating earnings will be up about 20% driven by higher margins and sustained operational productivity.","In electronics and compunctions on slide 12, sales were essentially flat excluding the impact of lower metal price pass through. Volume growth in most product lines led by gains in consumer electronics was offset by lower price due to metals, product mix and competitive pressures. Operating earnings declined 6 million as volume growth and productivity gains were more than offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED licensing income realized during the second quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of last year\u2019s licensing income operating earnings increased 19%.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we continue to expect global photovoltaic module installations to be up for the year with mid-teen growth rates. We expect a strong second half in photovoltaics driven by installations in China and good demand for our products in consumer electronics markets. Third quarter sales are expected to be slightly higher with operating earnings slightly lower due to a decrease in other income.","In performance materials on Slide 13 we had another solid quarter. Volume for engineering polymers grew 6% fueled by strong automotive demand in China, Europe and North America. Sales of our high performance engineered parts were up 10% due to improved demand in electronics, oil and gas and aerospace, and in consumer, construction, and food packaging markets our specialty resins volumes were stable.","As expected sales and earnings were below last year due to our scheduled ethylene outage and the sale of GLS\/Vinyls, but the fundamentals driving our sustained business results remained intact. Operationally, we are well positioned for a strong second half following the successful restart of our ethylene unit. In the third quarter, we anticipate sales revenue will be essentially flat versus the prior year as continued volume growth in performance polymers is offset by the impact of portfolio changes. Despite a prior year $30 million benefit from a joint venture, we expect operating earnings will still be up modestly due to improved demand and strong execution.","In performance chemicals on Slide 14, segment sales were down 8% due to a portfolio change and lower prices. Slightly higher Ti02 volumes were more than offset by lower volumes in Chemicals and Fluoroproducts. Second quarter refrigerant prices for mobile and stationary applications were lower than expected and Ti02 prices were flat sequentially, but down about 3% on a year-over-year basis. In refrigerants, demand for Opteon YF our new low GWP refrigerant for mobile air conditioning continues to grow. In 2014, we anticipate sales will double to reach approximately $100 million as automotive OEMs increase their rate of adoption of this new product.","In Ti02, volumes were up slightly from the prior year, marking six consecutive quarters of year-over-year volume growth. We believe our customer inventories are normal and producer levels remain essentially unchanged. For the third quarter, we expect performance chemicals\u2019 operating earnings will be up moderately on improved volumes and margins.","In Agriculture on Slide 15, second quarter results finished in-line with the update we provided in late June. Supply-driven impacts on commodity prices led to reductions in corn planted area in the North America and Brazil Safrinha seasons. Second quarter sales were essentially flat as higher seed prices and higher insecticide and soybean seed volumes were offset by lower corn seed and herbicide volumes. Operating earnings for the quarter were 11% lower as higher seed prices and lower seed input costs were more than offset by lower overall volumes and higher seed inventory write-downs.","As we turn to the second half, we expect sales to be modestly higher with operating earnings substantially higher for the Agriculture segment. Rynaxypyr is expected to continue to drive growth in insect control aided by new launches of Cyazypyr and Lumigen seed treatments, including Dermacor for use on soybeans in Brazil.","In seeds, we expect lower corn sales in Brazil\u2019s summer season as growers continue to shift hectares from corn to soybeans. Corn seed price in Brazil is expected to be modestly lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance to the Herculex 1 trait. Herculex combined with leading Pioneer germplasm continues to offer control of a broad spectrum of pests. We also expect early seed shipments for the 2015 Brazil Safrinha and northern hemisphere seasons to be similar to the prior year.","While the cutoff between third quarter and fourth quarter sales comes at an important time in the Latin America season, we expect the third quarter to result in a similar loss to last year followed by a stronger fourth quarter. In addition, the third quarter comparison will be impacted by the absence of a $26 million equity re-measurement gain from the acquisition of Pannar which was recorded in the prior year.","That concludes our segment commentary. Now, I will turn the call over to Jim who will add additional perspective on Agriculture. Jim?","Jim Borel","Thanks, Carl. This morning I would like to provide some perspective on the environment we\u2019re currently seeing in Agriculture and our expectations for the future. We understand the importance of timely communication with investors and continue to improve our forecasting as we navigate today\u2019s dynamic agricultural markets. Today, agriculture globally is in a period of transition following recent supply driven peaks and crop commodity prices and planted area following the droughts of 2011 and 2012. As stocks have begun to rebuild, we have seen prices decline for key commodities like corn, soybeans, and wheat.","On the demand side, we see encouraging signs as ethanol and livestock demand are recovering after declines driven by high feedstock cost. Our total planted area in the U.S. and globally remained near historical peaks. We are currently experiencing a shift in crop choice form corn to soybeans. This shift began last summer in Latin America and continued through Brazil\u2019s second season and this spring\u2019s planting season in the Northern Hemisphere as global corn supplies have been rebuilt more quickly than in soybeans. And we expect this bias towards soybeans to continue in Latin America this summer.","At the same time we're transitioning our soybean seed product line in North America over the next few years as we introduce new T Series genetics and varieties containing the Roundup Ready 2 trait and we are building an emerging soybean business in Brazil. This contributed to lower seed sales in our agriculture segment in 2014 as additional soybean volumes did not fully reflect the shift in acres. While the robust environment the past few years has been supportive of our growth our seed and crop protection businesses have also executed well.","From 2008 to 2013 we grew sales in our agriculture segment 12% on average per year well above our long-term trend line growth target and higher than the competition. During that timeframe we grew North America corn share by about 7 points and soybean share by about 10 points. Launched several innovative new technologies including Rynaxypyr, AQUAmax and AcreMax and grew in key growth markets including Brazil, Eastern Europe, India and China.","We improved operating margins by about 600 basis points while making investments in R&D, supply chain and our go-to-market strategy. And we continue to sharpen our investment focus. These past and future investments position us well for continued growth. Despite the normal year-to-year abs and flows in grain ending stocks planted area and local product performance. Our ability to continue to innovate will be the force that drives our growth over the long-term, our pipeline in agriculture it as strong as I\u2019ve seen it in my 36 years at DuPont. ","We have continued our growth in crop protection in the first half of this year and have additional run way for Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr, Penthiopyrad and Picoxystrobin across a broad range of crops and markets. And we are extending the application of these technologies with Lumigen seed treatments. In the second quarter, we recorded our first sales of Dermacor bringing growers in Brazil an important new seed treatment tool to manage resistance and control insects in soybeans.","In corn seed we are expanding our current AQUAmax and insect control offerings in North America and expect to launch DP4114 within the next few years pending regulatory approvals. I\u2019m also pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in decision services, our newest service Encirca yield nitrogen management is now available to growers across the U.S. expanding on a successful pilot program.","In 2015 we expect to launch Optimum Leptra and introductory volumes in Brazil pending regulatory approvals. Leptra will offer three modes of action to help farmers manage a broad spectrum of insects. And we continue to develop in advance new high yielding genetics around the world. As we make the product transition in soybeans the pioneer brand remains the leading soybean brand in North America I\u2019m pleased by what I see in customer deals this summer and in our pipeline with T Series genetics and new varieties with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait.","As we begin to look forward to the 2015 and 2016 seasons we\u2019re keeping a close eye on agricultural markets, the USDA estimate corn yield will be a new record and as we near the end of the key pollination period for corn the crop overall is in good health. Another strong harvest in North America if realized will continue pressure overall economics for corn and soybean farmers. We\u2019re closely watching the development of the corn and soybean crops and the impact on commodity prices planted area, cropping intentions and grower sentiment.","If the current supply dynamics persist and corn planted area remains under pressure it will temper short-term growth rates for the agricultural segment particularly in our seed business. However I\u2019m confident the fundamentals for a long-term sustainable demand growth remained intact, influenced by trends in population, rising incomes and desire for improved diet.","We remain committed to continued investment in agriculture and also confident in the competitiveness of our seed and crop protection businesses and in our ability to achieve our long-term sales growth and operating margin targets in agriculture.","Now let me turn it over to Ellen for her closing thoughts.","Ellen Kullman","","Great, thank you Jim and good morning everyone. Nick, Carl and Jim highlighted our segment quarterly performance so let me focus on our key second half and long-term strategic objective which are central to the significant transition we\u2019re driving to become the next generation DuPont, a company with a focused and robust portfolio centered on high potential commercial opportunities where DuPont science and technology can create step change solutions and deliver significant value to customers and shareholders.","As you know we have been solidly on this path since 2009 and we\u2019ve been taking large steps forward to transform DuPont. We sold our coatings business last year and improved several non-strategic businesses from our portfolio all in line with our plan to create a higher value company for shareholders. Last October we also announced our decision to separate our performance chemicals segment multiple work streams are completing the significant work to establish legal entities around the word to carve out financials and to develop and install standalone IT systems.","Most importantly we\u2019re finalizing the right organizational and leadership teams to ensure we maintain and build upon the premier global positions we have developed in both Titanium Dioxide and Chemicals and Fluoroproducts markets. Overall, we remain on schedule for a mid-2015 separation which will create two industry-leading companies with distinct value creation strategies. For DuPont the separation is a catalyst that will further unlock the value of our strategy to build and strengthen world-leading positions in Agriculture and Nutrition, Bio-Based Industrial and Advanced Materials by further leveraging our integrated science capability on a simplified leaner operating model.","Less than four weeks ago, we also highlighted the broad related redesign of the Company\u2019s operating structure. This work will align our operating models with the Company\u2019s more focused post in portfolio and deliver significant improvements in the way we work yielding better return on invested capital, speed and decision making, improved service to customers to name a few of the planned outcomes.","Businesses are leveraging this work stream to drive changes that improve their competitiveness as well. This reset of the operating model is a central plank of our transformation ensuring that the DuPont of 2015 and beyond deliver further growth and value with a simplified streamline support structure and a smaller cost base.","There is no doubt that following the performance chemicals separation, DuPont will be a different company in many ways and we\u2019re taking the key steps forward now to be ready. We have transitioned from the planning phase to the execution phase of our redesign and now expect to deliver initial benefits starting in the second half of this year. As I have said previously we believe that as we implement these changes, we will identify further savings opportunities and we expect to incur future charges under this initiative.","As a reminder, the redesign scope we have defined to-date is expected to generate savings in core DuPont from about $625 million and we forecasted elimination of an additional $375 million of cost to be realized at the time of the performance chemicals separation in mid-2015. In total, we expect to achieve about two-thirds of the billion dollar annual savings on a run rate basis by the end of 2015 with the remainder by 2019 all from a 2013 base line.","It\u2019s important to note that this program is distinct and separate from past productivity initiatives. Our current redesign initiative is broader than just our global supply chain. It\u2019s centered on optimizing our corporate business and asset infrastructure. But the redesign certainly includes removing residual costs associated with the separation of performance chemicals. The scope is far more expensive. All business segments and functions are included. For example, we\u2019ve identified opportunities to streamline our asset base in multiple segments without reducing our capacity to meet end used demand.","We are taking advantage of opportunities to consolidate production capacity into fewer sites which really is the pillars to maintain our service and growth capability while reducing costs. We are realigning and rationalizing staffing in many corporate functions to take advantage of centering opportunities that create greater leverage while enhancing productivity. In our manufacturing operations, we\u2019re focused on reducing plant overheads and fixed cost to enhance our competiveness throughout our global footprint. These are just some of the steps we\u2019re implementing in the redesign to generation savings and enhance our productivity. Bottom-line, we will be a stronger, more agile, growth enabled company as a result of this initiative.","We are capturing value from Danisco and continuing to look for more acquisition opportunities aligned with our strategic priorities. As we look ahead to the separation of our performance chemicals segment and an impact on our balance sheet, we are actively engaged in evaluating acquisition ideas that would augment our organic growth plans. These programs in concert with sound execution plans make me confident to deliver on our second half commitments in the short-term and position DuPont for higher growth in the long-term. We will reduce complexity and improve our speed and agility as we advance our strategy and become the new DuPont. A higher growth, higher value company that brings the strength of our science to bear on some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.","Carl Lukach","Okay, thank you, Ellen. Let\u2019s now open up the lines to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. (Operator Instructions) In the interest of time management requests that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question and please pickup your handset to allow optimal sound quality. If you have additional questions you may reenter the queue. And our first question is from John Roberts from UBS.","Nick Fanandakis","","Hello John.","John Roberts - UBS","Can you hear me?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, hi John.","John Roberts - UBS","Thanks. Ellen, you had an investor last week suggest that DuPont needs to simplify further and you are already taking a good cut at it here separating technology-intensive from non What other dimensions can we think about simplification on?","Ellen Kullman","","I think john we\u2019ve taken a tremendous step, a very large step towards the new DuPont with the separation of the coatings business the separation of the performance chemicals business. And then with that really taking a look at all aspect of the support to our businesses our line is our businesses that how we create value both top-line and bottom-line all the rest of us are here from a government standpoint with management or to support them so the operating model really hasn\u2019t been recast in a while. And so we\u2019re basically questioning and understanding every part of it and how it supports the company that DuPont will be post spin and so it\u2019s simplification of decision making it is clarity on those rights and accountability and it\u2019s all to drive top-line growth the innovation pipeline that time delivering the marketplace. I mean we\u2019ve made a lot of steps in the individual business you see the performance in a nation IB and S&P and I think it\u2019s a continuation on that. So we're very much driving that direction I\u2019m really excited about how the organization is stepping up and see this as a real opportunity and I think that you all be pleased with the results that come from that.","John Roberts - UBS","And then as a follow-up, Nick, during the quarter, you got asked a question at a conference about the potential for a Reverse Morris Trust for Performance Chemicals. It seems actually clearly on the path for a straight spin here, but I didn't know if you wanted to clarify your earlier response?","Nick Fanandakis","","Well I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll stay with my earlier response we are on the path for a spin which is what I said we\u2019re continuing down that path, we\u2019ve always said that we would, if there was value creation greater than the spend path that we are on that we would explore any of those other value creation opportunities but the path we are on is a spin right now.","John Roberts - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Thanks very much. There were a lot of good commentary on 3Q on your expectations, but I just would like a little more clarification on why 4Q is going to be up so much year over year. I see you have big expectations in Agriculture for Cyazypyr and Dermacor, but what are the other drivers in 4Q that we should make sure we have modeled right?","Ellen Kullman","Well first why don\u2019t Jim what don\u2019t you touch on the ag second half and you\u2019re viewing that and reconsidering on the other businesses.","Jim Borel","Okay. First of all fourth quarter has continue to become more profitable overtime based on the growth of our crop protection business in Latin America particularly and then also the seeds businesses globally. Our growth in second half in ag is going to be led by crop protection you mention Cyazypyr and Dermacor in Brazil those are exciting. Last year\u2019s insect business was strong benefited by heavy infestations of Helicoverpa we\u2019re positioned well with supply as the market have similar outbreaks this year. So crop protection is set for a strong second half.","We\u2019re expecting lower seed volumes in Brazil summer season based on an expectation of lower planted area and as we have mentioned before modestly lower seeds pricing based on the fall armyworm resistance that we\u2019re seeing. We're expecting fourth quarter seed shipments for the 2015 Brazil safrinha and Northern Hemisphere seasons to be similar to last year. So all of that combined is what gives us confidence around a strong second half.","Ellen Kullman","Yes and I think if you look across the company continued improvement in industrial production across global market automotive demand remains strong led by China and North America that certainly helps our performance polymers business, PV is also are growing and it looks like they\u2019re going to come-in in mid-teens supporting our Electronics & Communication growth the momentum we\u2019ve seen from industrial biosciences nutrition and health is continuing and as we enter the second half those segments are going to continue to perform there. And remember the first half results were impacted by the ethylene shutdown, low refrigerant prices, things like that that will not factored in the second half and then Fresh Start is going to add all the redesign is going to add some opportunity because while I see cost start coming out through the third and into the fourth. So when you put all that together that\u2019s why we have the outlooks that we talked about for the third and fourth quarter.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And just as a follow-up on the ag piece, the Cyazypyr and Dermacor in 4Q, is that sort of a normal level of demand or is there some type of channel trade loading that is going to take place there?","Jim Borel","That\u2019s a normal in a both launches, so they\u2019re really just entering the market so most of that will be used in season as it is moving out. The Dermacor, we expect to be put on seeds. It will get planted in the season that we\u2019re going into. Cyazypyr, we\u2019d expect to be used because the season extends into the early part of the next year and I don\u2019t know if every out it will be used in the fourth quarter, but yes it\u2019s for an active season.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Jim, I want to go back to some of your comments on ag because I know corn seed is about half of the segment sales and also corn is an important end market for Crop Protection as well. So as you noted, as growers shift to soy in reaction to lower corn prices, what are the implications for Pioneer seed volumes and pricing growth next year and overall growth in ag earnings, which you mentioned will be below trend? And are there any offsetting margin benefits? Clearly, you will be paying growers a lot less this year to produce seed that you will be selling next year?","Jim Borel","Yes thanks, Don. First of all, it\u2019s too early to I think to try to predict or give guidance for next year as you know there are a lot of different variables that you mentioned a few of them. Certainly, if current market environment persists shift in acres towards soybeans, that can temper volume in the short-term in the seed business. But as you mentioned, we\u2019ll get the benefit of lower input costs or cost of goods. Crop Protection continues to have strong growth trends. Corn is one market but to be honest much bigger business in specialty crops around the world. But that\u2019s all if that persists, so it\u2019s probably important to remember that we\u2019re coming off a really strong crop last year and what looks like it could be a strong crop this year, but the crop isn\u2019t harvested yet. And now you go back two years, we were coming off a couple of years of drought and record high prices, so these things can change pretty marketed. So I think we need to get a little farther down the roads and see what this crop really ends to be before we\u2019re going to have more visibility around the outlook for next year.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","And just to follow-up on soya, since you don't have as much RR2 as the rest of the market, did you lose share this year and are you at risk of losing share as growers do shift to soy next year?","Jim Borel","It\u2019s too early to try to predict or comment on share based on, let\u2019s see where final acres come out and let the dust settle as we normally do. But that said, as we talked about we\u2019re in a transition both of introducing the T series and the Round of 2 and that, that will take the next couple of years to get that in place. So, it\u2019s too early to comment on share but we feel very confident about our overall competitiveness in soya and expect that overtime we\u2019ll reestablish the strong leadership position that we\u2019ve had. We are still the largest -- Pioneer is still the largest soybean brand in North America.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, good morning. Jim, with corn commodity futures well below $4 a bushel, would you comment on what impact, if any, you would expect that to have on prospective corn seed pricing in North America? Or put differently, is there a level below which you think prices would be impacted?","Jim Borel","Good question. A couple of things to remember, first of all as we have talked overtime, we price for value and as we come out with new hybrids and new trade combinations that deliver more yield and more value to the farmer even 375 a bushel, that\u2019s still -- if you can give them extra bushels that\u2019s still more value. So there is still this pricing opportunities for innovation even at the prices being lower than they have been over the last several years. The other thing to remember is we\u2019ve got a lot of new technologies that we\u2019ve launched over the last few years that still working its way into our lineup. So a fair bid of the price that we\u2019re expecting to get in \u201915 is going to from mix as the penetration of that those products go into the portfolio. So there are couple of reasons why we\u2019re -- we\u2019re still confident that there is pricing opportunities that will realize next year.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","As a follow-up if I may on a different subject. Slide 5 indicates that your sales in developed EMEA increased 5% while developing EMEA declined 5%. Kind of a counterintuitive disparity there, I was wondering if you could explain why that might be the case or some of the key drivers?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, certainly, currency was a positive factor in developed Europe. I think it was about 4%. Performance polymers, things like that had double flow, double digits sales increases. Crop Protection, protection technologies kind of mid-teens growth, and N&H and IB both had higher single growth, so we had good growth in developed Europe. Ag outside of crop was a drag on that. Ukraine certainly had an impact there. But there was a difference between positive currency impact in developed Europe and negative currency impact in developing Europe that created some of that dichotomy there.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs ","","Thank you. Good morning.","Ellen Kullman","Good morning Bob.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","","Ellen I'm curious on the PC spin. Obviously, the refrigerants and Ti02 businesses aren't as robust as they might become in future periods. Is there any flexibility around your timing there to maybe defer or delay that to get a bigger profit number so you might be able to apply a little bit more debt and bring more cash back to the parent company?","Ellen Kullman","Obviously that something that we continue to watch and understand but Nick wants to talk about the aspects of that.","Nick Fanandakis ","","So Bob when you look at that obviously it\u2019s impossible to time anything exactly at the pick so you go through the spin we're pushing and driving for closure in the mid 2015 time period. When we go through the decisions on the debt structure and the debt load in the dividend load things a lot of that is going to determine based on the projections as well where the entities are going to be going so will be downing that into the thinking around that low that\u2019s put on those entities and then obviously as the value then is created in the market as they continue to come back out of the cycle that they\u2019re stabilized in right now the shareholders get the benefit of that value as those increases occur.","Ellen Kullman","And let me tell you modeling and pay doesn\u2019t show a big dislocation between what the original comp values were and where we are today, we continue to look at it. But we do believe that we can get this done mid next year it is the time line I think it\u2019s going to be better for both companies going forward.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs ","","And can you update us on the 200,000 expansion at Altamira, when that might come on and if that could be an appreciable benefit to your margin?","Ellen Kullman","","Time line on that is end of 2015 for start up and we are talking late 2015 fourth quarter.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs ","","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Yes, hi, good morning. Jim, a question for you, in Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, this year, you have a limited launch with only 13 new hybrids. How quickly can you ramp up there and what is happening to Roundup Ready 1 seed pricing in the meantime?","Jim Borel","First of all the ramp up based on performance what we\u2019re seeing in framers field this summer look good that\u2019s going to be driven based on that we have strongly performing Roundup varieties already out there, it will take a few years as it rolls through as we continue to ramp up.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","And a question for Ellen, overall, your top line was flat in the quarter and the top line is growing maybe only 2% or 3% the last 2.5 years. So was the redesign driven by slower top line growth that you need cost cutting in order to improve earnings?","Ellen Kullman","Yes so, obviously you\u2019ve seen improvement in our top-line in several other segments ag certainly is lot have been discussing it\u2019s not going to be a little lower growth in the previous performance. If you take a look at the productivity that we continue to drive if there two enable operating leverage and hence gives us the ability to make sure that we\u2019re returning appropriately to our shareholder I mean in the timeframe where externals are changing you just got to use every labor you have, it\u2019s an opportunity to reset the model it\u2019s an opportunity to start in a very thoughtful way in terms of how do you create that top-line momentum I\u2019m very happy with the pipelines we have if you look at ag and both pioneer and crop protection, if you look at protection technology, if you look at nutrition I mean I\u2019m really happy with the pipelines we have I think we\u2019re starting to see results of lot of these efforts and when continue to understand that we\u2019re on the transformation path to create a higher growth higher value company and I think we're making a lot of progress here I mean the merchant markets and what we're seeing time for penetration. So we continue to drive all aspects of the business in order to create value.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","","Next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. ","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank ","","Thank you, good morning. Ellen, on the redesign, you mentioned you've identified further opportunities for savings. How should we think about that in terms of timing and the amount? Will that be during or after the current plan and could it be as large as the current plan?","Ellen Kullman","I don\u2019t think it will so it\u2019s hard to know what they think when I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know right Dave I mean so we continue to, every month we continue to make progress every month as we understand what our opportunities are we\u2019re not waiting because as we roll this out we\u2019re learning and understanding things and we\u2019re let just say intersections are that need to be stream line and driving them. So you might here hopefully by the end of the year and we have an update on it I\u2019m hopeful that it will be larger than what we\u2019re seeing today but I\u2019m not going to be shy it\u2019s going to be obviously north of $1 billion and we\u2019re going to go after it very rigorously in a disciplined process. So I don\u2019t want to kind of conjunct about what it could be. I am going to bring it out to you as we understand it and let you understand how it\u2019s going to create real value for DuPont.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Understood and just on Performance Materials, could you size again the size -- the impact of the ethylene outage? Was it roughly $50 million? And also what is the underlying growth of this business, your view over the next two to three years on a top-line volume basis?","Ellen Kullman","The outage itself which was 58 days in length, it was sort of on the longer side than what we expected so that did impact the top line by a few percent in the second quarter. Obviously, we were preferred for it so that we could keep our firm customers going through that. Size ballpark it\u2019s about what you had said. I think that\u2019s going forward though, what I am seeing is driving growth from an application development standpoint and driving it from the standpoint of new product, new applications emerging markets. You\u2019ve seen how well the Performance Polymers business is doing in automotive in the Europe and Asia. Food and other packaging is going well, we are in the midst of a transition there and I think that we continue to see this -- the top-line target we have for that segment is 3% to 5% and I think that\u2019s eminently achievable.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. My first question is for Nick. In 2014, is working capital changes net going to be a use of funds or a source of funds and by how much, if you can tell?","Nick Fanandakis","Earlier on we said that cash flow from operations was going to be returning to the more normalized levels and we were projecting around $3 billion. Jeff, we\u2019re still on track to be in that same ballpark right around that $3 billion mark from a cash flow from operations. The key variable there is obviously going to be within the ag business and the yearend collections there and the market conditions that would allow for what extend to that yearend collection would be versus payments, deferred payments later.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Alright. And then my second question is for Ellen. Agricultural volumes are obviously lower than one would have expected and if corn yields continue to be relatively good, volumes will probably be again lower than one would have expected next year. If that does turn out to be the case, do you think that your capital expenditures for Agriculture, as you've planned them, will decrease in any material way and do you think that you might take a look at the agricultural cost structure in order to make it more efficient under those demand conditions?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, I think if you take a look at the restructuring charge that we announced in the second quarter, you will see an ag component on that, so obviously we comprehended the trend and are taking steps, not going to wait on it. Any kind of distribution of capital, we rigorously scrub based on market conditions and productivity. I am very proud of the team at Pioneer and what they have done from a productivity standpoint to get more out of their existing assets. I think the investments that we made in Latin America are servicing us very well and I think regardless of what\u2019s happening there now, I am hopeful we will still like the Ukrainian assets overtime. It continues to be an important part of the world from an agricultural standpoint. So these are decisions that we make based on the opportunity and the reality of the marketplace. Jim I don\u2019t know what you want to add to that.","Jim Borel","I think that\u2019s a good summary. The key thing also is the long-term fundamentals under the market and the long-term potential of the businesses in ag. Crop Protection is continuing to perform well and so the volume question of seed is one component, over the next years, unknown around where acres would go, but the big picture is still for a lot of growth.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking my question. With regard to the M&A outlook, can you give us your thoughts, Ellen, as to how we should be thinking about the pipeline, whether it is a target-rich environment? And then also given that you are in the process of getting out of the Performance Chems business, do you see on ability to make acquisitions while that is still kind of in the work in process or is it something realistically it would muddy the water too much and you'd rather just get out of that business first before really kind of initiating any major M&A?","Ellen Kullman","Yes, so our M&A process continues, right. We are continuing to look in Ag and Nutrition, Industrial Biosciences and Advanced Material where there is commercial logic, where there is strategic rationale. Does it align with our priorities, our growth and what does it enable. You have often heard me talked about the fact that acquisitions have to create momentum, not bulk and add to that science portfolio and\/or the penetration portfolio for instance in emergent market. It takes awhile for any deal to get completed. These aren\u2019t things that happened quickly. So we haven\u2019t stopped our activity there. I thing we could take a midsized one and integrated today I mean sign, pay is integrated today I think it would be very tough for us but I think as we come into the spring we\u2019re going to have that opportunity so that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to look and understand where there could be real value created.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","","Great. And then just a quick question with regard to the cost-cutting program. Are there specific business segments that should see a larger benefit and maybe bigger margin lift as we think about modeling them out over the next year or two?","Ellen Kullman","","No, I think it\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019re going to see since a lot of it is in to support functions to the businesses that you\u2019re going to see which is going to be pretty across the board. There is going to be specific actions that we\u2019ve asked the businesses to consider. The 8K which is out today depicts the restructuring by segments so that will help you. But for instance consolidation of production and hence creating lower cost in higher operating margin is something we\u2019re constantly looking and doing. So I think you can see what the 8K says from the standpoint of the corporation or the corporate cost that\u2019s pretty much across the board.","Carl Lukach","","John I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","","Frank Mitch from Wells Fargo.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo Securities","","Love the way you save the best for last, thank you so much. Also, Carl, wanted to thank you, a very informative call. You forced me to Google GWP, so I now know what that stands for. So thank you for that as well?","Ellen Kullman","With that we\u2019re making a smarter plan.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo Securities","Absolutely, absolutely. A couple of follow-ups. Just coming back to the European question, the dichotomy between Western and Eastern, what percent is ag of your Western European business and what percent of your Eastern European business is ag roughly?","Ellen Kullman","","Okay, now you are taxing my -- let's see, Nick, can you come up with that pretty quickly I think it\u2019s higher obviously ag is much higher in Eastern Europe than Western Europe because there is not much of industrial base there. But we\u2019ll have the IR team connect with you and see if they can get you more information there Frank.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo Securities","Alright, great. I thought that that probably was the case and was part of it. And Jim, while we have you, Crop Protection obviously seems to be doing well, new products, etc. How should we think about the one to three-year growth rate for the Crop Protection side of the house? And I guess lastly, precision ag has been generating a lot of press. Where does DuPont stand in that area? What can we expect from DuPont in that area over the next couple years?","Jim Borel","","First of all on the crop protection side we are expecting continued growth there they have been growing a point or two ahead of the market over the last number of years we expect that continue based on the new products and the expanded market. So growth will continue based on that in crop protection. In terms of the services and Encirca is we\u2019re really pleased with launch so far where we\u2019ve been an industry leader in many ways around decision services for the last 10 plus years in terms of mapping deals for the 12 million harvest acres map 8 million as planted but the launch of it there is a new brand and Encirca is going well.","We've had a very positive grower response to Encirca View and Encirca Premium, which is in partnership with DTN. There is over 1000 weather stations in our proprietary network with new collaborations with I guess eight land-grant universities. We talked about a goal earlier of 500,000 seed based variable rate seeding prescriptions and we excided that and as we mentioned today we\u2019ve launched the Encirca Yield Nitrogen management module now in July so that\u2019s out there. So good farmer acceptance, good success so far everything is going very well.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Ellen Kullman","Thanks Frank. I just want to take an opportunity to close the call by thanking you offer your questions and reiterating our IR team is ready if any additional questions for those of you who might have not been able to get in the queue.","I hope from this call you understand that for the short term we\u2019re well positioned for strong second half and for the long-term we are actively and successfully creating value DuPont shareholders and that\u2019s we deliver disciplined program that\u2019s making the portfolio stronger and more focused and driving our readiness to compete as a new DuPont in 2015 and beyond.","On the pick and separation effort and the redesign of the operating model are two more large steps forward. We have a clear focused plan in placed in our actively executing to get these priorities and we look forward to talking to you again in three months with our third quarter results. So thank you all.","Operator","","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect at this time."],"8179":["E.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.","Greg Friedman","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 performance. Joining me are Ed Breen, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Collins, Executive Vice President responsible for our Agriculture segment.","The slides for today\u2019s presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and I direct you to slide one for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.","Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review our reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today\u2019s slides, which are posted on our website.","For today\u2019s agenda, Ed will provide opening remarks; Nick will review our fourth quarter financial performance; and Ed will provide concluding remarks followed by your questions. With that introduction it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Breen","Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. We entered 2016 with a lot of momentum on key initiatives. I\u2019d like to comment on the quarter and our progress operationally before having Nick go through the numbers; then I\u2019ll come back and provide an update on our planned merger with the Dow.","The quarter came in largely as expected amid continued challenging macroeconomic conditions including currency pressures. The progress we are making on the three critical initiatives, I outlined last quarter, contributed to the quarter and will serve us well in the future, regardless of macro conditions, our cost structure; our working capital; and our capital spending.","First on our cost structure: Cost reductions contributed $0.10 per share to our fourth quarter results, providing $0.40 in savings for the full year from our operational redesign program. We also announced in December a new global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce 2016 costs by $700 million versus 2015 or $900 million on a run rate basis. We have since identified an additional $100 million savings bringing our run rate total to $1 billion and increasing our 2016 savings to about $730 million. This plan will further simplify our organization into fewer larger businesses with integrated R&D, engineering, and manufacturing functions, accelerate decision making, and connect even more closely to our end markets. It will sharpen our focus by giving the businesses more control over their P&Ls and more agility to pursue growth. When we complete our cost savings program, our SG&A will reduce by about 15% on a run rate basis in 2016. Within that number, we are reducing our corporate costs by $200 million. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percentage of sales will reduce to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.","I want to emphasize that this program is a DuPont initiative, completely separate from the proposed merger with Dow. We took a clean slate approach to building a right organization for the future. The changes we are making would have occurred regardless of the planned merger. The changes will make our businesses linear, stronger competitors in every market where we do business. Importantly, these efforts are bringing even greater discipline and rigor to the investments we continue to make in the businesses to maintain our competitive advantage and better connect our science to the marketplace.","The long-term success of our businesses will be driven by innovation and strong return on R&D investments. Our pipeline continues to deliver. Over the past quarter in Agriculture, we successfully launched Leptra corn hybrids for the Safrinha season. Production plans for Leptra are on track for one of the fastest technology rampups in Pioneer history in the summer season. Our two newest classes of genetics demonstrated strong harvest performance and are expected to comprise over half of our North America corn sales volume in 2016.","Qrome corn products continue to progress well towards commercialization. We will expand testing this coming summer in our IMPACT trials, as we await final import approvals in key markets.","Another example of where R&D is driving productive innovation is in Nutrition & Health. In the quarter, we had saw volume growth in high value products including probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems. Demand for probiotics primarily in the U.S. has been provided by our HOWARU products which promote respiratory health in children. Demand for cultures has been driven by YO-MIX which facilitates sugar reduction and delivers mouth feel and texture in yogurt.","Next on our list of critical initiatives is working capital. Each of our businesses has set individual goals for improvement in working capital for 2016 from a bottoms-up approach. We also launched the company-wide project on working capital to look at it from the top-down perspective. We are benchmarking our performance in payables, receivables and inventory against industry leaders and believe the opportunity for improvement is significant, as much as 1 billion in the medium-term.","Our third area of focus is capital allocation. Our capital spending is guided by long-term goals and that principle will not change. After looking hard at every project and its expected returns, we approved 2016 capital expenditures of $1.1 billion that is down from about $1.4 billion in 2015 and $1.5 billion in previous years excluding Chemours. Our 2016 plan is more in line with our depreciation and amortization.","In summary, all of these activities demonstrate our focus on strengthening DuPont while creating sustainable shareholder value.","Now, I\u2019d like to ask Nick to take us to through the financials and outlook in more detail.","Nick Fanandakis","Thank you, Ed. Let\u2019s start with the details of the fourth quarter on slide two. Operating earnings per share of $0.27 were largely in line with our expectations. While we continued our disciplined focus on cost reductions and productivity, our results again were significantly impacted by currency, challenges in ag markets, particularly in Brazil and the continued weakness in emerging markets. Segment results declined $0.23 per share in the quarter, including a $0.17 per share negative impact from currency, primarily the Brazilian real.","Full year operating earnings per share were $2.77 versus 3.36 in the prior year. Currency negatively impacted results by $0.71 per share. Excluding the currency impact for the full year, operating EPS would have increased by 4%. Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter of $5.3 billion declined 1%. Currency negatively impacted sales by an additional 8 percentage points. The dollar remains strong relative to most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real.","Turning now to slide three, consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to the segment results. Segment results excluding currency were down $0.06 per share year-over-year, as growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, Performance Materials, Safety & Protection, and Electronics & Communications. Net after-tax exchange gains and losses were a $0.04 headwind in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the recent currency devaluation in Argentina. A higher tax rate reduced operating EPS by 0.03 per share in the quarter. A continued shift to a higher percentage of our earnings in the U.S. and Canada versus prior year resulted in this higher tax rate. While changes in corporate expense did not impact quarterly results, I would like to highlight that for the full year decreases in corporate expenses contributed $0.09 to earnings, reflecting our focus on cost reductions and productivity.","Slide four illustrates our geographic footprint in the fourth quarter. Our sales in the U.S. and Canada continued to grow as a percentage of total scales, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide five. Operating earnings growth in Industrial Biosciences and Nutrition & Health was more than offset by declines in the remaining segments.","Industrial Biosciences operating earnings grew 25% on cost reductions and continued productivity. Operating margins improved by 450 basis points. Volume growth in enzymes, particularly in food and home and personal care was offset by some declines in biomaterials.","Nutrition & Health improvement was led by cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for probiotics, cultures and ingredient systems, which more than offset the negative currency impact. Operating margins in this segment improved by 110 basis points and have now grown year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters.","In Agriculture an operating loss of $54 million resulted in a $188 million of lower operating earnings. Increases in local price, cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by $139 million negative currency impact. Prior year results benefited from a timing impact from performance-based compensation adjustments and a $36 million gain from portfolio actions. Excluding the impact of currency, the segment would have reported operating earnings of $85 million.","Performance Materials operating earnings were down as cost reductions, continued productivity and increased demand for performance polymers offerings in global automotive markets was more than offset by lower ethylene price and volume along with currency. Average ethylene spot prices are down over 60% year-over-year and continue to significantly impact, both top-line and bottom-line segment results.","Fourth quarter operating earnings for Safety & Protection declined as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by lower demand and currency. Demand from the oil and gas industry, and the military segment remained soft, which impacted sales in Nomex thermal resistant fiber as well as Kevlar high-strength materials and our sustainable solutions offerings.","Electronics & Communications operating results decreased $5 million as cost reductions and continued productivity were more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.","As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor center website under events and presentations. I encourage you to refer to these slides for further details on the segment results including our expectations for the first quarter and full year 2016.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet and cash on slide six. Let me start by explaining that our cash flow analysis includes Chemours for both 2015 and 2014. As you can see on the slide our free cash flow decreased by about $1 billion from prior year. About $650 million of the decline related to the Chemours transaction; remainder was due to lower cash earnings from ongoing businesses year-over-year. As Ed indicated, we\u2019re very focused on our cost structure, working capital discipline, and capital spending, and our plans to address these areas as part of our 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program should improve our free cash flow in 2016.","We ended 2015 with a net debt of $2.6 billion versus $3.6 billion in 2014. The change from prior year is due to a decrease in gross debt year-over-year, as a result of debt maturing during the year. Year-end cash balances were about $6 billion. In the quarter, we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, using proceeds from the Chemours separation. Under the program, we received and retired about 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share.","Average diluted shares outstanding for the full year were above 900 million and about 882 million for the fourth quarter. For 2016, we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 875 million shares, primarily reflecting the benefit of the 2015 share repurchases and the share repurchases scheduled in the second half of 2016.","On slide seven, our operational redesign program delivered $0.10 of savings in the quarter and $0.40 of cost savings for the full year 2015. This resulted in operating margin improvements in five out of our six segments for the full year. As we move into 2016, we will continue to aggressively focus on cost reduction in accordance with the plan we announced in December.","As Ed mentioned, we have identified an additional $100 million of cost reductions, increasing our total run rate savings to $1 billion, which translates into approximately $730 million of savings in \u201816 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per share in cost reductions, which will be waited towards the second half of 2016 as we implement specific actions in the first and second quarters. Of the $1 billion in run rate savings, about three-fourths will come from SG&A. Included in these reductions is a decrease of about $200 million in corporate expense. On an operating earnings basis, corporate expenses as a percent of sales will improve to about 1.3% in 2016 from 2.3% in 2015.","Turning now to slide eight, I would like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in 2016. These assumptions form the foundation for our 2016 guidance. As we saw in 2015, the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against most currencies and will be a headwind for us again in 2016. We expect global growth of about 2% on an overall slowdown in global trade driven by weaknesses in emerging markets and in particular, uncertainty in China. We expect global industrial production to increase about 2% in 2016. Europe continues to gradually improve and expand manufacturing, while the U.S. will be challenged due to tepid global demand and a stronger dollar. China\u2019s slowing and uncertainty remains a concern as we continue to see a shift from industrial production to services and consumer sectors. In Agriculture, the fundamentals remain challenging as net farm income continues to decline. Auto growth is expected to continue with 3% growth year-over-year.","With this backdrop, let\u2019s turn now to slide nine. We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales would be about even with prior year.","The Company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales excluding currency. Our guidance reflects a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. The estimate also includes headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share of currency impact due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and $0.05 to $0.10 per share from a higher base tax rate, reflecting our expectations of the geographic mix of earnings.","We continue to see slowing growth in emerging markets which is shifting our earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to a further weakening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Given the seasonality of our operating earnings from agriculture in the Northern Hemisphere, we anticipate approximately two thirds of the expected currency impact to occur in the first half of 2016.","Excluding currency, we would expect earnings growth of 17% to 23%, including the full year benefit of cost savings and share repurchases. For the full year, we expect our base tax rate to be about 23%, an increase from prior year due to the geographic mix of earnings. This represents, as I mentioned, $0.05 to $0.10 headwind in the outlook. Benefits from a lower share count will be partially offset by higher interest cost in 2016. Interest expense will increase as a result of our reduced commercial paper market capacity. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.1 billion. Excluding Chemours, this represents about a $300 million decline year-over-year and reflects our commitment to improving our capital allocation process, as we scrutinize returns on a project-by-project basis.","In 2016, we will continue to exclude from operating earnings, non-operating pension and OPEB costs, as well as costs associated with the planned merger of equals.","With that let me turn the call back over to Ed.","Ed Breen","Great, thank you Nick. I would like to walk you through our priorities for 2016; it\u2019s simple, we have three. One, delivering growth and operating earnings, an important driver here is delivering the $1 billion in run rate cost savings and the organizational efficiencies that come with the restructuring. Equally important, we are placing a lot of emphasis on keeping the business steady and on track. Our people are very focused on connecting even more closely with customers to deliver the value added solutions they expect from DuPont. Two is driving improved capital allocation and working capital performance to generate more cash and to enhance our returns. Three, closing the merger, planning for synergies and preparing for the intended separations.","Let me now say a few words about the merger of equals with Dow which we announced in December and which will be named DowDuPont. As we said at the time, we intend to combine two complementary portfolios to create three strong, highly focused, independent businesses well equipped to deliver growth and long-term sustainable value. Each business would target attractive markets, where combined science, technology and operational expertise will drive value for our stakeholders. We are focused on completing the merger in the second half of 2016 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by both DuPont and Dow shareholders.","We\u2019ve identified the priority work streams and established our teams. We have begun the process of addressing the requirements under various competition laws including a Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the U.S. We\u2019re also focused on the preparation of the merge co-registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC. The initial filing will be made after each of DuPont and Dow filed their annual reports with the Commission in February.","In December, we said that we expect the combined company to realize $3 billion in cost synergies. Each company has chartered a dozen formal business and functional integration and synergy planning teams to develop detailed, execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the companies post merger and capture our anticipated costs and growth synergies.","The functional teams include legal, sourcing, logistics, supply chain, HR, finance, IT, faculties among others. All of these teams are focused on planning for seamless business operations on day one after the merger and quickly capturing our planned synergies. These teams are chartered to ensure we plan to leverage the most effective operating models, channels to market and industry best practices upon the creation of DowDuPont.","Just a few examples of the planning work the teams are doing include reviewing our warehouse and facilities footprint, evaluating IT platforms for savings and developing integration plans for our transactional processes. As announced, we intend to pursue the separation of DowDuPont into three separate public companies after our merger is complete, an agriculture company, a material science company, and a specialty products company. We are doing all that we can now to expedite the timing of the spins including beginning work on the carve-out financial statements for the separate companies.","In conclusion, 2016 is a pivotal and transformation year for DuPont as we accelerate our value creation work, invest in our core franchises and position our businesses for competitive future. We will give you regular updates on our progress.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Friedman","Thanks, Ed. We\u2019ll open the line for questions now. John, if you would please give the instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.","Jeff Zekauskas ","In going [ph] through your slides, it looks like you think your agricultural operating income will be down about $250 million in the first quarter, but you think it would be flat for the year. How might you accomplish that? And secondly, in choosing the heads of the separated companies, will there be a procedure where you go outside both Dow and DuPont to compare candidates from outside the companies as well as candidates inside the companies or will those leaders essentially be chosen from inside both companies?","Ed Breen","Yes, Jeff. This is Ed; I\u2019ll take that your second question then turn it over to Jim Collins for the ag question. So, we will have a process in place where we will look both externally and internally in the company. We are setting up a process for that that is not just for who the CEOs will be, but there is obviously many other key public company positions that need to be staffed. I would certainly hope that some of that staffing obviously is going to be from key people in the companies, but our master [ph] is going to be best staff we can get to run the businesses. Jim, do you want to take?","Jim Collins","Sure, thanks Jeff. You\u2019re right. When you look at full year operating earnings, we\u2019re about flat and that\u2019s primarily driven by local pricing gains in North America with new germplasms they have for Pioneer seed and corn, and transition to our T Series soybean. So we\u2019re getting some good pricing momentum there. And obviously, we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of our cost reduction efforts flow through. These are dramatically offset clearly again by the currency impact, and we are having some impacts primarily in crop protection and in soybeans in Brazil. For example, if you excluded currency for the full year, we would be up about 10% in operating earnings.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Ed, just on a cost savings, ex the Dow merger, how much more you think was available to DuPont, so beyond $1 billion of savings you\u2019ve targeted already?","Ed Breen","Look, there is always cost savings. I mean I am a believer that they occur every year in a few percent range, as you keep streamlining your company, I would say. So, you are never done with it. I think where there was more cost savings, David, in DuPont was when we could get up on a IT platform because that would really streamline some of our G&A back office; unfortunately we\u2019re not; we\u2019re on a very fragmented IT system. One of the benefits it looks like we obviously get here with the Dow merger is Dow is on the IT platform that we were going through the global -- actually latest revision of the SAP platform. And so between the work we did here on that platform and the work they -- obviously already up on that platform, that\u2019s where -- and let me just use the ag company as an example. Their ag business is on the platform, if we can translate ourselves on to that platform, that\u2019s where there would be cost savings or I guess to back that up, if DuPont would have stayed on its own of course over the next couple of years getting that platform up and running that\u2019s where more costs would have come out of the Company, mostly in the G&A area. But we will get that benefit quicker in the merger if we can merge on to that platform. The teams have already met on that a couple of times. I actually sat in one of those meetings actually up in Midland at the Dow corporate office with the teams and we\u2019re feeling very bullish about that prospect to lean on to that platform.","David Begleiter","And just for Jim, Jim expectations for crop chemical pricing in 2016 year-over-year?","Jim Collins","It is going to continue to be a pretty challenging market where we\u2019ve got some inventory carryovers that we\u2019re dealing with both in Latin America, lowering lower insect pressure that we saw here in the fourth quarter and the impact of insect protected varieties of soybeans that are out there. I think in North America, we look at the market in general and see that it will be another challenging environment. We do have some new product launches that will be coming out, our fungicide and our insecticide, [ph] so that will help us from a mix standpoint.","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks, two questions. First, you talked about getting a lot of local pricing in the seed business, in both North America and South America but your remarks in the slide deck as well as some competitor commentary talk about is very competitive environment. So, I was wondering if you can reconcile, it sounds like you are expecting to see net pricing gains but you are also seeing some competition; so what do you see going on in the marketplace?","Jim Collins","Yes, thanks. Fourth quarter, you saw some of the impact of the pricing actions that we took primarily in our crop protection business in Latin America and that was largely that to mitigate the currency impact. We also look forward; we\u2019ve got new genetics, [ph] something in North America. So, I look at our pricing book year-over-year for like products. We\u2019re about flat, and you add to that the conversion to T Series soybeans in North America and the new genetics in corn and plus the launch, the continued launch of our products like Leptra in Brazil. That Leptra ramp up in Safrinha was good but in summer corn, could be one of the largest ramp ups that we\u2019ve had in our history. So, it\u2019s going to be tough, it will be competitive but we feel good about the lineup that we have going forward.","Vincent Andrews","And then separately in Performance Materials, there were comments about the weakness in spot ethylene prices but contract ethylene is much stronger than spot. So, I\u2019m just wondering why -- how exposed are you to the spot market and what is the opportunity to get that exposure more towards the contract side of things?","Ed Breen","When you look at the spot prices, like we said, it\u2019s down about 60% on a year-over-year basis. Exposure, we\u2019re -- about half of our output is exposed to these external market spot prices. And as you are well aware, the driver here is the reduction in oil and the competition being naphtha based and the impact that\u2019s having on us even though we\u2019re natural gas supplier.","Operator","And our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","A question on the capital allocation, if -- using your guidance of 2016 and sort of back of the envelop I get to you guys getting somewhere $3.5 billion in operating income. But you say you\u2019re going to spend about $4.5 billion on CapEx dividends and share repurchases and that\u2019s excluding any merger cost. So, I\u2019d assume, at least another $0.5 or so from all the costs associated with restructuring and merger. So, are you guys planning on going into debt or how are you thinking about your position there?","Ed Breen","When you look at the cash uses next year, we are anticipating obviously dividends, extremely important to the Company in the past and the future. And so dividends are going to be about $1.3 billion. We are reducing our CapEx from the levels in the past of about 1.4 to 1.5 down about $1.1 billion. And as we said in the commentary, that\u2019s in line with our depreciation, amortization. We made the commitments on the $2 billion of share repurchase; we are committed to accomplishing that. We\u2019re limited right now on our ability to enter the market because of the transaction that\u2019s going on, and we will have that limitation probably through the proxy vote. But then after that, we\u2019ll be looking to enter the marketplace on that.","So when you add all that up, you\u2019re right, there is a higher cash train versus the operating income, but we\u2019re also looking at driving some working capital improvements. This is an area that we have focus on; we had some improvements, slight improvement in our working capital turns this year. But we\u2019re looking at attacking all three areas, receivables; inventory; payables. And we believe, if we can get to best in class in these areas that we can liberate another $1 billion plus of cash in the medium-term. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re driving our efforts.","Operator","Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","First question for Jim; Latin American or Brazilian in particular soy corn share, you\u2019ve got a couple of trends, obviously Leptra should help down there, you\u2019ve struggled with the Bt resistance on some of the corn. How do you see those two playing out against each other this year and where would you anticipate ending up in corn for this year?","Jim Collins","We continue to see some pretty competitive challenges in corn seed in Brazil, especially in the summer season. And we lost some share in 2015. It\u2019s a little too early to size what that might be, based on planted acres. We are excited about the launch of Leptra hybrids. We\u2019ve got some of those coming in to the Safrinha season. And then we would expect that to be about 10% of our Safrinha volume. And then as we start to think about that 2016 full summer season, and this would be one of the fastest ramp ups of new trade in our portfolio. So, we\u2019ll have much more significant volumes of that going forward.","In soybeans, it\u2019s a little too early to comment on final share. Clearly we did face some competitive pressure in Brazil, based on the adoption of the inset protected soybean varieties that were out there. And we\u2019re collaborating with our crop protection colleagues in the use of seed treatments to offset some of that. And so we\u2019ll have to be back to you later as the season unfolds to really range just how that unfolded.","Duffy Fischer","And then Ed, we\u2019ve been hearing now for little over two years, probably about the competitive dynamics hurting the Solamet paste. Is it fair to think about that is kind of commoditized at this point or is that still specialty product that we can see a nice rebound in?","Ed Breen","Yes, you will see a nice rebound there with the launch at the end of the year, beginning of the year, but there is another launch of a product coming out about mid-year that we feel will be much more competitive as we move forward there. Nick, you might want to comment on that.","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, I think Ed characterized it right. It is a business that the competition has gotten more intense but it\u2019s still a business that relies a lot on innovation and development of new products. We issued one in December that kind of leveled the playing field; we\u2019re starting to see the impact of that, and we have one scheduled for the second half of the year that we believe is going to give us a leg up again from a competitive standpoint, so in second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Could you speak a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on the industrial markets order flow and how much visibility you have supporting the outlook for the 3% light vehicle production growth?","Ed Breen","Well, certainly the industrial production index, as well as global GDP are under pressure, and we\u2019re seeing that across the globe. We did see auto builds about 2% up for the year; we\u2019re forecasting it to be through IHS as a database there, around 3% for the year, next year 2% to 3% and for the first quarter about 2%, in line with what happened in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that in China, there was a major stimulus that was launched in that fourth quarter rose the year-over-year fourth quarter numbers up 8%; so starting to see some of that stimulus incentive impacting the industrial numbers as well.","Oil and gas continues to be a weakening area for us and obviously with the prices that are out there from the oil base. And so that\u2019s impacting some of our other industrial businesses as well. It\u2019s interesting to note though that -- and I don\u2019t want to say there is a trend here, but our fourth quarter organic revenue was actually our best of the year. We had been running kind of minus 3% through the first nine months of the year and we are minus 1% in the fourth quarter. And if you kind of look at it around the geographies, it was kind of flat in Latin America, flat in North America, pretty flat in Asia and our one down market was Europe which was down about 2%. So, we\u2019ll see how the trend goes here in the first half of the year but that was little bit encouraging that we saw that lift.","Operator","Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts","Do you know where the ag company will be headquartered yet?","Ed Breen","We have not made that announcement yet; I would expect we will make that in the next few weeks. We\u2019ve been going through that analysis. And it\u2019s something we want to get out there by the way for whole bunch of reasons but the number one reason in my mind is for our employees, so they understand and have some clarity on that. So, we\u2019re moving as fast as we can to get that announced. And it will be in the next few weeks.","John Roberts","And then the Asian volume was flat in the quarter but the Electronics & Communications segment was down pretty materially. How did Asia end up flat with the electronics segment so weak?","Nick Fanandakis","Well we saw increases in volume growth in Nutrition & Health, was up about 11%, IB was up. And when you take up the PV [ph] which was the biggest part of the E&C, E&C would have actually had a good quarter as well. So, we did see offsetting areas where we saw strength in that region.","Ed Breen","And that applies directly just to China and N&H was up there, IB was up, Ag was up, and PV was down. So, that\u2019s kind of the offset.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","Just a couple of questions, your R&D expense of roughly $1.9 billion in 2016, can you tell us how much of that was in Ag and where do you see that R&D expense growing next year?","Ed Breen","Let me talk R&D in total and then Jim you might want to add some color or commentary. But about half of our R&D in the Company is in Ag. And by the reductions that we have done, just to put that in perspective, takes our R&D to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. And I think we are very selective in how we did it. And one of the things if you look back historically just to put this in perspective because I know there has been a lot said and talked about it, but through the last 15 years the R&D has averaged in DuPont $1.65 billion and that\u2019s a run rate over 15 years. And actually from 2000 to 2010 it was $200 million lower than that and then there was a little bit of a ramp up to bring that average up to the 1,650. And that\u2019s exactly about where we are going to be as we move forward through 2016 and on.","So, we are at a very heavy robust level; we\u2019re still one of the highest R&D companies in the world. And it\u2019s not off of run rate that the Company has run at for many-many years. Any other commentary on the Ag, Jim you want to add?","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, a little bit. As we really back in 2014, we started to take a continued, more focused look at where our spending was trending and trying to stay focused on the things that could really move the needle in terms of the new genetics and things like our T Series soybeans worked in the new genetics in corn. Overall from a corporate perspective, we spend about 75% of our R&D in agriculture on sees and the balance of that in crop protection. In the seed business, about 40% of that or so would be on breeding and product testing and advancing the new genetics through to commercialization, another 40% is on things like enabling technologies that allow us to produce seed more efficiently, characterization, trade integration, things like seed production technology, and then the balance of that actually at a much smaller portion would be focused on discovery, on trade discovery and development. And we\u2019ve been ramping up our efforts in areas around insect control in corn, key agronomic trades like drought and nitrogen, and then continuing to work on our own programs around soy insect control as well as soy output trades, things like our [Indiscernible] that would be out there in marketplace.","P.J. Juvekar","And just quickly, when do you expect to 40% [ph] if you could come back? Thanks.","Nick Fanandakis","If you look back at 2015, financially it did have an impact based on year-over-year, some of that was from lower volumes that we just didn\u2019t have to sell and some of that was from the fixed overhead cost that we had at that site to continue to flow through. We have forecasted and expect the impact of the report shutdowns to continue throughout the year of 2016. And we continue to work with regulators. And at this point we really don\u2019t yet have a timeline for when the report shutdown would be resolved. So, it\u2019s later in the year we were able to get that resolved and started back up that would actually be a tailwind for us. In our current outlook, we\u2019re not counting on it.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank Mitsch","Nick, I know you\u2019re really busy this week with the earnings and snow, so you probably missed some of the football this week. And I would just suggest you go back and check it out, because Cam Newton was really amazing.","Nick Fanandakis","Yes, I don\u2019t think I have to worry about that anymore.","Frank Mitsch","Ed, I know you\u2019re busy this week and also with [indiscernible] but also busy upsizing the cost reductions, 2016 goes from 700 to 730; run rate 900 million to 1 billion, that\u2019s after one month, because you rolled these numbers out one month ago. And you also rolled out -- you and Andrew rolled out a $3 billion number a month ago in terms of synergies for the combined entities. If I extrapolate out your upsizing here, I come out to $6 billion by September. Obviously that\u2019s not right. But how should we be thinking, now that you\u2019re a month into the progress, you\u2019ve got a couple of teams together working on the synergy; how should we think about the combined synergies of DowDuPont?","Ed Breen","Yes. And let me just clarify again, to your comments, our cost reduction of $1 billion is separate from the DowDuPont $3 billion. And on our $1 billion, we\u2019re moving obviously as rapidly as we can. I want to get that out of the way and how things settle down for the Company and all that. So, we\u2019re moving as fast as we can and we did identify more and so we\u2019re moving on that.","The interesting thing on the $3 billion of the synergies with Dow, we have broken that out by all those key buckets we mentioned in our prepared remarks. The teams are meeting, as my comment was one of our big opportunities is this IT platform, that\u2019s why I got personally involved in it, because if we can overlay onto that, there is a huge opportunity. But if you look back at our charts, there is 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion in Ag that is very identified at this point in time. And there is so much overlap in the supply chain, the manufacturing chain, the sales chain. And by the way the percentages we\u2019re talking about on the Ag side are very similar to other transactions of similar type companies there.","And then, we\u2019re in good shape, looking at the synergies on the specialty company. A lot of that comes from the combination of the electronics businesses from Dow and DuPont coming together and the synergies, then we have on the material side are identified. But where we\u2019re still working and we have a lot of opportunity is the purchasing supply chain, as I mentioned the IT and then we have a great opportunity to look at more shared services across the whole platform. And that\u2019s where hundreds of millions of dollars of savings could come from there.","So, it\u2019s a combination of all that. Now, we\u2019re doing a lot of heavy on. So for instance, in the supply chain area between the two companies, just to give you, we have hundreds of warehouses around the world and we don\u2019t need that when we come together. So that is work you can\u2019t do in one week; that\u2019s going to take us the next three or four months literally identifying every single one and going work merging converts together. [Ph] So a little bit heavy lifting on that supply chain, purchasing, IT side and then the shared service, how do we want to move two more for a lot of the back office work which will reduce our G&A.","So, I really plan and we\u2019re really pushing with the teams that we are totally identified on the 3 billion minimum by the time we get to close a merger, so we can move immediately on it. And I would also say I would be very helpful that the $3 billion is our floor number and not the ceiling number. And if we can get more out of that, obviously we\u2019re going to just move on it.","Frank Mitsch","That\u2019s very helpful, I appreciate the color there. And then just operationally on safety and protection. I know you guys highlighted oil and gas being weak, no surprise there. You also talked about military being weak. Can you offer some commentary on what you\u2019re seeing there and what your expectations are for the military side?","Ed Breen","Well, it\u2019s really delays in the tenders and spending there. So, it\u2019s more of a timing thing than a cancellation thing. And so it\u2019s difficult, Frank, to predict exactly when that\u2019s going to free up again on the spending side of it. But those tenders are in place, and it\u2019s just a matter of when they get executed against.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","Question for Jim on Ag. Jim, you talked about how crop protection sales were down 24% in the fourth quarter and in your slides. What was the full year impact? And could you sort of sight what the key factors were, how much of that was channel destock in Brazil, how much was La Porte? And what\u2019s your expectation for crop protection sales in \u201816 versus \u201815?","Jim Collins","So, I did talk a little bit about the impact in fourth quarter volumes related to the insect-protected varieties down in Brazil. So that was one impact. We will expect to see that carry over as well. Paste pressure is another aspect; again it\u2019s difficult to predict what we\u2019re going to see going forward. If we think about 2016, just overall total macroeconomics, we\u2019re predicting net farm income and net farm prices for growers to be challenged. And from the past, as they start to make purchasing decisions, lock in lands, they will secure their seed and they\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ve got their fertility programs right and then sort of back into what their crop protection regime is going to be. On top of that for our own business, we\u2019re missing some volumes associated with the La Porte. And so that kind of all adds to that picture, so overall, strong competitive market. I think on the offset there, we\u2019ve got a strong crop protection pipeline that continues to come forward. We\u2019re not into the full blown launch of [Indiscernible] here. We\u2019ll expect to see some recovery in [indiscernible] volumes especially in places like Asia Pacific in foods and vegetables; on fungicide, Zorvec, early days, but starting to get some traction on that and our new insecticide Prexil. [Ph] So, those are couple of areas that would offset some of that in the downside and Prexil, [Ph] we\u2019re really just getting some testing going on that the full launch of will be in 2017.","Don Carson","As you look to the merger with Dow in ag, any trust concerns on corn seed markets here either in the U.S. or Brazil and Argentina?","Jim Collins","No. I think if I look at the overlap of our portfolios, we have a very complementary set of products, both on the seed side and the chemistry side. Dow got some very strong brands that looking at how we go to market with not only the Pioneer brand but our PROaccess brand makes a modest sense of then how we might mange through that. And then as Ed said earlier, as we start to look at the synergies, looking at our supply chains and how we produce seed globally looking at our go to market efficiencies, both in seed and crop protection and then taking a step back and looking at both our R&D and our G&A overheads where we\u2019re totally duplicative, taking very aggressive approach there as well.","Operator","And it\u2019s from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Byrne","Just a couple of more for Jim. You\u2019ve looked at the feasibility of transferring the products from La Porte to one of the Dow ag facilities post merger and what\u2019s your outlook for channel inventory levels of crop protection down in south America at the end of Safrinha season?","Jim Collins","So I\u2019ll take the second one first. We do expect to see some challenging inventories as that insect control market in the fourth quarter last year really died on; its\u2019 the combination of just lower paste pressure and the impact of insect protected soybean varieties that we\u2019re in that market. So inventories have been challenged. Now we saw some of that coming in and we started to take some actions to correct for that but still will have some pressure there.","On La Porte and Lannate and some opportunities there, it\u2019s really way too early to be thinking about those kinds of actions. We\u2019re just in the early days of thinking through integration and certainly those might be opportunities but those would really come once the merger was complete, we have a chance to really sit down with our counterparts and understand what their capabilities are.","Greg Friedman","Great. Well, thanks everybody for joining the call today. The IR team is available for your further questions, and we ask that you have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for all participating. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
