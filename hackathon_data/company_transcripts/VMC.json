My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","Now, I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark Warren","Welcome everyone to Vulcan Materials\u2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s call is accompanied by a press release issued this morning and a supplemental presentation posted to our website. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay later today.","Before we begin, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results, the projections -- and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. 2019 represented another year of strong earnings growth and demonstrated the strength of our aggregate-centric business model.","But before we talk about our accomplishments for the year, I want to spend a few minutes telling you about the good progress we made again in the fourth quarter. Aggregates gross profit was $274 million, a 7% improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter. Aggregates shipments increased by 4%, with markets in the Southeast and Southwest reporting strong growth.","For the quarter, freight adjusted average sales prices increased by 5.5%, all key markets reported year-over-year price growth. And the 70 basis point benefit from mix was due in part to above average growth in Gulf Coast markets. They are severed by our unparalleled logistics network. This growth is noteworthy.","The fourth quarter of 2018 made for a tough comparison with a 24% increase in Aggregates gross profit, 8% growth in volume, and 5% mix adjusted price growth over 2017. Gross profit per ton in the quarter improved $5.32 and was negatively impacted by three things, most of which are timing and mix related.","First, repair and maintenance costs were higher in the quarter. As we said before, certain types of repairs and maintenance are routine and scheduled. Therefore, the associated costs are more predicable. ","Other repair maintenance activities are planned annually, but the exact timing is more difficult to predict with precision. You monitor the situation throughout the year to determine the optimal time to do the work and as a result the cost can be lumpier. This quarter includes several of these types of repairs.","In addition, the rigorous inspection and maintenance protocol that we rolled out as part of our operational excellence initiative in early 2019 grow some of our costs higher in the second half of the year. We expect to continue to see additional repair and maintenance costs in 2020 and have incorporated them in our guidance. Setting high standards is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business.","Our employees are highly engaged, and they are focused intently on the mobile equipment and fixed plant inspection and maintenance aspects of this initiative. In doing so, we can preempt or avoid equipment failures, which could result in much more expensive repair cost.","The second factor that impacted our gross profit in Aggregates was actual geographic mix versus our expectations. Our fourth quarter shipments were robust in markets along the -- along the Gulf Coast, which are served by rail and water. Remote serve markets carry higher selling prices, but also carry higher cost, particularly if the tons are shipped by rail versus blue water. In the fourth quarter higher volumes from rail distribution, negatively affected margins.","The third factor was lower revenue and earnings from certain aggregates locations, which also generate tipping fees on clean fill. This result was mainly a matter of timing of projects expected to contribute to the fourth quarter. Instead, the projects were delayed, but will benefit 2020. ","Finally, I'll also highlight our fourth quarter asphalt results, where gross profit increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter last year. This was driven by 10% improvement in shipments and a 3% improvement in average selling prices. In addition, we expect -- we experienced volume growth in California, in spite of wet weather in the fourth quarter. These volume and price improvements in addition to a 12% reduction in the average unit costs for liquid asphalt drove a 52% improvement in unit profitability in asphalt.","Suzanne will share with you the detailed numbers in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our full year 2019 accomplishments and talk about why we're excited about 2020. Let's start with the most important aspect of our business safety.","In 2019, our people led us to another year of world class safety performance despite being busier than ever. We also completed the rollout of all of our strategic initiatives commercial excellence, operational excellence, logistics, innovation and strategic sourcing. We believe these initiatives will help us accelerate growth towards our long-term goals.","On the financial side, aggregate shipments grew by 7% and average freight adjusted sales price was 5.6% better than 2018. Aggregates gross profit increased by 16%, and unit profitability grew by 8%.","Cash gross profit per ton was $6.74, another step forward on the path to our longer term goal of $9 per ton. And while our Non-Aggregates segment gross profit was flat year-over-year, the second half showed signs of improving trends in the Asphalt business.","Our adjusted EBITDA for the year grew by 12%. And importantly, our return on invested capital increase to 13.9%. As a whole, we were pleased with our annual results. But we aren't satisfied with just setting records. Our focus is on getting better every day and reaching our potential.","As we enter 2020, we are well-positioned to take advantage of supportive markets and deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. Our markets will continue to benefit from both public construction demand led by highways and a resurgence in demand on the private side, particularly residential.","The public highway demand is there, as all the revenues to support the investment. As we seemed -- excuse me -- as we said before, it's not a matter of if, but rather when the projects are finally started and shipments begin. To be fair, we seem -- we've been a little bit disappointed over the last couple of months with the speed with which the states are letting work. However, we remain confident that these projects are a go in the near to medium term.","With respect to residential demand, which we've been a bit cautious, but now we're seeing a very positive turn in leading indicators, with Vulcan markets outpacing the rest of the country. Underlying demand fundamentals, including population and employment growth remain firmly in place and underpin our expectations of growth in private, residential and non-residential construction.","These demand characteristics a catalyst for positive pricing environment in 2020. And demand visibility is also an important contributor. With our geographic footprint, focus on the higher growth markets, we are in the best position to capitalize on public and private demand.","So what does all this mean for 2020? We anticipate a 2% to 4% growth rate in aggregate shipments. Aggregate freight adjusted sales prices are expected to increase between 4% and 6%. Additionally, we maintain our longer term view of approximately 60% same-store flow through rate to gross profit on a trailing 12 month basis. Overall, we are looking at double-digit growth in Aggregate segment earnings.","Moving to our Construction Product segment, we expect 10% to 15% growth in gross profit collectively. This contemplates relatively stable, liquid cost in Asphalt.","I'll now turn it over to Suzanne for further comments on our 2019 full year performance and 2020 guidance.","Suzanne Wood","Thanks, Tom and good morning to everyone. In 2019, our Aggregates volume growth reflected the solid underlying demand fundamentals in our market, including growth in population, households and jobs. That is two to three times that of other markets over the next 10 years. ","Shipments in certain markets in the Southeast, Mid Atlantic and Texas were particularly strong. Average sales prices in Aggregates increased and higher prices were widespread, with all major markets reporting improvement.","For the full year our costs were up 4%, contributing to a 48% same-store aggregates flow through rate. As Tom mentioned, there were several factors that affected this rate, particularly in the fourth quarter.","Our segment gross profit increased by 16%. This continued progression underpins our ability to deliver attractive earnings growth. SAG expenses while higher in absolute dollar terms decreased as a percentage of total revenues.","Moving on now to the balance sheet, cash flows and return on investment. We made progress in each of these areas. Our balance sheet structure remains strong, with a weighted average debt maturity of 14 years, and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. Leverage was reduced from 2.6 to 2.2 times, well within our target range.","We generated $820 million of discretionary cash flow and we followed our capital allocation priorities to determine the most shareholder returns enhancing use of that cash. In 2019, this included investments and attractive growth opportunities, as well as return of cash through dividends and share repurchases. And as a result, our return on invested capital improved by 130 basis points on an adjusted EBITDA basis.","I'll move on now from 2019 to 2020. Tom has already covered the operational aspects of our segment guidance, so I'll comment on a few other points. SAG expenses are forecast to be approximate $365 million in 2020. This represents a reduction in absolute dollars, as well as the reduction in the ratio of expense to revenue. We already have taken steps to ensure we are efficiently leveraging our overhead.","We anticipate that interest expense will approximate $125 million and that depreciation depletion, accretion and amortization will approximate $385 million in 2020. And our effective tax rate -- our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%.","The combination of these assumptions lead us to an adjusted EBITDA range of $1.385 billion to $1.485 billion for 2020. The midpoint of this range represents a 13% increase as compared to 2019.","Moving onto our cash flow expectations. Remember that our business is an inherently cash generative one, and 2020 will be no exception. We anticipate discretionary cash flow of approximately $800 million. As you model our cash flows, I'll share some thoughts to help you fill in the blanks.","As guideposts, we will continue to adhere to our unchanged capital allocation priorities in directing our uses of cash, and we will stay within our target leverage range. We expect the cash interest expense of $120 million, operating and maintenance CapEx of $275 million and finally, cash taxes of $180 million.","The discretionary uses of our cash involved returns to shareholders, internal growth capital in acquisitions. Let me cover each one of those. First, we expect to maintain a progressive dividend, generally growing it in line with earnings to a level that is fully sustainable through the cycle. ","Second, we expect to spend approximately $200 million on growth CapEx for projects that are already largely underway, as we did not spend the full amount of growth capital we projected in 2019. These projects include the opening of a new quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries, as well as improvements to our logistics and distribution network and sales yards.","And third, we will continue our disciplined evaluation of acquisition opportunities as they arise, only investing in those which fit our strategy and offer superior returns and synergies. And last, we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Thanks, Suzanne. Now before we go to Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of Vulcan Materials for their hard work and their dedication. They have taken good care of our customers and have improved our business processes and disciplines. Importantly, they promoted our strong safety culture and are responsible for delivering our industry leading safety metrics.","As we move forward, we will continue to capitalize on our strengths, our aggregates focused business, our outstanding geographic footprint and our local execution capabilities. We will also remain focus on compounding our unit margins through the cycle and improving our return on invested capital.","Now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Our first question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Stanley Elliott","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Tom, could you talk a little bit about the cost structure kind of puts and takes as we're heading into 2020? You mentioned some of that being played in the current guide. Does any of this roll off? Just trying -- curious to see how you guys were thinking about the cost piece.","Tom Hill","Sure. If you look at the fourth quarter, the average cost or unit profitability was, as I said, was impacted by three unique items. And pretty much equally, all three of those items are somewhat of accommodation of mix and timing. The first one is a large clean fill project, which we will we take dirt in the quarry for tipping fee. The job was temporarily stopped, but it will start back up in 2020. So, we'll see that again, we'll get that back.","The second item was really geographic mix. It was increased volumes to remote distribution rail yards on the Gulf Coast, which is a good thing. It just comes at a higher cost, with the simple reason that you experienced not only the quarry costs, but also the yard costs. And you couple that with -- we had a little bit lower volumes in the Mid Atlantic states really due to the timing of work.","And then the third item was increased equipment maintenance cost is really driven by our equipment inspection efforts as part of our operational excellence efforts, which we kicked off in February last year. And this is really to prevent catastrophic equipment failure. It improves operating efficiencies and actually improves customer service. And while the costs were higher in Q3 and Q4, because of these efforts, our long-term focus on maintenance is just the right decision for the company.","Now, those efforts will benefit us later this year. As over time, it improves cost by helping to eliminate expensive failure costs and really the expense of downtime. And I would expect some of these costs to continue for a bit into 2020. But all that's built into our full year 2020 guidance, and I got to tell you I'm very pleased. This takes a lot of work and a lot of effort and I please will operators performance here.","Stanley Elliott","No doubt. And then sticking on the cost side, can you just speak to the leverage you\u2019re seeing on the SAG line? I wanted to call SG&A, but I feel like that tracking below 7% of sales, maybe one of the best the company's history. Talk a little bit about how you're driving that down when your revenues are going to be up double-digits.","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. Sure. I'm happy to do that. And good morning to you. The SAG area, which is predominantly corporate and administrative type costs, is an area where we are continually focusing our attention. If you look at the fourth quarter and you look at full year of 2019, while the absolute dollar amount is higher, we did reduce it as a -- cost as a percentage of revenue and that's something that we had been really focused on as part of our budgeting process.","And as we move into 2020 I mean, look, we want to make sure that we are delivering the appropriate services to our operational folks. And we have looked across the footprint, particularly in those corporate and admin functions for ways to be more efficient and effective in delivering those important services to people, and sometimes that is just finding more efficient ways to do things. Sometimes, it's using technology. You just use a number of things at your disposal to try to effect some change. So, you'll see those efforts which have already begun some -- some are completed as we speak. You'll see that reflected in the 2020 guidance and we are absolutely driving toward not just a reduction of those cost as a percentage of revenue, but also a reduction in the absolute dollar amount, and we have plans in place to do that.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. Thank you very much for the time and best of luck.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Trey.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Trey Grooms","Good morning. So, I guess, I'm going to talk more -- or my first question is more around the volume. So, one, 4Q -- the 4Q volume, you did see a little bit of a deceleration there relative to what we saw in some of the other quarters. And then seeing the volume going from 7% or so, I guess that you put up 19% in aggregates to the guidance this year of 2% to 4%, it's my first question, can you talk more specifically about how we get there and what your end market expectations are, or your assumptions for your end markets, public, private, non-resi and residential, that you have baked into that.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, good morning. That's a good question. I'll just start off with a gentle reminder about the tough comp that we had year-over-year in fourth quarter, and then Tom can address some more specific comments. If we look at the fourth quarter of 2018 from the revenue perspective, it was just a really strong quarter. We had an 8% growth in volume, which led to a 24% in aggregates gross profit. So, I think with the volume increase of about 4% in the quarter this year, I mean, frankly, that's -- I think that's pretty decent growth. It's well within our guidance range that we set forward at the beginning of the year and coming off. So, very good fourth quarter we had last year, I'm not completely surprised by that.","Tom Hill","Yeah. I would add to that. The 2% to 4% growth in 2020, I think is our -- trying to be thoughtful about taking everything into account, demand, timing of shipments whether comparing it to 2019. So, remember that this -- that we saw a little bit slower starts and leading indicators on the private side and in the third quarter kind of July to October, that has now picked up and picked up dramatically. And it could flow through a part of 2020 as a short low or it could just -- what we're seeing right now to look through it, we just don't know quite know yet.","On the highway side, funding is up, demands is up. And public works for the first time, non-highway public works picking up. Still, there's quite a bit of unknowns about -- again about how fast DOTs can get jobs let and to work. The funding is there, but it has to be about timing, I think.","We are also not going to have -- as Suzanne said, we're not going to have a first quarter 2019. Last year we had a windfall, we were 13% as we had pulled forward from the prior year. And then 2019, we didn't have any hurricanes or tropical storms that impacted us in any material way. I think the 2% to 4% volume growth in our guidance is a thoughtful approach as we pull all those factors together. I would point out in all of this, that we will see growth in all four end markets and the one that's coming on, and we're pleased to see is that the non-highway infrastructure pieces is now rolling.","Trey Grooms","Got it. Okay. And Tom you mentioned the 1Q of 2019 having a pretty good showing there, with some windfalls. How should we be thinking -- and maybe this is for Suzanne, but how should we be thinking about the cadence there, the volume as we look into 2020 in light of things like tough comps and things of that nature?","Tom Hill","I think as always, it's going to be timing related. It'll be -- the -- we will have ebbs and flows with that, but the -- it will be timing of weather and timing of large projects.","Trey Grooms","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thomas of -- beg your pardon -- Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Kathryn.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Kathryn Thompson","Morning. Thanks for taking my questions today. First, focusing on Illinois, we are seeing a pick up the lettings in Illinois. I know you talked about lettings in the prepared commentary focusing on that. How do you expect forward you\u2019re seeing work, what type of projects and how big an impact could we build -- only have a state that has relatively underperformed over the past several years.","Tom Hill","I think, it's hard for me to hear you. What\u2019s your question -- first of all, how's it in Illinois? And then what would -- what should we expect from how it worked? What type of work?","Kathryn Thompson","Yeah. Really. What -- we've seen lettings, are you starting to see work come from rebuild only and what are your expectations for future volumes in the state from this FAST Act?","Tom Hill","So, I think that Illinois, I wouldn't -- we're not expecting a lot of that funding to flow through in 2020. I think it\u2019s weighted more 2021. We still have some of the toll work and airport work which will benefit us in Illinois in 2020. On the private side, in Illinois, it's probably not one of our strengths, is probably one of the few places we're probably seeing some weakness on that. So, while the team in Illinois did good job, improving unit margins, they're not getting the benefit of big volumes, and I don't think we are going to see the highway work in Illinois, much of it until 2021.","Am I answering your question?","Kathryn Thompson","Yeah. No, that's helpful. That's helpful. And then also just following up on the rail network. Assume that most the volumes are out of your South Georgia ops. Could you give us -- confirm just any more color in terms of type of projects that you're seeing, that are driving demand in the Gulf? Thank you.","Tom Hill","Yeah. So, it was -- in the fourth quarter, the rail work was really widespread, and it was really more timing. We're pleased with it. It's good work. It just comes at a higher cost. But it was across the board. I mean, it was Texas. It was the Mississippi, Louisiana\/assuming Panhandle, out -- South Alabama, even into Florida. We really just had -- just had a good solid fourth quarter and weather helped it.","Kathryn Thompson","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs Group. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Tom Hill","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering -- could you talk about the pricing cadence as we think about 2020 versus 2019, any differences in timing of price increases that we should keep in mind? And can you comment on how broad the price increases is in terms of breadth of markets as we think about 2020 versus what you put through 2019?","Tom Hill","Yeah. I would describe it is very similar -- 2020 will be very similar 2019. We're continuing to see solid price improvements at this point in 2020. We are very confident and guided that 4% to 6% price improvement for the year. Our bid work, our backlogs would support this, and our discussions with our fixed plant customers would support this kind of pricing momentum. Again -- and we\u2019ve always pointed this out, but we're doing again, it's really underpinned by that visibility of the rapidly growing highway work. And a solid -- we think a solid performance will be seen in growth in the private side.","And then again, now we're starting to see growth in the non-highway infrastructure. Whilst it's the smallest piece of it, it's healthy. And I would tell you that we're going to see price increases across. It's really widespread. It\u2019s across every one of our markets.","Suzanne Wood","As it was in 2019.","Tom Hill","Yeah.","Jerry Revich","And we will have -- if you hit -- the pricing guidance will have two straight years of 5% or so. Pricing gains, it's not sustainable in the medium term. And obviously, you're looking for a lower volume growth in 2010 than in 2019. I'm wondering as we think about the medium term outlook, how would you counsel us to think about sustainable level of long-term pricing gains.","Tom Hill","Obviously, we're not going to give guidance past 2020, but I -- you saw it in 2019, you're going to see it in 2020. I think the -- again, we've got long-term substantial highway funding coming and that visibility will continue to grow. So that just supports the kind of pricing we're singing. ","Jerry Revich","Okay. And lastly, in the past when you had pricing momentum in aggregates -- in your asphalt markets, you're able to achieve gross margin expansion. I could get a faster rate than we've seen so far in the cycle. Can you just comment on what's holding you back from achieving historical levels of gross margins in asphalt in this cycle compared to the past?","Tom Hill","Yeah, well, I think -- and as far as asphalt is concerned, we're guiding to not our product lines being up 10% to 15%. Asphalt prices and unit margins are going to drive the big improvement that asphalt. We would expect gross profit in asphalt to be up double-digit. That would be probably a slight improvement -- flat to a slight improvement in liquid costs. I think the good news is that the good highway work where we experienced the big funds and the timing of that line up with our asphalt business. So the story in asphalt I think is this is we said we -- all last year we would catch and bypass liquid prices, liquid cost to improve unit margins. You saw this happen in the fourth quarter, more to come.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Morning.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Tom, I think you mentioned being disappointed over the last couple months with regards to the speed with which some states are letting work. I was wondering if you just get a little more color on which states you're seeing this and maybe the magnitude of the delays, relative to what you were initially expecting.","Tom Hill","Yeah. I would describe it this way. I think at this point, where we are in the year right now, we would expect highway demand at this point be up, predict low single digit. Now that could move to mid single digit depending on the timing of large projects and really state's ability to get work let and get work started.","As I said earlier for asphalt, the good news is states where we have asphalt probably have the strongest demand going into 2020, Texas, California, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee. But if the flip side of that is places like Georgia and South Carolina, they struggled at the end of last year to get work -- to get fundings let and work started. If you look at Georgia, we are still shipping three mega projects in Georgia. So that's helping, but I would tell you that highway awards data starts have been a little slower, but then again lettings -- they do ebb and flow, they come and go. All that said, I think that single digit -- that low single digit could turn quickly to push us to mid single digit.","You got Georgia in the second half of 2019 where lettings were slow, now Georgia in the first half of 2020 is going to let $1 billion worth of work. Texas is looking to double their lettings going into 2021, that's already healthy. It's at $7.214 billion. California, we'd expect fund spending to up some 13%, embedded in that is a 25% increase in maintenance funding and that maintenance funding could go very fast. All-in-all, we'll experience growth in highways in 2020 and for years to come.","And as -- I will give you a reminder that highway starts right now while they've been maybe a little bit slower or 20% versus where they were two years ago. So, it's growing. It's just how fast in the states get it to work.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then in the release, I think you made some reference to concrete project delays. Can you talk about where you saw these project delays? And the magnitude and what do you expect this to kind of continue into 2020?","Tom Hill","Yeah. They -- we got delayed two places. It was timing of big projects in Virginia. And then it was both weather and fires in Northern California where we got hit with -- on the volume piece of this. I would expect volumes in concrete in 2020 up mid single digit and recovering in both those markets. I would expect prices up probably mid single digit and I would expect unit margins in concrete up double-digits.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Mike Dahl","Thanks for \u2026","Suzanne Wood","Morning.","Mike Dahl","Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I'm -- just to follow-up on one of the prior questions around the state lettings. What's your sense of just the underlying fundamental cause for the slower pace of lettings? Is it a -- is it a worker shortage, is it -- something in terms of the just getting things through the regulatory bodies, just a little more color on the underlying root cause there?","Tom Hill","Yeah. I don't think it's external factors outside of the DOTs. It's really them being able to -- they got huge slug of funding, they got to mature into that and then they are going to have -- you got to get it estimated, permitted, let -- you got engineering that goes into this, a lot work for those DOTs, put projects out, while everybody has the pressures of workers and employment at -- this is not what's holding up the lettings, it is just -- it\u2019s holding up the states, it\u2019s just their ability to get that work planned and out and let and put to work.","Suzanne Wood","Particularly as some of the projects are larger than they had been in the past. The larger the project that just adds a degree of complexity to the process.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Thanks. Second question, just thinking about the incremental margins, if I look at 2019 and on the whole, the difference if my math is right in terms of the incremental margin and what you would target on as 60% would be about $60 million in EBITDA and so understand some of the one time issues or transitory issues that you've been talking about. But it's pretty big number and this is in a year where you had everything kind of working for you in terms of volume price and your internal initiatives.","So, as we go into 20, I guess what I'm getting at is really just -- what's giving you the level of confidence that you can get back to the 60%? Is it actually -- volume was too hot in 2019? And so it gives you go into 2020, the stripping costs aren't as high or just trying to understand that bridge little.","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. I will comment first and then I'm sure Tom will have a follow-up comment. I'm -- I can't say I'm quite sure about your math on the $60 million, but with respect to the 60% that is -- we say this often that is a long-term average, you're going to have some quarters and some years when you hit it some quarters, you're below it. We have had a couple of years where we were just above that. In fact, if you just look at 2019 for the trailing 12-month period ended in September we were right at 60%. So I think when you look at the flow through for this year it really does revolve around those three items that Tom called out, had it not been for those we would have been much closer to that number. And some of those were timing and mix related and to the extent it\u2019s timing and mix related, you won't have that pressure into 2020.","Tom Hill","Yeah, I think, fundamentally, this is not an inflationary issue. It's more about timing. We talked about the remote distribution, that's a good -- that's really good, because it's more volume for us. The fill work will come in 2020. As far as what we did in Q3 and Q4 was stripping and preventive maintenance. I think those are just got that operating disciplines. First of all, the stripping is an investment and in pits. While it's cost -- it's a one time thing for a while as you develop pits and get ready for future volumes which we think are going to grow.","On the maintenance side, it's really about -- we want to control our equipment, don't have the equipment control you and make sure you do in a timely manner. Let me just give you like a real life example of that. If you were to take a seven-foot cone crusher down, due to oil samples, it cost you $50,000. If you wait till it failed, it cost you $150,000 and that's just the tip of the iceberg cost because now you're taking the plant down which is very expensive. And if you look at underneath that where we are from really important metrics like tons per hour to a plant downtime or tons per man hour, you are seeing improvement.","It's an investment. We started February with investment in our people operations -- through this operational excellence program, allows us to maximize the long-term efficiency of operations. And I\u2019d tell you that I'm confidence that these efforts will improve our profitability of the company. And I think we our folks have taken those into account as they created their plan and their guidance for 2020.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Seth of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Rohit Seth","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on if resident -- if residential construction grew faster than you expected in 2020, would there be any ASP or mixed benefits or maybe on the cost side?","Tom Hill","No, I think it would you -- residential has a good mix of both base and clean stone. I think it would flow through like everything else. Although -- and that is something we'd love to see. So, we got our fingers crossed, but I wouldn't expect any big price mix change or unit margins mix change.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And then on your incremental margins, just kind of building on some of the things you've already said, but last three years, it's come under the 60%. I'm curious how much of equipment failure has been part of that issue?","Tom Hill","Well, I think as we do that -- we talked about same-store and same-store in 2018 finished 65%. 2019 was -- so we have years that are up, we have years below. I think as you look at it -- and I would point out to you the same-store -- and you could have times when it's higher, you're going to have times when it\u2019s lower, will guide you back to the 60%.","Rohit Seth","Right.","Suzanne Wood","The other thing -- I'm sorry, I was just going to add. I think the other thing for us is -- the real question is we look through some of these fourth quarter cost is, is there something there that is indicative of a significant shift in the cost performance of the company, is something going on there that has materially changed the cost structure of the company. And that to me would be the real important sort of carry forward question into 2020. And again, as we go back through those items, our view internally as we've talked a lot about them is, no that there isn't something that is a significant change in the cost structure of the company. And for that reason, even though there can be some volatility in it between quarters or years, we, on the long-term basis, guide back to a trailing 12 of 60%.","Rohit Seth","Understood. And then on the M&A pipeline, can you provide any thoughts and what you're seeing out there and maybe your appetite.","Tom Hill","Yeah. As always we've some projects both large and small that we're working. Again, as we always tell you its discipline. Everything does not fit us. It's got to be unique to have synergies for us, have the discipline that if it's too expensive won't be able to walk away from it. And really importantly is once you get it, make sure you integrate it very fast and very accurately. So, we've got a number of them working. We'll just -- again all of them don't fit us, so we'll be picky about what we buy. ","Rohit Seth","Any deals of size out there? ","Tom Hill","There are -- it's both. It's both -- some large ones and some small ones. I don't think there's any mega ones out there, but I would -- this full gambit.","Rohit Seth","Understood. All right. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, Michael.","Michael Wood","I was hoping you could quantify the repair and maintenance a little bit more. Curious if you could tell us how much it is as a percentage of COGS? And should we think about this is a purely variable next year in terms of increasing alongside volume, or could it maybe decline after being elevated this year?","Tom Hill","I think what -- we would guide you to that -- this is that I think you may see a little bit more of this in the first few months of the year. And then, I would expect it to level off to meet the guidance that we've given you. And I would call that out is both some stripping and some repair and maintenance, but I think we're confident as we look at our hand for the full year guidance of how that flows through -- our cost flows through for the year.","Michael Wood","Okay. In 2019, I know you were talking about throughout the year -- earlier in the year, some lower mixed ongoing on to the larger highway projects. I'm curious if you can give us an update on that? Is that continued, or you seeing kind of mix up as those projects mature?","Tom Hill","I think what we saw in -- the mix that we saw in the quarter was a little bit of geographic and a little bit of product mix. As we called out, I think was that for the year our performance was right in line with guidance. The full year was 5.5, mix adjusted 4.8, and it was in the impact of asphalt size is it really driven by highway work. Geographic mix, a little bit higher volumes on the Gulf Coast and the Southeast.","Michael Wood","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Hi, guys.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Phil Ng","Good morning. Appreciating that there are some delayed lettings and potentially some downdraft from private, couple of tougher comps. Would be helpful, Tom, if you give us some color how to think about the shape of the year from a growth standpoint?","Tom Hill","Yeah. Good question. I would expect -- first of all, you have got a really tough comp in Q1, because volumes last year were up 13% and it was really that you had the pull forward from 2018 into 2019. And other than that I would call it one of timing of large projects and timing of weather and we also had a very -- the weather in the first quarter of last year was -- with exception of California was quite good. So -- and you guys can look outside and see what's happening right now with the weather in first quarter this year. So, all-in-all, I think it's timing of weather in large projects.","Phil Ng","And Tom, you're not calling for any delay of larger project at this juncture, which would you can't predict at this juncture, if I'm interpreting your kind of ...?","Tom Hill","Yeah. So -- yeah, we're shipping a lot of big projects right now. We called out three in Georgia. We've got a number of different places. I believe it's going to be how fast the highways can get the jobs let and to work.","Phil Ng","Okay.","Tom Hill","And we talked about that a little bit where there was fast and we were slow what we call it out with Georgia and South Carolina, which slot. The second half of last year's lettings which flow into 2020 and slow, but the first half of this year they've got huge letting. So, we'll see -- how fast the work get started.","Phil Ng","Got it. And then based on your guidance for your downstream business for 2020, it's a touch below what you thought actually, coming into 2019 initially, just given some of the project delays you saw last year and frankly a more manageable liquid asphalt price environment. I'm little surprised you're not expecting more strength. Can you give us some of the puts and takes?","Tom Hill","Yeah. I think what we see is real strength in unit margin improvement in asphalt and up double-digit. We're calling for liquid being flat to slightly down. And our volumes are just up slightly. And the -- that again will be determined by the timing of this DOT work and how fast it gets started.","You got to remember we had two -- we had big projects in asphalt in Tennessee and we had the big 202 project in Arizona, which neither one of those were repeating going into 2020. So, they were windfalls in 2019, they are not going to repeat, even with that we're seeing slight improvements in volume and so that get much bigger -- they'll have to accelerate work is in some of the lettings that I talked about.","Phil Ng","Got it.","Tom Hill","The thing I'm encouraged about -- I said in asphalt is -- you saw those margins turn in the fourth quarter, we have been predicting that kind of chasing that through the year 2019, now we see -- we carry that momentum into 2020.","Phil Ng","And just one cleanup question, Tom. When you said flat to down liquid costs, are you calling sequentially or is that more on a year-over-year on \u2026?","Tom Hill","But I think -- importantly with that we're going to manage what -- a number of what happens the last fall, we're going to manage that unit margin in asphalt appropriately. So, the liquid prices fall, we'll see that accretive to unit margins. And like I said the good news is -- we call it and keep growing it and I think we'll see that as we continue to perform in 2020.","Phil Ng","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Seldon Clarke","Hi. Thanks for the question.","Tom Hill","Sure.","Seldon Clarke","Could you just give us a sense of how the margin differs on your shipments by rail? Is this a dynamic that's coming solely from higher demand in these particular areas, or has the cost of service provided by the rails change with some of the ongoing initiatives that they've been putting into place?","Tom Hill","Okay. I would point out this way. In general, the rail tons is just going to be a little lower margins where -- and that's -- and higher price, higher costs, a little bit lower margins, but very good margins. So, it's good work. I mean, the volume being up is a good thing. I would point out that in contrast, the blue water tonnage is much higher margins, it would be higher price, higher cost and higher margins than the whole. So --- and what we saw in the quarter was just a timing of good work along the rail that happened to ship at a higher rate.","Seldon Clarke","Okay. So, nothing to do with them putting process rail in place. Okay.","Tom Hill","No.","Suzanne Wood","No.","Tom Hill","A simple thing with quarry cost versus rail distribution, you have rail distribution plus the quarry costs which just comes at a higher price and a higher cost.","Seldon Clarke","Got it. Okay. And then just a question on the 2020 guidance, there is about 700 basis points of differential in the high and low end as it relates to the year in your growth. Could you just give us a sense of maybe what's embedded in the low end of guidance, and what would you really need to see to hit the higher end of that range?","Tom Hill","I think -- I would tell you is probably going to be mostly volume. I go back to timing of shipments, I go back to do we get -- do you get hit with the tropical storm or two or three. Those would be the big variables, so I think between the high end and the low end and how it lines up would be the delta.","Suzanne Wood","That's right. And that's a very similar approach to what we took at the beginning of 2019 when we gave the volume guidance then, a range of 3% to 5%. And luckily and happily we wound up being ahead of that for the year. But Tom is right, it really comes down to what happens with the timing, it's shipments and weather as to whether you're at the lower end or the higher end. And as Tom said, we'll continue to watch with interest how residential -- how those starts, continue to improve throughout the year.","Seldon Clarke","All right. Thanks for the time.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Garik Shmois","Hi. Thanks. Just one more ...","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Garik Shmois","Hey, good morning. So, just wanted to follow-up just on the highway outlook, just being an election year with the FAST Act expiring in the fall. Do you think that could lead to additional letting delays in 2020? Just curious how these factors might play into the highway outlook and some of the sluggishness that you can see?","Tom Hill","Yeah. We talked about the cadence and highway lettings, and some that they have been slow and now coming on strong and the timing of it, I wouldn't think the election year would have any impact on state DOT lettings and the least I don't think it's going to have -- it won't -- for sure will have any an impact on the FAST Act or funding from the Feds. I think people in Washington are working hard towards the highway bill, a lot of progress made on that both on the build side and the funding. I don't expect to get a highway bill in 2020. At the same time, when the FAST Act expires, I don't expect any of that funding to go down, we'll just do an extension. So, I don't see a big impact on it. I don't see any impact on state DOT lettings due to this being election year.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. And then, just given some of the repair and maintenance costs here and some of the other items that you called out, is this all -- just to be clear within your plan as you think about your $2 billion EBITDA target you laid out your Investor Day and thinking about how that could be potentially achievable once you reach 230 million to 240 million tons of volume.","Tom Hill","Yeah. If anything -- I think the four strategic initiatives, including the operations excellence initiative are giving me more and more confidence in our ability to get to the $9 that we planned. I think that our operator -- if you look -- if you were to look beneath the surface in our operations, while the headline is higher stripping and repair and maintenance costs. Behind that, I think you're doing the right things in the investing in the business for the long-term. Really importantly though is you're starting to see the key operating parameters which we measure things like tons per hour throughput through individual plants, downtime individual plants, tons per man hour individual plants, we're starting to see improvement. I think we are teaching our young people the right things to do. We are leveraging the collective knowledge and experience of Vulcan across 350 plants.","So, while we see some headline things, the ultimate work that goes into this from those initiatives is starting to gel. The commercial excellence initiatives is mature. It is working, and we're very pleased with our progress there.","Garik Shmois","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","David MacGregor","Good morning. Just getting back to the 2% to 4% volume guide, and just a question I guess on construction capacity and if we get a large increase in awards and lettings. What are the downstream bottlenecks that most concern use or constraint to your volume growth? And how you accounted for that as potentially conservative element within your guidance?","Tom Hill","Well, first of all, for Vulcan internally, I don't think we see any bottlenecks we can handle it. We love to see it grow as much as it could, and we will be there both from an aggregate prospective and asphalt prospective or concrete perspective.","On -- as far as if lettings were to increase dramatically, I think what you see is the work would happen. The big bottleneck as always the people ask about is labor and all the labor shortages, to answer that question is, yes. I don't think it's going to hold up work, but I think it will hold up is ability to catch up once work is delayed. So, if you had a month in the wintertime, which was all rain and really cold trying to catch that up or if you had a big tropical storm come through, it's going to take you a little longer to catch it up just because they don't have the firepower to do it fast. That's how I would describe it.","David MacGregor","Okay. Have you factored that in your guidance? Is that -- there is an element potentially the discrepancy between 2% to 4%, which seems fairly conservative versus the story, which seems pretty bullish?","Tom Hill","I think that -- I think when it comes to volume, as I've said we tried to pull all of those factors and as comparing last year the pull through, the weather aspect of it, a little bit of a air pocket and leading indicators in the rail side and the timings of highway lettings and state's ability to get that work and when we pull all that together and the upside potential, the risk piece of it, that's what we got -- we try to be thoughtful about the 2% to 4%.","David MacGregor","Yeah. That makes sense. And then second question on mix. And if you could talk about the pace of growth in your backlog. And is as your backlog building faster in your higher margin products and geographies?","Tom Hill","I think -- I would describe this. I think when we looked at the 4% to 6% is best we can. If you take the mix of products of -- when I say mix both geographic and product mix together. I think we have seen good improvement in base in our backlogs. We've seen good improvement in clean stone in our backlogs and our booking pace right now as we look at it both in price and in volume will support our guidance.","David MacGregor","Thank you very much.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning, guys. What did shock you if EBITDA was flat to down in Q1?","Tom Hill","Well, we -- we can't give Q1 guidance. I think as we said we are comping over a year in the first quarter of 2019 with -- which was very good weather and we had the windfall of pull forward of 13% volume from the year before. I don't think you'll see that pull through. You guys can look outside, know what the weather is doing in the fourth -- in the first quarter. So, again, we're halfway through it, we'll just have to wait and see.","Adam Thalhimer","And then Tom, can you walk us through the demand you're seeing right now in California and Texas?","Tom Hill","Sure. I would describe California this way, I think that the -- well, let me start with Texas. The public side is very strong. The TxDOT has done an excellent job of lettings and getting work out. There is big work -- there is shipping right now, there's big work on the horizon. And as we said next year they're going to go from a wow factor of $7 billion to $14 billion.","On the private side, I would describe North Texas is being driven by non-res. I'd say res is fairly flat with some exceptions, some big development North Fort Worth. South Texas housing strong, non-res, a little bit soft. Coastal Texas everything strong. And you could see some LNG work start on Coastal Texas in the second half of 2020, a little bit going now.","California, Northern Cal public is very strong both for aggregates and asphalt. Private side looks good, maybe a bit flat in the Bay. Non-res is a bit soft, but leading indicators were improving. Publics on Southern California, again public very strong, highway strong, non-highway is strong. On single private -- in Southern California, probably a little bit of a watch for us with leading indicators a bit, were a bit softer in the last three months of indicators, were up over 20%.","So, all-in-all, I think pretty healthy growth in both states. And I would tell you that I would expect good margin improvements -- unit margin improvements in both locations, both in aggregates and in asphalt.","Adam Thalhimer","Good color. Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Adrian Huerta","Hi, good morning everyone and thank you for taking my call, Tom and Suzanne.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Adrian Huerta","Good morning. Quick question on cash taxes -- can you tell us how they ended last year. I believe they probably ended way below what you were expecting early last year. And right now you're back into expecting $200 million. If there is any chances that there could be lower than your guidance?","Suzanne Wood","Sure. And the main reason for the reduction in cash taxes through the year was that as we started the year. We have not made a determination as to whether we were going to take advantage of the bonus depreciation or not that's a calculation that we have to go through each year because there is some interplay between it and depletion allowance that we get, when we file our tax returns as well as some other things.","So, there is an actual -- while it might seem obvious, you would want to take advantage of the bonus depreciation there is actually a calculation that you need to go to ensure you are selecting the calculation methodology that gives you the most tax benefit. So, we started out the year under one assumption. We determined in the second quarter and called this out at the time that we were indeed going to take the bonus depreciation, that resulted in for 2019 us paying quite a bit less tax than we had initially intended and the estimated -- the cash tax rate was between 7% and 8%.","As we start off in 2020, we are guiding to an effective tax rate of 20%, we will go through the same process again and make a determination as to what depreciation methodology we're going to use. So, there is some chance the cash tax may be lower. But we will -- we'll work through that process in a similar fashion that we use this year. Even under the -- even under the assumption of having higher cash taxes in 2020 as compared to 2019, I just point out, we still would throw off about $800 million of discretionary cash flow. So very healthy, very substantial and that $800 million could be put on a discretionary basis toward growth projects, potentially M&A, if something comes along that meets all the criteria that Tom outlined, your dividends and share repurchases.","Adrian Huerta","That was very clear, Suzanne. And if I may ask another question. Can you share with us any details on the quarry that is expected to open in California in terms of when and the size and potential volumes on an annual basis that that quarry could take?","Tom Hill","Yeah. So it's, in Frisco, we're not -- it probably won't open until beginning of next year -- first or second quarter of next year. Size, we're not going to actually disclose that at this point. We have a closer to -- we will talk about those things. It's been a very good market. It was taken us some 10 plus years to get this done. The team has worked very hard, and now they're working hard to build it out into a market that is -- it is very healthy and quite profitable.","Adrian Huerta","Excellent, Tom. So, it's totally new market for you?","Tom Hill","No, it's a market we've been in before.","Adrian Huerta","Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much Tom and Suzanne. I appreciate it.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Chabran of On Field Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Chabran","Hello, everyone. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. First of all, concerning the rail deliveries, I think you talked about that extensively already so and my apologies you already answered. But how should we think about it for 2020 the evolution of rail deliveries. Is there any chance that it could impact your margins as it did in Q4 2019?","Tom Hill","I'm sorry. The beginning of your question -- I'm sorry, beginning of your question I couldn't hear.","Paul Chabran","I'm sorry. The question was related to the evolution of rail deliveries in 2020. How should we think about that, does change -- they could impact your margin as it did in Q4 2019?","Suzanne Wood","The repairs and maintenance, is that what you're asking about -- the connection was a little poor -- I just couldn't hear. I'm sorry.","Paul Chabran","Yeah. Apologies. It's concerning the rail deliveries. They don't defense rail deliveries that had an impact on your margin in Q4?","Tom Hill","I wouldn't expect -- the rail happen to be a timing issue of big shipments in the fourth quarter. And I would not expect -- I think we've got those -- the volumes that we do out of those that rail distribution network embedded in our 2020 guidance, and I would see very little impact.","Paul Chabran","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Brent Thielman","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to -- for I think for you, Suzanne, just on the SAG expense, can you help us understand the sensitivity to growth this year. In other words, if things are going to lineup well, through the year, you start seeing 5%, 6%, 7% volume growth, can we sustain SAG below 2019 level?","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. I think we can. As I said, this is a matter of what's driving that cost reduction year-over-year or the changes we talked about. Some of that is being more efficient in the way we do things. So, it's not like -- it's a variable kind of expense. It's more what I would call on the fixed side that we are making some changes and so, I think that that would be sustainable, yes.","Brent Thielman","Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Michael Dudas","Good -- I think afternoon. I think you may have gone into 12 o'clock. So, in light of that you've been very good job in answering and being very descriptive. So, all of my questions have been answered. Appreciate it. Thank you. Good luck.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Well, thank you for your interest and support to Vulcan Materials.

My name is Tabitha and I'll be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark D. Warren - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tabitha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.","Please note a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the company's website.","Before we begin with actual results and projections, I refer you to slide two of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. At Vulcan, we posted another strong quarter, and we remain on track to have a very good year. Our solid performance, continued revenue growth and margin expansion are a direct result of the great efforts of our people. Today, you're going to hear about steady recovery, solid price improvement and about our sharp focus on the things we can control.","Now, we won't be giving guidance for 2016 in today's call, but as we begin our planning cycle for the next year, our fundamental trajectory remains intact. We continue to experience a gradual, steady recovery in demand and shipments, although the details, of course, vary from market to market. We also continue to see a positive pricing climate with appropriate increases either announced or planned for next year. We remain well positioned to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at an impressive click.","We're excited about the opportunities ahead. Our people know that they must remain highly focused on margin improvement and continue to drive ongoing improvements in our business. We're focused on capitalizing on our momentum. Our people are engaged and entrepreneurial and they are sharing best practices across the organization. They know that they are empowered to serve our customers and keep making our company more profitable and better in every way. We also, all of us, remain highly focused on safe operations protecting the health and safety of our employees at all times.","Now to company specifics. The recovery in construction activity continued across most of our markets. As we will show you, the metrics are certainly trending in the right direction. While demand is recovering gradually to more normal levels, we've enjoyed sustained margin expansion and we continue to grow our profitability in a disciplined manner. As construction activity and materials demand continue to pick up, we're also seeing improving confidence in pricing.","Now, we've had some cost increases during the last two quarters. Even though some of this is expected given volume growth, we are very focused on continually improving our operating performance. These efforts began to pay off in September, when we saw marked improvements in our costs. We are going to stay very focused on this. Our employees are doing a really good job turning incremental revenues into incremental profits. And let me add, we see these trends continuing. We are heading into 2016 with the wind at our back. That said, we are totally focused on finishing this year strong.","Now, let's talk about the third quarter. Demand continued to recover gradually in the quarter. Our results demonstrated the earnings leverage in our business model. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continued to expand. As you can see on slide four, a 19% increase in total revenues converted to a 39% increase in gross profit. This also drove a 47% increase in adjusted EBIT, and a 31% increase in adjusted EBITDA.","Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95 per diluted share and an increase of $0.41 from the prior year. Gross profit margins increased by 490 basis points and were supported by pricing momentum. We enjoyed strong earnings growth in Aggregates as well as in our Asphalt and Concrete segments.","We continue to manage and leverage SAG. SAG costs did increase in absolute terms. Here, one-time items offset lower head count related costs. What's important is as a percent of sales, SAG is trending towards 8% for the year, down about 1% from the prior year. All in all, I am very pleased with our peoples' performance, whether measured by margin percentage or per unit profit, our profitability continue to improve very significantly.","Now, let's take a look at our shipments across the U.S. The map on slide five shows a breakdown of our growth in shipments of Aggregates on a same-store basis across the country. In the quarter, we saw solid demand growth, even though many customers faced bottlenecks impeding shipments. It's important to recognize what a good job our local teams are doing working with our customers to meet rising demand effectively and efficiently.","Momentum continued with solid growth in key states; shipments in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana each grew by 10% or more. In contrast to the majority of our markets which were up, Illinois was down about 10%. This was due to significant large project work completed in 2014. Now at the same time, California saw healthy growth in the third quarter as major projects kicked off after being delayed in the first half of the year.","I'd like to turn your attention to slide six, which shows our year-over-year growth in shipments. As you can see, this is very similar pattern to the last slide, with solid year-to-date growth in Aggregates shipments of 10% in total or 7% on a same-store basis. Both our East and West Coast markets continued to enjoy healthy growth as did Texas. Shipments in the Gulf Coast markets were also strong, with the exception of the central Gulf Coast region.","Turning to slide seven, you can see that our pricing continues to strengthen, and for the quarter, it improved in line with our expectations, up 8% over the prior year's quarter. In a number of markets, we saw year-over-year freight adjusted price improvements in excess of 10%. These increases were fairly broad-based and occurred across all product types. And in more than half of our markets, we had price increases, ranging from $0.60 to $1.20 per ton.","For the quarter, we didn't see this level of price increases in Virginia, South Carolina and Arizona because we had much larger shipments of base material and fines on new construction and large projects. As discussed before, volume in base and fines can detract from price, but it improves overall profitability. Let me emphasize the fact that pricing momentum will continue for us.","There are three primary reasons that the pricing climate should remain positive. One, customer confidence continues to improve. Two, increasing demand builds backlogs. And third, construction related businesses are increasingly focused on earning adequate returns. Effective pricing performance remains a key focus for our management teams across our footprint. We are focused on delivering value to customers, while earning a good return on the significant investments that we make on their behalf.","This ties directly to providing excellent service to our customers \u2013 the right product, the right quality, the right time and being paid the right price for superior service and value.","Now, we've talked a lot on past calls about the three profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits. That's because it's important. As a reminder, the three profit drivers are sales and production mix, price and operating efficiencies. We call these the three circles.","As you can see on slide eight, our third quarter and trailing 12 month, gross profit per ton increased 23% and 25%, respectively. So in the quarter on a same-store basis, price was up $0.86 per ton and gross profit margin was up $0.90 per ton. Our sales and operations people are doing a superior job turning demand growth into higher profitability. Our local teams continued to do an outstanding job managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product mix. This is something we will stay focused on every day. With respect to the three circles, we've talked about the positive pricing environment and we've talked about new construction improving the impact of product mix on profitability.","Regarding the third circle, operating efficiencies and leverage. We continue to emphasize production planning and operating efficiencies across the business. Despite improvements in unit profitability and same-store costs, we have seen some areas of rising costs. As I mentioned, I'm not satisfied with this and neither are our people. Still, we've seen some costs rise; about two-thirds of these increases resulted from geographic mix and fringe benefits often outside our control. In addition, during the last two quarters, we have begun to see a trend of rising repair and maintenance and labor costs in some areas. Even though this isn't surprising, we are not going to accept it.","Growing volumes are requiring us to run operations longer, resulting in more repairs and higher than budgeted spending on parts and supplies. And labor costs in some areas were up in the first eight months of the year. We saw costs go up, we focused on them, and we realized improvements in September. We will continue to manage these costs very carefully.","Let's turn to slide nine. Our employees can be very proud of this chart. It clearly shows that our people are highly focused on continuous improvement and quality of earnings. We're excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion. We have now seen nine consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin and we'll continue to post improvements.","Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply. We are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume. Again, I would expect this trend to continue into 2016.","Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in the Aggregates segment. This underpins the margin improvement you saw on the previous slide. Our incremental gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $60 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $83 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted mainly by higher costs at acquired operations as we bring them up to our standards and by higher costs for repair and maintenance.","Now, since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For this time period, incremental gross profit margin was 73%. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $177 million on incremental revenues of $242 million, adjusted for the same acquisitions.","On a trailing 12-months basis, the flow through rate was consistently \u2013 has consistently exceeded the company's stated goal of 60% since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013. Given our strategic focus on the Aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with slide 11, and as we did last quarter, use it to recap many of the trends Tom just reviewed. On this slide, we highlight the improved profitability of our Aggregates segment, both in total gross profit dollars and on a per ton basis, since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013.","On the left hand side of the chart, you see that for the trailing 12 months just ended, we shipped 175 million tons, 35 million tons more than for the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013, just before the recovery began. Now, looking to the right hand side of the chart, you see that Aggregates segment gross profit for the 12 months just ended was $682 million or $324 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began.","So, on 35 million of incremental Aggregates' tons shipped so far in the recovery, we've delivered $324 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.35 or 53%, and a 25% increase in shipments has been converted into a 90% increase in segment gross profit.","These facts, we believe, illustrate the impact of the continuous, compounding performance improvements you heard Tom reference, and that in many ways characterize our current Aggregates centric strategy and execution focus.","Now turning to slide 12, which shows the solid performance of our Asphalt and Concrete businesses for the third quarter. Segment gross profit and unit profitability in each of these segments increased significantly versus the prior year, and year-to-date the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan.","Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was $30 million, a year-over-year improvement of $15 million driven by improving same-store volumes, strong cost disciplines and margin management, as well as the impact of acquired operations.","As a reminder, our acquisition and swap activities have added 19 Asphalt plants to our portfolio since the second half of last year. On a the same-store basis, Asphalt volumes grew 20%, in part due to work deferred from the first half of the year, and Asphalt gross profit grew $11 million. Vulcan is among the five largest producers of asphalt in the country and these operations complement our Aggregates operations very well.","Third quarter Concrete gross profit was approximately $10 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter \u2013 in the prior year. Margins in this business segment have benefited from divestitures and other actions to focus our portfolio. The operations we have divested lost $2 million at the gross profit line in the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, Concrete volumes were flat versus the prior year and gross profit improved by $3 million.","I'll now wrap up with slide 13 and a recap of our full year 2015 outlook, before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks. In short, our outlook for the full year remains largely consistent with that presented in our second quarter call, and we are reaffirming our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $775 million to $825 million.","As usual, we note that weather patterns can impact results in the fourth quarter significantly, particularly if they shorten the total construction season. But, and as you've seen earlier in this call, the business is performing well and it is performing as expected.","Now, ticking through a few of the individual drivers. We currently expect full year volumes of approximately $177 million tons, up 9% year-on-year in total and 7% on a same-store basis. As noted earlier, we see the gradual recovery and demand continuing across most of our markets. However, capacity constraints at various points in the construction chain \u2013 for example, the availability of skilled construction labor in certain markets \u2013 have made it difficult for many of our customers to catch up fully on work deferred due to rain in the first half of the year. And the continued uncertainty regarding federal highway legislation has begun to impact timing of certain road projects on the margin.","With respect to pricing, we expect the currently positive environment to persist. And we currently expect to finish 2015 with a year-on-year increase in average freight adjusted selling prices of approximately 7%. As we'd indicated, pricing momentum in the second half of the year has been stronger than in the first half of the year.","Our Asphalt and Concrete segments have performed ahead of plan, both on a same-store basis and as a result of moves we've made to strengthen our portfolio. These segments should generate full-year gross profit of approximately $95 million. But again, please note that fourth quarter weather patterns can significantly impact actual results.","SAG remains roughly in line with plan and declining as a percent of sales. Importantly, direct salary and wage costs for SAG head count have remained flat this year. And we do not expect the rise in the pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that we've had this year to reoccur next year.","Core capital spending, excluding dollars committed to the purchase of new ships to service our Yucat\u00e1n quarry, remains in line with plan. As noted in our earnings release, we may elect to pull some spending forward from 2016 in order to capitalize on certain procurement opportunities.","As has been our practice, we plan to issue guidance for our 2016 year during our February earnings call. And certainly a number of the things can change between now and then, including federal highway legislation which Tom will touch on in a moment. But as we sit here in early November, we see volume and pricing trends similar to those we've seen year-to-date continuing through the fourth quarter and into next year.","And we, of course, remained intently focused on converting that top line revenue growth into cash flow and earnings growth, to the very best of our ability. As Tom, said at the beginning of the call our basic trajectory remains intact. Tom, back to you.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John. Our employees are working hard to ensure our strong performance, continue revenue growth and margin expansion. I can't say enough good things about our people. They never quit, always try to do things better and have enormous pride in what they do; and I see this every day.","Our priority is continuous improvement. We're going to stay very focused on the things that we can control \u2013 on keeping our people safe, on customer service, on controlling cost and on price. We'll get fair value for the major investments we make in this business. I can tell you, it's all about creating value for our customers and our company.","Now, before I conclude, I'd like to say a few things about the highway bill. I reported in our last call about the significant progress in Washington towards a new bill. The Senate, with great leadership, did its job when it passed a new six-year bill, the DRIVE Act, on July 30. The House transportation and infrastructure committee marked up its version of the highway bill two weeks ago.","Congressional leaders believe it may be possible to compress the two bills and pass the final highway bill before the end of November. We are encouraged by the bipartisan progress that is occurring in Congress to address America's infrastructure challenges. We have been very engaged in efforts to encourage Congress to step up to this challenge. A new multi-year highway bill will be a step in the right direction and our nation's leaders will need to take additional big steps in the years to come. This is important for our country, our industry and for Vulcan.","In closing, I truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Looking forward to the rest of 2015 and into 2016, I want you to know that we are very energized and engaged. We are focused on the fundamentals, on finding new ways to grow our company and its profitability every day.","Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of Ted Grace of Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you, gentlemen.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, Tom, I hate to lead off on a question on 2016 given your opening comments. And so, I won't ask specifically for guidance, but just as it relates to maybe the slope of that trajectory heading into next year, it seems like depending on whether 4Q probably comes in a little bit below plan given some of the commentary; obviously one of your large peers gave some guidance that people are interpreting as off-trend growth. And so, I'm just wondering if you could give any kind of hand holding, whether it's market related expectations on how people should think about that slope. I know John just said basic trajectory intact, but any way you could kind of frame out, anything would be helpful, if we could start there?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start with demand. We're seeing demand growth in all of our major markets \u2013 the vast majority of them \u2013 and in the market segments. More than half of our markets in the third quarter saw double-digit growth, a little bit of lagging as we talked about with Alabama, Mississippi, kind of the center of the country. But overall, we continue to see healthy demand growth, whether that's across geographies or market segments. So, we don't see anything that would give us pause for slowdown, whether in the fourth quarter or afterwards. Now, if you look at \u2013 on the same thing on price \u2013 we continue to see very healthy climate for price increases. That's built by customer confidence and by rising demand.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, that's super helpful. And then maybe if I can just quickly tuck one in on costs. I know you talked about being somewhat above expectations in the last couple of quarters. You mentioned some of the factors in the third quarter, including more recently, labor and R&M ticking up, taking some proactive action to address that. Just when we think about the normal framework of incrementals you've talked about, is there any tweaking we should think about in kind of the next one or two years that could affect that to any meaningful degree or is that still kind of a useful framework as we think about just normalized flow through rates?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ted, I don't see anything that would change the fundamentals of our earnings leverage or our trajectory \u2013 just \u2013 it's not there. And I'll address the third quarter; our costs in the third quarter year-over-year on a same-store basis were down about a nickel. Built in that was diesel was down about $0.23. The increase occurred in fringes and geographic mix was about two-thirds of it, which geographic mix is usually remote distribution network or higher cost markets. That will always \u2013 fixes itself \u2013 so that will come back around. The fringes are one-time or won't last.","The other piece of that was R&M, which is natural for this time of the cycle. And then in some areas, we had labor costs that some \u2013 that were up in the second quarter and the third quarter \u2013 we recognized those. I think our folks did a good job of addressing those and we saw marked improvement in cost overall in September.","So it's \u2013 what's important here is that we focus on the things that we can control. It's imperative that we always try to improve that. And it's that compounding effort of every day in every quarry of making it better and compounding those earnings.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","So, Ted, I think if you just checked through each of those three big drivers of costs, none of them are really structural in our view. One is geographic mix, shipping from higher cost locations or markets, and frankly, that comes typically with higher priced and higher margin markets as well. So, that as Tom said, correct itself and that's not a bad thing.","On fringes and those employee benefit related cost, most of that, including the pension accounting issues, we don't see repeating next year and we'll correct for. And then, I think, Tom gave you a clear explanation for how we've addressed to some degree already, some of the somewhat temporary headwinds we think we've seen in repair and maintenance cost and labor cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions today. I think that you helped to answer some of the questions I had about the higher costs, which were more one-time in nature versus embedded cost on a go forward basis. Just to clean up that question that you had \u2013 the answer that you were just giving in the previous queue. How far along are you in terms of resolving some of those costs that \u2013 I know you said you made progress in September \u2013 but is this something realistically it will be more of a Q1 before you really kind of fully cleaned up? Or will there just be some residual, particularly from a geographic mix, that we see lingering in Q4?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me give you an example of labor. I think we got ahead of ourselves in a few markets on labor, where we thought volume's going to come back faster than it did. We hired too many people and actually we had to go correct it when we saw it wasn't going to happen. We also \u2013 we're running in a number of the places \u2013 we're running, say, four plants with two crews and we've made some structural scheduling mistakes there, which we corrected. So a lot of this, I think, we've taken really good steps to recognize the problems, why we have good metrics and our folks look at it really hard and they've corrected it. And then as far as the geographic mix that will come and go, I don't see anything structural to that. You'll get that back actually.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, super. Thank you. And then, if you could \u2013 I know that the year ago quarter you made quite a few acquisitions. Could you once again just break out, how much the contribution from the quarter were \u2013 in terms of revenue and earnings contribution \u2013 were from the acquired assets versus just core growth?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the adjusted EBITDA for the acquisitions in the quarter was in the range of $13 million. I think overall, our acquisitions' performing well. We're pleased with the assets and the personnel that we added at Vulcan. I think \u2013 I'm very happy with the job \u2013 the integration job that our folks did in getting those tucked in and going. We're pleased with how it fits into our network. So overall, we're very pleased with the acquisitions and like what we've got.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And Kathryn, we can break out for you revenue or gross profit contribution by segment of the acquisitions offline, if you like.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","I think in total, we're probably trending toward \u2013 I think we'd said $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA at the beginning of the year \u2013 we're probably trending toward the low end of that range full-year. Still, very satisfied with performance, but as we've noted, we've had some increased investments to better manage some mine plans and improve production capacity of certain product types in some of the acquired facilities. And that explains some amount \u2013 that explains part of why we're at the lower of that range \u2013 but that's basically where we're tracking, around $40 million, but not towards $50 million.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Perfect. And then my final question is around Aggregate pricing. You've seen some accelerating in pricing as the year's progressed and really actually from prior year and carrying into Q3. Twofold question, are there certain markets we're seeing greater pricing leverage? And then two, we've just received anecdotal feedback from the field that, particularly in the Southeast, you have \u2013 I don't want to say changed your pricing structurally \u2013 but are certainly being more proactive in terms of gating pricing equally across all of your main product segments being base, fines and clean stone. Maybe if you could flesh that \u2013 either confirm or flesh out that feedback that we've been getting in the field. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think that the pricing trends we see right now are very positive and very predictable, with the pricing following the volume. I think what the good news is what we are seeing going at the end of 2015 and going into 2016 is a very healthy pricing environment. We've got steady rising demand in the vast majority of our markets; that's driving customer and construction industry confidence, which is always a good thing for pricing. But, one of the things we always have to remember is pricing is a campaign; it's something you do every day. It's thousands of price decisions every week, and it's also about the compounding improvements over time of not just pricing, but margin expansion.","So, our employees are striving hard to improve the value for our customers, and I think that if you step back and look at it, the environment that we're in right now and that we close into 2016 is very healthy for pricing improvements.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. I just want to touch on demand and maybe if you could speak to any change in trends with respect to the demand segments, whether it's infrastructure, non-res or residential. I know you've commented that you're seeing steady progression on volumes, but has there been any, whether it's change in bidding or acceleration or deceleration, in any of these segments?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that, as I said earlier, we're seeing good demand growth across all segments. Now, in the non-res piece, like you, we see the leading indicators. And we've seen them dip a little bit, but on the ground, whether it comes to shipments or bidding projects, we have not seen any dip in non-res demand. The good news is we're starting to see improvements in residential and in highway work. So, overall we're continuing to see good, steady growth \u2013 demand growth.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Garik, a few maybe pieces of the additional color since I know this \u2013 we know this is an area of focus for folks. From a geographic point of view, it's almost easier to talk about the ends of the spectrum. So, in terms of recovery toward normalized demand for us, on one end of the spectrum, certainly we have some Texas markets that are a bit further along in the recovery; in our view, still doing quite well, but a bit further along.","And on the other end, as Tom has mentioned before, we have our Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, kind of our middle of the country markets, that really haven't gotten much momentum yet in terms of the recovery moving along; but everything else is making pretty good progress. The facts and circumstances vary by market, but everything else is making pretty good progress.","The one issue that we do continue to see in some markets, and it will inform all of our plans for 2016 when we get there, is just the pace at which this growing demand and recovering demand really gets turned into Aggregates shipments. And again, in some markets that's \u2013 that's a function of large project timing and how quickly DoT's can get their raised level of funding out the door into new projects; so we'll monitor that closely. And in other markets, that's a function of these, if you will, bottlenecks in the construction supply chain that we've referenced, where availability of crews or equipment or developed land or skilled trade labor, those can really be the determinants of how quickly we grow. So, net-net, we continue to see across our portfolio, a steady, gradual repeating recovery that's basically on the same kind of trend we've been on for 2015.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Just wanted to dive in a little bit just on around the fourth quarter and your annual guidance and this fairly wide range that you've left for EBITDA for the fourth quarter. Just wanted to be clear on that range and what could drive the upper and lower end? Is it really just a function of weather and project timing or is there anything else that we should be paying attention to?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Hi, Garik, it's John. I wouldn't \u2013 we're not trying to signal anything by the breadth of that range. So, I wouldn't read too much into it first. I'd read it as unchanged from our last call. That would be the probably the main message because as I went through, most of the underlying drivers that we see are basically still on track with our last discussion on our last call. So, I think the read is largely unchanged. Yes, weather can affect it one way or the other, but I don't know that I'd try to read too much into the fact that we didn't change or narrow the range.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then just lastly, just highway bill question. You sounded a bit more optimistic, and certainly the discussions around in Congress have been more optimistic, and I think there's greater hope that a highway bill will gets passed relatively soon. If so, could you maybe talk about how this might end up impacting Aggregates demand, whether it's 2016, 2017, and what the medium to longer-term impact would be from the highway bill?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, first of all, we're very optimistic that the bill is going to get passed. We believe that the House will vote on the bill this week, as a matter of fact. When this happens, it will give certainty for states. So you'll see a number of states which are starting to \u2013 have held back funds for large projects \u2013 which is Arkansas has done that. We've seen \u2013 and now we see Georgia is talking about it \u2013 and a number of states have done it. Well, they'll have certainty for the future going forward, which will be very good for us. That is a compounding impact because a number of states have raised their funding.","But you've got to remember, there's going to be a lag here between, whether it's the increase in state funding or the federal funding, just because they've got to be able to get the funds. And then, they've got be able to set up plans and let the projects, and the projects have to start construction. So at best, I would say it'd be the end of 2016, but I think the highway bill, the impact of that, you'll really see towards the end of 2016 and into 2017.","What is hidden in there is, you will start to see states have great relief with unlocking large multi-year projects. Even if they said they're not doing it, we've got a number of them that are just hesitant to do anything until they see that bill. And that I think will flow through towards \u2013 start to flow through in 2016 \u2013 but real impact, I believe, will be in 2017. John?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","That's right.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, just one point of clarity, I know you've talked about kind of the \u2013 some of the states there in the middle of the country that you guys are in that have been laggards \u2013 but just one, if, kind of going back to the slide deck, it looks like year-to-date, North Carolina was in the greater than 5% category. But then, if you look at just for the third quarter, it was in the flat to down category. Can you talk about kind of what's driving that? Have you seen deceleration there or just your thoughts around \u2013 that just kind of stood out to me?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't read anything into that Trey. North Carolina last year, we had two very large paving jobs that we completed that weren't included in shipments of this year. So, I think that as you look at North Carolina, the demand's still healthy; it's across a broad range of whether it's res, non-res, highways or infrastructure. In fact, the North Carolina DoT just passed a bill to substantially up their funding in that state.","So overall, we feel good about North Carolina. We feel good about demand growth, think, it will carry into 2016. And we'll start to see some flow through of the $700 million increase in state highway spending \u2013 now, that won't come through right away \u2013 but you'll start to see some of it, probably end of 2016, but healthy.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Trey, you might even take that as just an example, and I know you know this very well, but of why it's a bit dangerous to extrapolate too much in our business from single quarter trends. And that's, of course, in the volume side, why we include both the quarterly view and the trailing 12-month or year-to-date view. Whether it's a volume trend or whether it's a pricing or cost trend, we're always going to encourage people to make sure you also take a slightly longer-term view and don't focus only on one quarter just because there can be so much volatility.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, understood. Thanks for the clarity there. And also, I guess as a follow-up, you guys had been fairly acquisitive, I guess, with some tuck-in deals that seemed to make a lot of sense. I guess recently \u2013 more recently \u2013 you've kind of taking your foot off, at least apparently, taking your foot off the gas a little bit there. Can you talk about, I guess, what you're seeing out there and how multiples are trending in the space? And then with that backdrop, kind of update us on your thoughts around capital deployment","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start, John. I think, Trey, there's really a good pipeline of acquisitions out there. As we've talked about a lot, they will come when they come. That's something we can't control. Last year, they all seemed to bunch up in the third quarter. I think what's important for us \u2013 well, the timing of that's unknown \u2013 what's important is the discipline of what we buy, what we pay for and then how we integrate it. And we need to be real clear about the synergies that are unique to Vulcan and how we leverage those. So, don't read, because something that happened that the pipeline's dried up, because it hasn't and we are not \u2013 we have not put \u2013 taken our foot off the accelerator at all.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And Trey, on overall capital allocation priorities, I think the key message is that our priorities have not changed and that we're making good progress on the direction we've laid out. Just to quickly tick through a few, as I mentioned, our core CapEx, reinvesting in the franchise, maintenance haz-mat capital, that remains on track and it is been executed well.","In terms of financial flexibility and our overall balance sheet, making good progress, and again, going forward, that's not a use of cash to de-lever, and we've also reduced our average interest expense a bit; we'll continue to look at that of course. We remain committed to a dividend \u2013 and the return of capital to shareholders through that dividend \u2013 that grows with earnings. That's a board decision, but nothing has changed there.","Tom just touched on opportunities for M&A-related growth where, we have many, it's just a question of discipline and to some degree, seller expectations that may be ahead of where they need to be. And then of course, as we continue to generate substantial free cash flow through time, substantial operating cash flow, we expect to have a balanced approach of reinvesting that, whether that's CapEx or M&A-like growth and returning it whether that's through dividend or share repurchase.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","That all sounds good. Thanks a lot and good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Turning back to the highway bill, the various proposals out there have some level of inflation factored in their six year view. Can you just remind investors, would the impact of that be greater than the actual dollar because of the types of projects and the long-term nature of projects? Just getting for a feel of \u2013 we haven't had a six year bill in so long \u2013 sort of a refresher course of what to do with those numbers if this thing gets passed?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me start with the escalators in the \u2013 the Senate bill escalation is 3% annually \u2013 which would mean, you start at a baseline of $41 billion; in year three, it'd be $45 billion and in year six it'd almost be $49 billion. That compares to a House bill, the drafted House bill, which is at 1.9% annually, so a little less. Now, where we end up, our vote is for the Senate bill obviously or something beyond that, but who knows how that's going to turn out.","While those increases are really important and we'll take all the funding we can get \u2013 more importantly, our country needs it \u2013 the confidence that this gives the states to move forward with long-term projects or very large projects is really important. It also \u2013 even if it's a six year bill that's only funded for three \u2013 it locks in policy for six years, which also builds confidence, not just for the states, but for the entire construction material cycle. So, you'll see this also builds on that confidence we talk a lot about for pricing momentum, because there will be funding out there, which means there'll be projects out there, which means there'll be work out there for our customers.","And so, that overall confidence is really important, not just for our customer base and pricing, but also for the states that allow them to free up more work and drive demand.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, a 2% to 3% increase, whatever it ends up being in dollars allocated, could we assume when the dollar \u2013 when they hit \u2013 it would grow the infrastructure piece of your business greater than that?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And keep in mind, that the parts of that funding that are non-federal, are growing typically in our markets at a higher rate.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good point.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","So the state and local funding is growing at a substantially higher rate in many of our markets than you see the federal dollars, but as Tom explained, the long-term federal program is certainly helpful to getting those state level funds and revenues sources from being collected to actually being spent on key projects.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Along those lines, while we've had a number of states in our footprint increase their funding, we have a number of them right now that are critical, that are debating increasing their funding, okay. This will give confidence and it will give \u2013 it creates momentum for those states to go do their part where there is much needed funding from a state and local perspective.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And at one point on \u2013 I think it was in the DRIVE Act \u2013 there was a talk of elimination of TIFIA. Is that still a topic that would be on \u2013 potentially on the table?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that's really a reduction of TIFIA. TIFIA was budgeted at $1 billion a year. The DRIVE Act cuts it down to $300 million. And actually, truth be known, that's not bad news for us because we weren't getting to \u2013 we know $300 million is about as good as anybody got to, if they got that far \u2013 to using those funds. So more than half of those funds went unused. That will go into work on intermodal and infrastructure projects. So what our view of that is, it's actually pretty good news and that we'll get what we were using in TIFIA; the unused funding of that will go into major projects to address intermodal and infrastructure projects they'll actually ship materials on.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask you, you've had a lot of success in driving gross profit per ton from $2.55 up to $3.90. And like how do we think about your ability to keep driving that \u2013 because I got to credit you, that's a ton of incremental improvement \u2013 but how much more runway is left?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Bob, it's John. Our view is pretty straight forward. We think there's substantial runway left. As you recall from our Investor Day, and we laid this out on a cash gross profit basis on Investor Day, but as we continue to move forward in the recovery, continue to move back toward normal levels of demand with the kind of pricing environment we expect, we should be able to continue converting that incremental revenue at about 60%. And doing that through this period of time gets us to a cash gross profit number that instead of being a little bit less than $6 this quarter will be a little bit above $8.","So, substantial room left. I'd remind people that as an entire construction complex, more and more people are appropriately focused on earning fair returns on capital. And earning these kind of incremental margins is consistent with that view. So, we are very, very focused on it and we don't see anything from where we sit that should limit our progress on that dimension in the near-term.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Cool. That's encouraging. Tom, I haven't heard you this bulled up in a long time; it's a really solid quarter operationally. It looks like you're getting price for service. In your forecast, you're looking at 7% price for the full-year and you obviously gave a confident view of demand trends going into 2016. So, I'm trying to reconcile a little bit how we should be thinking about pricing trends next year. You have a tough comp if you're up 7% this year. Should we expect pricing next year to be low single-digit, more like consistent with this year? Thanks and good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. It's all about the environment and I think it's in momentum. As you go into the fourth quarter of this year and into next year, as I said earlier, we continue to see that demand going up and very steady demand. It's about customer confidence. They have backlogs; they have backlogs with profitability in it, so they can raise their prices. So, it is that confidence in the pricing environment that is so key, and as we talk about a lot, it's very predictable trends that as that volume continues to trend up, pricing will follow it.","So, as we said earlier, it's the campaign of pricing and those compounding improvements over time, but going into the fourth quarter and into 2016, what I'd tell you is that that pricing environment is very healthy.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Could you just get a little more specific in thinking about 2016 to guide us? Is it more like, hey, you're at great pricing, lot of demand, we're up 7% in 2015? Against that comp would you expect to be at the low single-digit into the range next year or in a level more consistent with like 5% to 7% or 6% to 7% like this year in 2016?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Hey, Bob, it's John. While I appreciate the effort, we're not going to give guidance for 2016 on this call. But I'd just reiterate what we've said, which is, as we sit here today in early November, the core trends that we see in terms of demand recovery and the pricing environment, we see continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2016. So we don't see a significant shift in overall trajectory, but we're not prepared at this time to give specific guidance.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Totally cool. Good luck.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.","Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC","Hi, thanks, guys.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Hey, Todd.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Todd.","Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC","Let's take, hopefully, short shot at beating that almost nearly dead horse here one more time. Just real quick, and briefly I think, are you guys seeing deceleration in any aspect of your business anywhere, and if you are, where?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we've got some watch points. I'm not seeing deceleration anywhere. The watch points, as I mentioned earlier, were, one was non-res just because of some of the leading indicators. As I said earlier, we're not seeing that on the ground, what we're bidding and what we're shipping; but we see that, we watch it, and I think our folks and Todd, I'd agree, (54:32) are very confident.","The other place to watch is, as we talked about earlier, is to watch Texas, with the reduction in exploration drilling and the impact on jobs. While we've not seen any impact yet, it's been an odd year in Texas where it was the rain in the first half of the year back-loaded the year. So, if there is a drop off, it would be masked and it's a place we'll watch. But other than that, I think we're pretty confident.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","This isn't a direct answer to your question, but I would just remind folks on this \u2013 as Tom was saying \u2013 on both price and volume, there is of course, as there always is, a lot of variability across our portfolio geographically. So, if you were to look at the rates of volume growth or the rates of price growth, they're pretty well dispersed around the average. And so, we have \u2013 of course, as we get a little more clarity on our 2016 plans \u2013 we're going to have some geographies that are certainly slower growth than others, and some that are faster growth than others, and we'll have to incorporate all of that into our guidance for next year.","Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC","Perfect. Thanks for that. And then, same question. You guys talked about bottlenecks in some places. This is something that we've heard from builders and contractors and guys who use contractors. Can you talk about how much of an impact that's having and if there's any rhyme or reason? Is it certain geographies? Is it certain trades that you're seeing it in?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know that I can put a pattern to it, but we have seen a number of our customers run into bottlenecks which impacted third quarter shipments and will impact fourth quarter shipments. Now, that volume's not going away; it will be shipped. So whether that's in ready-mix business, it's trucks and drivers, it's finishers. In the Asphalt business, it's crews and lay down machines. And they're not going to ramp up \u2013 they'll ramp up a little bit, but not going to add \u2013 just have it slow down.","I think what is key to what we saw in the third quarter and you're seeing happen at the end of this year versus last year is the sense of urgency by our customers. When I say that, last year if they got delayed, they just put it off to the next week or till the weather got right. Whereas this year, we're seeing contractors work on Saturdays and Sundays; we're seeing a lot more sense of urgency of getting these jobs done, which is very good news for us because that means they have backlogs now that they got to get this work done, so they can get on to the other work, which really signals from a macro perspective that there's more work out there and we continue to see the steady growth.","Laymon Todd Vencil - CRT Capital Group LLC","Got it. Thanks for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys, good morning and congratulations. Quick question on the pricing or did you guys highlight kind of what the regional mix was versus the absolute pricing?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think that, as we said earlier, usually the places where we are further along in the cycle, we see better pricing. So, we saw better pricing in Texas in a number of places where the cycle's further along. And as we go into next year, I think that pattern or that trend tends to hold true, that the places where the cycle is a little more mature, you have a little more confidence in momentum and pricing.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Stan, it's John. One thing I just continue to underscore for those on the call is just as with volume, and I'll highlight both, but if you look at pricing by our general manager areas, if the average for the company was around 8% for the quarter, we have \u2013 and I'm just looking at what numbers I have in front of me \u2013 we have some that are 14%, 12%, 12%, 11%, 9%, and we do have a couple that are 3%, 2%, negative 1%, negative 3%. So there's a lot of dispersion based on local market factors, and in a single quarter, mix of business and other things.","The same is true on the volume side of the business. If the average volume is roughly 7.5%, then you've got some that are up 20%, 19%, 13%, 11%, 10%, 10%. But you also have a couple, as we highlighted, that are nearly \u2013 like Illinois \u2013 nearly down 10%. And so, again, any single quarter view is going to have that kind of dispersion amongst our geographic businesses, and therefore all the more reason to make sure you also take these kind of trailing 12 month or longer-term views of the business.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I appreciate that. What I was trying to get at is that some of the markets that have say mid-teen sort of absolute pricing compared to kind of some of the low double-digit pricing, just how that's influencing the overall? And my guess is that as some of those higher ASP markets continue to improve, the whole pricing complex will improve as well?","The comment about the bottlenecks and allowing some of the volumes to slip over into kind of, for the quarter or even into 2016, was that a material amount or is there any way to put a number around that?","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's really hard to put a number around. You know it's happening; you could see it happening. When you talk to your customers in the different markets, it's pretty widespread, but to put a number on that's pretty tough.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sounds fair. Thanks guys, and best of luck.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys. The environmental charge in the quarter, is that something we could see going forward or is that really one-time issue?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","I think it's primarily \u2013 this is John \u2013 primarily a one-time issue. And you saw some, if you will, elevated above recent trend cost and relating to other income and expense. And a lot of that had to do with some one-time environmental charges including some settlement of past liabilities. So, I would think most of that is one-time.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then, you mentioned that there was some places where you have ramped up labor in anticipation of demand that wasn't quite as strong as you had hoped. Where was that?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Southeast.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","J. Thomas Hill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And let me add to that. It wasn't that demand that was off or demand was poor, it just wasn't as good as they had hoped it would be.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And Tom, we've talked it about a lot, I mean they're going to be \u2013 as we continue to transition our crews and our scheduling levels, like many in the industry, from operating most of our plants as shared crews to having fully staffed plants again, there's going to be a little \u2013 the transition is not going to go perfectly. The key for us is to monitor it, manage it, correct it and to stay on top of it. But they're going to be some things like this as we transition from such historically low shipment levels back to something that's more normal, particularly given that we've been operating in some of these markets with shared crews across two or three plants. Just changing that staffing model is going to \u2013 is not going to be frictionless.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Great. Okay.

And thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow their prepared remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website vulcanmaterials.com.

Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today.","Please be reminded, the comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the Company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Finally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials.","Our second quarter results reflected our continued strong performance, a 15% improvement in adjusted EBITDA, and 11% improvement in Aggregates' gross profit per ton. We are relentlessly focused on unit margins. It is one of our most important metrics and it increased in the second quarter by $0.58 to $5.74 per ton.","On a trailing 12-month basis, our Aggregates' gross profit per ton has increased at a 12% compounded annual growth rate from the second quarter of 2013. We remain on track to achieve our full year EBITDA expectations.","Our overall results for the first half of the year, and the trajectory of the principal drivers of profitability in our Aggregates business, volume, price and cost were in line with our expectations. I'll spend a few minutes giving you some highlights of our performance in these areas.","Aggregates' shipments in the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year or 3% on a same-store basis. This growth in volume reflects the solid underlying fundamentals in our markets. Shipments in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets were particularly strong.","California experienced another wet quarter. But despite this, shipments increased compared to the same period last year. Wet weather also affected shipments in Illinois, Tennessee, and Texas.","The second driver of our profitability is price and we performed well here also. Freight-adjusted average sales price improved by 5.9%, compared to the same quarter last year.","On a mix-adjusted basis, the increase was 5.4%. The 50 basis point difference was due to favorable geographic mix. These increases were in line with our expectation and the pricing gains were widespread. Every key market across our footprint posted improved pricing.","Our third key profitability driver center zone, our cost disciplines and our operational efficiencies. Our management teams and our leaders across the company are keenly focused on this. And we're making good progress.","We measure our operational efficiencies in a number of ways, but one key financial metric for Aggregates is same-store gross profit flow-through. On a trailing 12-month basis, it was 65% at the end of June.","Our operational execution at the plant level keeps improving, and it's rewarding to see that the hard work of our men and women at Vulcan is translating into strong incremental earnings. We will continue to focus on these disciplines, because they are a significant contributor to the quality of our earnings and our ability to compound our unit margins.","As we look to the second half of the year, the overall view of our markets is duly unchanged. Shipments in the private construction end markets are good. On the public side, demand is healthy and continues to strengthen with the increases in state and local highway funding being converted into backlogs and shipments.","We believe that we are in the early stages of a longer-term growth in highway demand, which is a function of increased state and local investment in infrastructure. Since our last call, another Vulcan state, Illinois has passed legislation to increase revenues for roads.","Since 2013, 11 states that make-up 85% of our revenue have increased fuel taxes or increased other ongoing sources of revenue for highways. This supports our positive highway demand outlook and the improved visibility underpins improving pricing. In summary, our backlogs are good, and our geographic footprint and capabilities put us in a strong position to take advantage of market opportunities.","Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for some additional comments on the results. Suzanne?","Suzanne Wood","Thanks and good morning to everyone. As Tom mentioned, our trailing 12-month same-store incremental aggregates flow-through rate of 65% was quite good, while price is certainly an important driver of this metric, I also want to touch on the impact of our operating cost performance.","Operating disciplines, accountability and cost management significantly benefited our results again this quarter. Our same-store unit cost of sales increased by less than 2% as compared to the prior year's quarter. The largest single component of this increase related to greater stripping activity, which is a function of anticipated future shipments. This accounted for about 40% of the higher costs. And for information, the effect of diesel fuel cost was minor in the quarter.","Our second quarter SAG cost increased mainly due to compensation-related expense, including incentives that are tied to earnings expectations and the share price. Our incentive plans are designed to reward our people for good execution, and improved earnings, both of which we have experienced.","We also made investments in people and processes to accelerate the benefits derived from our sales and operational initiatives. Our trailing 12-month SAG expense, as a percentage of revenues, declined this year and we will continue to focus on further leveraging our SAG costs.","I'll briefly touch on our non-aggregates segments. Asphalt gross profit was $28 million, an increase of $2 million, as compared to the prior year. Shipments increased by 8% or 5% on a same-store basis, due to large projects in the Arizona market. While the year-over-year shipment growth was good, it was less than we expected due to the adverse effects of weather on California and Texas volumes.","Asphalt pricing in the quarter rose by 8%. This was partially offset by liquid asphalt unit costs, which were 16% higher this quarter compared to second quarter last year. Our concrete gross profit was in line with Q2 last year, with higher prices offsetting reduced volumes.","Turning now to the balance sheet, little has changed from first quarter, except that our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to 2.4 times within our target range. The average maturity of our debt is 15 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 4.5%. Our leverage position and debt structure provide us with significant flexibility, as we continue to grow our business.","On page 8 of the supplemental slides, you'll find information on our discretionary cash flow expectation for the full year, using the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance as the starting point. As a reminder, we define discretionary cash flow as EBITDA less working capital change, interest, taxes and operating and maintenance capital. On this basis, our discretionary cash flow for 2019 is projected to be $815 million.","While there were no share repurchases and no M&A during the quarter, these remain important parts of our capital allocation priorities. For the full year, we reiterate our expectation of spending approximately $250 million on operating and maintenance CapEx and approximately $200 million on internal growth projects.","And now, before I turn it back over to Tom, I'll take this opportunity to reaffirm our 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion. We try to be thoughtful when we gave our initial 2019 annual guidance in February. And we have performed consistent with those expectations through the first half of the year.","We believe we are well positioned to continue this execution in the second half of the year. We are mindful, however, of the storm related challenges that can characterize the third quarter and, therefore, we remain comfortable with our initial guidance range, and with finishing the year in the middle of that range.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Thanks, Suzanne. I'm very proud of how our people have performed so far this year. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women at Vulcan, especially our operations and sales teams, for taking care of our customers, holding each other to a high standard of operational excellence and delivering on our financial results as promised.","Our financial performance is important. But safety is always our number one priority. Our safety culture is strong and our safety metrics are industry-leading. It is critically important and remains our number one priority to send our employees home safely every day.","As we move forward, we will continue to capitalize on our outstanding geographic footprint, execute at the local level, take advantage of market opportunities and continue growing our Aggregates' unit margin.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We will take our first question from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Stanley.","Stanley Elliott","Hey, good morning. How are you all doing?","Tom Hill","Good.","Suzanne Wood","Good, thanks.","Stanley Elliott","Congratulations on the quarter. Could you guys talk high level kind of what you're seeing regionally -- certainly nice quarter here particularly with the weather issues?","Tom Hill","Stan, just from a high level, if you look at how each geographic area is performing, I'll start in the East. Mid-Atlantic states described the private demand slow and steady, public highway demand is very good. Importantly, we're seeing robust pricing in margin growth in the Mid-Atlantic states in 2019.","Moving to the Southeast United States, the Southeast states are really strong in the vast majority of those markets. I think the private side, we see growth a little bit of a watch in a couple of areas, Nashville, Miami. Nashville is -- the private sides are growing, but it's just long in the tooth. Miami, we're seeing a little bit of shrinkage on the private side. The rest of the Southeast states very good private, healthy demand from highways. So good volume.","We're seeing really good margin expansion in this area, driven by good pricing and also responsible operations, cost management. And remember this is -- we are by far the largest in the Southeastern United States, largest producer.","An encouraging area, Illinois. This is a market it's actually -- we're starting to see it turn. We're now seeing pickup in private demand driven by airport and tollway work. We just saw Illinois pass the highway bill, which we're thrilled with. So, more demand coming on the public side.","Non-res is growing. Res is now improving, prices are improving. This is really good news for Illinois, which has struggled for the last five or six years. It is also good news because this is a really well-run business, and with these volumes coming on, we're able to leverage that performance.","Moving over to Texas, DFW\/North Texas, very healthy public growth, slower on the private side, price and concerns on res and non-res, little bit slower pricing in North Texas. South Texas, we see public demand is actually really hot. The private side, I'd say a mixed bag, res okay. Non-res a little bit slower, but okay. Prices very healthy.","Coastal Texas, this is a very strong market both on public and private, very good pricing and margin expansion in Coastal Texas. And we've not seen anything really substantial out of the energy sector. It will be exciting for 2021, 2022.","Moving over to California. This is -- despite weather, exciting market for us. Solid public growth, particularly in Central and -- excuse me -- solid private growth, particularly in Central and Southern California. The Bay has gotten pricey on the private side. So maybe a watch for us there, but our focus there has been highways. Public side is growing and growing fast and accelerating. We've got big backlogs growing, highway lettings.","Pricing in California has been very good, is very good. We see high single-digit this year. And we've seen very good cost control in spite of bad weather in California. So substantial margin growth, everybody is concerned about California. I -- particularly, I'm not. In fact, I'm really thrilled with our performance in spite of wet weather.","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. And I'd just add one thing to that. I think in first quarter, you will remember us saying in terms of pricing that the pricing gains were very widespread across the country with all the markets. Our key markets up in pricing year-over-year save one, which was Illinois at the time and it was winter. So that wasn't of a particular concern to us.","In the second quarter, Illinois has joined the rest of our key markets and each of those key markets had pricing that exceeded second quarter last year. So we thought that was a very positive sign as well.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. And then last from me, on the cost environment. Are you seeing anything in the second half of the year, be it labor, whatever it would be that would be pause for concern in terms of what's going to happen on the pricing environment?","And then kind of as a corollary to that, you've done a nice job of putting a lot of growth CapEx and cost reduction at the quarry level and at the distribution level. Help us with that in terms of how we think about managing that cost structure going forward?","Tom Hill","Yeah, I think you saw a very good performance in cost in the second quarter. Our total cost of sales was up 2% in spite of wet weather through a number of our states, which really eats up operating efficiencies. So we overcame that. The biggest driver of the increase is, you heard Suzanne say the second quarter was stripping in anticipation of sales volume growth. So I'll take that problem all the time.","We saw good improvements on operating efficiencies and the things that drive our cost. Our folks are very focused on this, more to come. I can't tell you how focus our operators are on improving their operating efficiencies that really drive the cost.","But based on our performance in Q2, they are winning. This is so important as you know, because it's a big driver of those unit margins and being able to take that incremental revenue to the bottom line. So as I would describe the rest of the year, more to come and I would expect us to keep improving our operating efficiencies. ","Stanley Elliott","Perfect, thank you very much. Congratulations and best of luck. ","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. ","Tom Hill","Good morning, Jerry.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Hi, Tom, Suzanne, Mark, how are you?","Tom Hill","Good.","Jerry Revich","Good. Can you talk about the pricing cadence on the spot market heading into the back half of the year? Now that we have six months in the book, so I'm wondering if the high end of your initial pricing guidance is still achievable? Or if there are mixed factors we should keep in mind as well?","Tom Hill","You know we talk a lot about price. I think that remember that most of the fixed -- fixed plant was priced in January and February. We did see some successes in mid-year price increases to fixed plants in a number of markets Virginia, Alabama, it goes to some of the Gulf Coast, Arizona. The other 60% of our work is bid work and we bidding in as we speak. We always tell you that's a -- that's not a spot market price increase, that's a campaign over time.","And we feel good about what we see in our backlogs and our booking pace, we think those prices will move up through the balance of the year as we bid. And all of that's driven by confidence and visibility into a growing market particularly, the very visible and very fast growing public market and highways.","So I think as you look at, as we step back and Suzanne look at our booking pace. And how our back pricing as that is going, and the pricing in our backlogs, we are very comfortable that the balances of the year price increases will be in line with guidance.","Jerry Revich","And in terms of -- is it, is there any potential to get to the high end of the guidance? So to get to the high end, you'd have to put up pricing north of 8%. It sounds like we're probably gravitating toward the midpoint of the guidance which implies pricing closer to, call it 6.5% in the back half compared to that\u2026","Tom Hill","I'd say you -- I would say more toward the middle of the range of guidance. I think that's a realistic and very achievable goal.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then to shift gears for asphalt, in the past you folks have gotten that business to be in the mid-to-high teens from a gross margin standpoint. And I'm wondering, is there anything structurally different in this cycle compared to the past, because when we're looking at 8% gross margins in a business that has about 8% SG&A to sales.","That's not a fantastic profit contribution even with a great flow through that you're getting in aggregates. So I'm wondering, is there something structurally different in asphalt mix this cycle versus the past? Or when can we get back to those teens type gross margins?","Tom Hill","Well, I think the simple answer is no, there's nothing structural change in Asphalt. This is a function liquid pricing and cost. And I think you're seeing a turn there. Overall, we are seeing profitability in the Asphalt product line improving both in volume and unit profitability.","You saw that in Q2 with volumes up 8%. And that was both volumes were up in spite of wet weather in Tennessee, Texas and California, where -- some of our biggest asphalt states.","Liquid costs were up $11 million. However, gross profit per ton was flat. This stopped a six quarter run of shrinking unit margin in asphalt, due to liquids prices spiking. That levelled off as you remember -- fourth quarter to first quarter, and it's been pretty much flat through the first half.","Looking ahead, I would expect unit margins to be on the rise as asphalt prices are rising and liquid prices has stabilized. If you step back and look at the full year, I would maybe expect us to end up a little on the lower end of guidance in asphalt.","And that's really a function of wet weather in the first half of the year. We just had so much rain in Tennessee, Texas and California that we don't know that we'll have enough shipping days to get the volume, we expected before the end of the year. Now that being said, our backlogs are very good. Our lettings are growing and the unit margins are growing.","So between rising unit margins, big backlogs, a dramatic increase in how we're funding and lettings in Vulcan states, this product line has a very bright future.","Suzanne Wood","And I would add to that with respect to the guidance for the remainder of the year, Tom's right, you know we're just being a bit cautious in evaluating the number of shipping days we have left and the ability of our contractors to perform all of that work in a very compressed timeframe.","If you go back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for the non-aggregates segment, which is asphalt, as well as Concrete and Calcium, we said that we expected that to grow year-over-year the gross profit by 15% to 20%. We now think that that gross profit year-over-year growth will probably be toward the lower end of that, at about 15%. Again, being a little bit cautious on that. And I think that in terms of consensus, most of the consensus is at about 15% anyway.","Jerry Revich","Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Schrier of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Scott.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Scott Schrier","Hi, Good morning everyone. So last 12 months, you had 65% incremental margins. They are over your company norms and your target levels. It looks like you have good cost control, you have volumes to support the fixed cost absorption, pricing in the mid-single digit range, you've got you're stripping out of the way this quarter. Is it possible to maintain a 65% run rate given the compounding profitability characteristics of Aggregates? I'm not asking you to commit to it of course, taking into account all your comments on guidance, but I'm curious what would be needed? And is it possible to sustain an elevated level of profitability?","Tom Hill","I think, we -- first of all, let me if I misspoke on stripping, I didn't mean to -- the stripping is not out of the way. That will continue through the year because of demand and what we see coming with particularly with the highway demand. So stripping costs will stay up for a while, and I would expect them to stay up, I know they stay up between for at least the next six months. Again, that's a good thing because it's anticipating big volume growth driven by public demand.","I think, we hate sound like a broken record, but we're going to take you always back to 60, not the good things can't lineup in a row for a while to get you above 60. But we point out well you have a lot of tailwinds. This is -- this sport is played outside, there is a lot of things that can happen and to offset just the tailwinds. You're not going to have them, you're going to get -- you're going to get some things that are going to challenge you along with the good stuff. So just from experience, can you have a period at above 60? Yes. Can you have a period of below 60? Yes. But I think, we'd always bring you back to 60.","Scott Schrier","Got it. Understood. And then I wanted to ask another one on the cost side of things and your cost containment. And I'm curious, if you could speak to some of the efficiencies of profitability you're seeing in some of the long-haul markets, either through your vessels and container road or the rail networks and also a little more on that, we've been hearing about some moderation in transportation costs. And I'm wondering if there's some puts and takes there. One of the things that we've heard or you have spoken about in the past is higher transportation cost generally enhance the economic moat of the Aggregates business, but is there the potential that moderating costs could actually potentially open up some more competition in pressure pricing? Thank you.","Tom Hill","I think first of all, the cost I'm referring to is our actual operating costs, not transportation. It's actually the cost to produce and sell rock taking the logistics -- taking most logistics out of that. So I'm really referring to our total cost of sales to produce stone, ex-transportation.","Going to your transportation question, we are seeing rising costs for long-haul transportation, particularly by rail. As you know, this is a spike, but it's real this year. The Mississippi River and the river transportation costs have been delayed and higher due to flooding. So, I would tell you that particularly long-haul transportation, we continue to see it escalate not go down, no level it is actually going up at a pretty good path.","Scott Schrier","Got it. Great, thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Kathryn.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thanks -- thank you for taking my questions today. On press release, more on the policy related with Illinois and also following up on SB-1 and Prop 7. But with Illinois, could you give -- just given the increased funding, give more color in terms of what end markets you primarily serve in Illinois today? And what has it looked back historically, when there was actual funding for infrastructure? And shifting for SB-1 and Prop 7, are you seeing the full impact of those two initiatives? Or do you believe that funding and lettings will continue to grow? Thank you.","Tom Hill","Illinois, we really service the full market and it's -- we're not focused on the private, particularly the private or the public, and we service non-res, res, public and highways.","It's nice to see Illinois turn the -- that how we work -- that how the funding will take a while to flow through as it does in every state. However, particularly in Illinois, we think we'll get bridged because there is substantial tollway and airport funding, which is very close to one of our largest quarries up there. But Illinois doubled their gas tax from $0.19 to $0.38, it is firewalled. It will take -- that will actually double the capital expenditures in Illinois for highways over ship -- now over a six-year time frame.","And as I said, we're starting to see res and non-res turn. I think we're slowing the res, this is a very well managed business for us. So as I said earlier, this is exciting, because we are improving unit margins regardless of -- we've been improving unit margins in Illinois despite challenges for volume. This volume growth will really put some, put the turbos to that and so we'll enjoy that.","As far as highways, excuse me, highway spending is concerned, across the country. We're excited about it and I'll run through eight or nine of those if you allow me. Florida highway lettings in 2020 will be up 25%. Georgia highway lettings will double in fiscal year 2020. We expect highway lettings in Texas to be up 25%. VDOT and regional authorities should be up 20%, South Carolina up 10%, Tennessee revenues have doubled -- excuse me, have gone up 40% since the Improve Act passed.","California is very exciting. We've seen since SB1 through fiscal year, 2017-2018, we have seen lettings double. They will be up another $1 billion in fiscal year 2020, which just started. So to your point, highway lettings are very good and dramatically improving over the next 12 months.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, very helpful. And then shifting to the residential end market. Where are you seeing areas of strength, weakness and what's the cadence of growth you're seeing on your -- for your major markets? Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you. Starting in the west, res in California is good a watch for us would be San Francisco, which has it's gotten pricey. Moving to Arizona, res is quite strong, non-res and res due to the private side in Texas, probably a watch in DFW, where Houston is strong. The Southeast, the private market is quite good across the vast majority of our markets. In the Southeast, the watch for us would be residential and Nashville, which is -- our shipments are growing in residential, we're really watching it because it has been there a long time and it's been very high, long time. Miami a little bit different story, probably some contraction in the private side in Miami. In the Mid-Atlantic, I would describe the private side as steady slow growth.","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. Kathryn, and I would just add to that again, looking at our geography, our footprint in the markets we serve, I mean the fundamentals continue to be in place you've heard us mention those a number of times. Good population growth, good employment growth with respect to res, still relatively speaking, a low level of houses. I mean, we are certainly not back anywhere close to peak starts and then with the interest rate environment and the fed signaling that it is -- while things can always change, I mean it's relatively unlikely that we're going to have a rate rise in the next little bit. I mean those are fundamentals we watch all the time that are generally moving in a positive direction.","Kathryn Thompson","Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Rohit Seth of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Suzanne Wood","Hey, Rohit.","Rohit Seth","Hey, how you doing?","Tom Hill","Good.","Rohit Seth","My question on the energy projects. You touched on that a little bit in the prepared remarks, but can you just talk a little bit about the opportunity set and what you are seeing there?","Tom Hill","Yeah. We are following about a dozen projects that are multi-year, multi-million ton projects that are at different stages in the pipeline. And all are in different stages. Most, the vast majority of this work will ship between 2020 and 2023. So we're not there yet. There is a little bit shipping around the fringes, a few of those. So, we're trying to help those folks, get numbers and get those projects ready and get them started.","Remember that, with our Bluewater capacity, it gives us an edge here with these projects. They will be exciting. We are working on them. But they would -- I would expect them to start impacting us until sometime mid-year 2020.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And then I just wanted to talk about your backlog. You guys just put a slide together in your deck, showed the highway backlog. Would you characterize that as moving up, down or kind of stable?","Tom Hill","I would describe highway work dramatically moving up, and that will continue to escalate over the next five to seven years.","Rohit Seth","Okay. Thank you. That's all I got.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Trey.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Trey Grooms","Hey. Good morning, everyone. First should be on, just I guess some housekeeping here on the mix benefit that you guys realized in the quarter on price. Was that more of a product related mix benefit or was there a geographic benefit there? And then any expected mix impacted in the third quarter?","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. The 50 basis points was geographic mix.","Trey Grooms","Okay.","Tom Hill","As far as the second half mix, I wouldn't expect, there always be some kind of mix with geography and a little bit of product, but I wouldn't expect it to be dramatic in the second half of the year.","Trey Grooms","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then, you also -- you mentioned the stripping costs, and of course that can happen from one quarter to the next. And I think you said that it's going to be ongoing, and then also with freight costs, you said it's still going up for you guys on the longer haul stuff. But as we look at the increase in COGS that we saw in the quarter, I think it was the 2%, is that a similar kind of rate that we should be thinking about as we look in the back half when we're looking at these costs?","Tom Hill","I would tell you that the short answer to your question is yes. I think that our folks are doing a good job, as I said earlier, executing on those operating disciplines that drive cost and the efficiency with that. I think it's important this that you take that cost and take it to unit margins. We saw unit margins in the second quarter up 11% to $5.34. We've now put together three quarters in a row with double-digit unit margin improvement, and that is a combination of solid pricing, but very good operating execution. And it's not about spending money. It's really about the execution of the operating disciplines that drive costs.","So, you heard me thank our folks, the men and women at Vulcan that drive those unit margins, I'd like to do that again, because they are now consistently turning in double-digit improvements in gross profit per ton. So, I would expect us to continue our operating disciplines and the cost to follow.","Trey Grooms","Yeah. I know that operating execution has really been a focus for you guys. Congrats on the good results there. Last one for me is just on you -- of course, the Illinois market you mentioned in Texas and Tennessee saw delays, but to Suzanne point earlier on. I think we were talking about ready-mix. But there is only so many hours in a day and so many days in a quarter and in a year. So, as we're kind of looking at these -- the delays that we saw in some of these markets for you guys, I know the underlying demand is there, that's pretty clear. But, how do we think about the opportunity to kind of execute or realize on some of this may be pent-up demand that might be there?","Tom Hill","Yeah. So, I think you're right. You're exactly right. There is only half the year left or less than half the year left now. We also have some bottlenecks for transportation. I think the underlying demand is there, that demand is not going away. So whatever we don't ship in 2019, we will ship in 2020 that you saw the perfect example to that is in January of this year when that work would be pin-up and shipped in January. So, it will really be a function to some degree of weather and timing on some large projects.","I think -- if you don't mind, I'll stop and step back and kind of let you know how we look at the second half of the year. As you heard Suzanne say, we are very comfortable with our guidance. I think we tried to be thoughtful when we gave you guidance in February. We said the upper end would be good weather and jobs starting on time. The lower end would be increment weather and jobs delayed.","As you look at us giving guidance -- staying in that guidance range for the balance of the year, what we want to do is be prudent about weather and timing on jobs. We had a really good start to the year with January extremely strong with that flow through of work from 2018 pushing back.","The rest of the year shipments, the other five months has actually been at the high end of our guidance, next January. But now we need to remember that the third quarter is our most volatile quarter. It is the peak of the construction season, at the same time; it is also the heart of the storm season. We've all experienced one storm and luckily didn't flip us too bad. So, we're just trying to be realistic and transparent about storm threats in the middle of peak of construction season.","If you move to pricing, our pricing has consistently through the year been in line with guidance. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year, and our look at that is solid I believe in our guidance.","As we talk about our operating disciplines, we have executed well and created cost savings. All of that has driven double-digit unit margin growth for the first half of the year. We would expect that to continue for the balance of the year. So, I would think we'd be on the high side of Aggregates' volume guidance.","Moving to Asphalt, Asphalt work was -- as we talked about was delayed in the first half because of rain in Tennessee, California, Texas, those are three of our biggest Asphalt states. So, in spite of very big backlogs and growing lettings and growing unit margins, some of that work may get pushed back just because of what we talked about the number of times.","As Suzanne mentioned, a bit extra cost in incentives and investment in unit margin on SAG. So, I would expect the year to play out this way. A bit stronger on Aggregates' earnings, a bit lower on Asphalt earnings. You put all that together, I would tell you that Suzanne and I are confident in the year in the middle of our guidance range.","Trey Grooms","Thanks a lot.","Tom Hill","You bet.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","Hi, thanks. And thanks for all the detail on the guidance, Sue. You kind of answered a lot of my questions there. But I wanted to ask your backlogs are very strong, you've got a stronger outlook across your geographies and I know we're not talking formerly about 2020.","But if you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, what would be the limiting factor outside of say weather to drive volume growth as you see here -- it just sounds like your visibility has gotten better. So, is there certain capacity constraints in the market that would limit your ability to continue to grow it, call it this low to mid-single-digit volume clip or anything else out there that it could be I guess inhibiting factor for you?","Tom Hill","I don't think I see inhibiting factors that would limit mid-single -- low to mid-single volume growth. I think that's achievable. I think when you get above that, it gets tougher because of things like transportation and labor for our customers, not for us but for our customers.","You also are seeing maturity on a lot of highway dollars and mixed in that are bigger and bigger more complex jobs, the timing of which it can be all over the place. We've had a few jobs delayed even this year with some big highway work and still we're shipping well within our -- excuse me, the top end of our range of guidance.","So, to answer your question, I don't see it for the numbers that you say. Now, if you want to get to high single-digit, yeah, you start to get compressed with labor and transportation and just our customers' capacity.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. And I just wanted to ask just on G&A just given the bump due to the performance compensation in the quarter, how should we think about G&A costs through the balance of the year?","Suzanne Wood","Yeah, it's a good question. The -- we had initially guided back at the start of the year to around $355-ish million. We now expect that number to be somewhere between $360 million, $365 million.","Obviously, we will continue to look for ways to leverage that. But year-over-year that will put us put our SG&A, expenses or our SAG expenses. I should say, as a percentage of revenues, basically in line with where they were last year, maybe just a tick below.","And I -- it's important that we made some of the investments we did because again, we are on a very serious course here to improve our unit margins. We have a number of operational initiatives under way.","And so, I think making investments there to help further those initiatives and hopefully deliver results a bit quicker are good investments to make. So yeah, hopefully that updated guide is helpful. I think the consensus on SAG expenses for the full year is about $360 million. So, pretty much in line with that.","Garik Shmois","Okay, thanks. I just wanted to ask just one more question. Just on pricing, are you seeing any markets, I know you don't, like before, we talked about mid-year price increases because you're continuously evaluating pricing, on a job-by-job basis.","But are there any markets that are structurally, just given the demand strength coming in maybe toward the higher end of your guidance, that are tighter on supply and in turn fundamentally seeing more attractive supply demand environment in terms of potentially better pricing environment?","Thomas Hill","I think there is, few markets where certain sizes are tight. And there is pricing opportunity. But I think the big driver on pricing is the visibility on demand is coming. And the people's confidence that they have worked and they can take risk on to form pricing and profitability.","And I think that's pretty broad spread and it's followed -- a lot of it's followed the increases in state and local funding, as we talked about in all the states that drive the vast majority of our revenues.","So, while that's out there, I think the big driver is more fundamental and more ingrained, which is a good thing. Because it means it's more long-term.","Garik Shmois","Great, thanks for the help.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Thomas Hill","Good morning.","Phil Ng","Hi.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Phil Ng","Good morning. Nice to see the acceleration in pricing this year in Aggregates, backlogs are quite strong, and pushing you some bottlenecks on the shipment side. Is this level of momentum on growth on pricing sustainable for the next few years?","Thomas Hill","Short answer is I think the answer is yes.","Phil Ng","Okay.","Thomas Hill","And the reason I have confidence in that is because of the long-term growth substantially growing funding. And on the public side and highways and how visible that is and how sure that is.","And so you put those, that you picked that -- there is growing, that is very visible and that is shared and protected. Gives people confidence throughout the construction sector that they can take risk on price.","Phil Ng","Got it and just on that note, appreciating that most of the highway funding has been driven more at the state level, but with funding for the Highway Trust Fund expected to wind down next year.","What are some of the milepost that you are looking at, from a timing perspective before you think, if nothing gets done. You could see some of these projects push out or stall a little bit?","Thomas Hill","Well, first of all, I don't see the demand stalling because of the -- how the Federal funding. If you take, let's step back and look at Federal funding, first and then we'll go into total highway demand.","The House and the Senate are working on a highway bill. Our policymakers and key committees are working on the reauthorization package now.","Phil Ng","Yeah.","Thomas Hill","Recently, the Senate Environmental Public Works Committee is right now working on a bill, which would increase funding by 28%. We'll see what happens with that. And funding is a big part of the ongoing conversation.","But that being said about the highway bill reauthorization, you got to remember two really important facts when it comes down to highway demand. Number one, Feds are not going to let highway funding go down even if the FAST Act expires. They'll just \u2013 they'll make extensions and keep the funding there regardless. Number two, our states are extremely well \u2013 our states and local governments are extremely well funded. So funding in Vulcan states is up 60%, that's an increase of over $20 billion per year in 11 states.","Now remember, put that in perspective, that's $20 billion in 11 states versus a Federal bill, which is $45 billion over 50 states. And that funding is really starting to flow through those \u2013 we're starting to ship one, and you are seeing the lettings grow. So highway demand will grow, absolutely grow over the next five to seven years.","Phil Ng","Got it.","Suzanne Wood","And I would just also add to that \u2013 that historically, at times in the past, when it was time for a Federal bill to be renewed, states have operated in this Federal bill extension mode. So, they understand how to do that and are comfortable with doing that, and I think the other point I would make is that, if you divide the highway spending among Federal, state and local levels, it's about a third, a third, a third. So that's why we keep talking a lot about this state funding and local funding and the importance of it, because that represents about two-thirds of the spending.","Phil Ng","Got it. That's really helpful color guys. And just one last one for me, question for you, Suzanne. Based on the outlook for next few years from a growth standpoint -- definitely sounds strong, directionally, how should we think about CapEx and capital deployment priorities? There was obviously a few big deals in the market a few years ago, but just curious how you thinking about M&A, the pipeline and just directionally, the sizing of some of these potential target?","Suzanne Wood","Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you looked at the M&A, we've typically done in the past. It's been more of the bolt-on variety as opposed to big M&A. I mean loyalty \u2013 deals come and go in the market. We take a look at the deals when they arise, because that's just good practice to do that. But we have been very disciplined with our approach to M&A, and we would continue to be so. We have pretty big hurdle rates that the deals have to get over. They have to be very strategic to us. They have to be accretive to our return on investment profile. They have to be something that significantly extends the value of the franchise, and they have to be something \u2013 they have to be deals that we can integrate quickly and efficient at least so we are able to derive the synergies from them.","So we continue to look, but again, we are disciplined, we would wait for the right thing. And we're not going to \u2013 we're not going to be crazy about multiples that is \u2013 that is not helpful in any event. If we think about other uses of that capital from a growth perspective, I mean, remember we're going to be spending about $200 million this year on growth CapEx, our internal growth projects, we're really excited about those. It is a way to enhance and generate EBITDA without a lot of risk and without paying some blue sky goodwill that you might have to pay, if you were to do a bit of M&A.","And just as a reminder, some of those growth projects that we are working on this year and which are embedded in that $200 million projected spend are some Greenfield quarries that are in geographic areas that are beneficial to us, California, Texas, South Carolina, and in addition to that and personally, I'm very excited about this part. We also have a number of sales yards strategically located in the U.S. that when they come online would extend our franchise and our ability to reach customers.","So M&A is one pathway, but for me, low risk EBITDA enhancing, extend the value of the franchise I quite like some of these internal growth projects. And again, we put those through a pretty strenuous return on investment review and they are accretive as well.","Phil Ng","Got it. Thank you for the color.","Suzanne Wood","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Wood of Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Mike.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Michael Wood","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hi. I wanted to ask your markets in cement are impacted at all by the merger of the two large state owned [Technical Difficulty] in China and does that had a positive or negative impact on pricing in concrete?","Tom Hill","I wouldn't see it affecting our markets in concrete positive or negative, I don't see a lot of impact for that. Now that being said, we\u2026","Michael Wood","Okay. And\u2026","Tom Hill","Go ahead. I'm sorry.","Michael Wood","And then I'm curious, since you improved that segment as well in 2Q versus 1Q, but you saw lower gross profit year-over-year. So just if you can also talk about your confidence in the back half and how you're seeing pricing the end market?","Tom Hill","Yeah. The -- actually our volumes is what we were -- gross profit was actually slightly down 2%, and that was really driven by volumes being down. Some of that was rain in Texas, some of that was timing of work in Virginia. Our prices were actually up 5% and unit margins were up 5%. So assuming we can get our projects going and get a little sunshine I think we will be fine for the rest of year in concrete.","Michael Wood","And on Aggregates, can you give us some [Technical Difficulty] the weather impact in the lost shipping days in the quarter?","Tom Hill","Yeah, I mean that's a dramatically -- that's a big mixed bag. We're in the quarter, I'll give you a few examples in big markets where we got hurt. Dallas had another 15 days of rain, San Antonio had an increase of 24 days of rain, Houston had an increase of six days, in California we saw, LA of five days, San Francisco of nine days. So I guess that kind of gives you a feel for what that was like, and Knoxville was up dramatically, but I don't remember exactly the number of days in Knoxville. So, and then if you look at Illinois, we lost a full month, we lost 22 days in Chicago.","Suzanne Wood","And if you go back and look at the shipment volume guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year, which was 3% to 5%, you'll remember we talked about what would put us at the top end of the range and what would put us at the lower end of the range the 3%. And the two things we called out that would put us there would have been delay of some big projects that's sometimes just unavoidable, it's outside the control and also weather.","And so given the fact that Q2 was wet and as Tom just described, I mean, we were frankly, we were pleased to have our volume growth come out at 4% in the quarter because don't forget California and Texas two of the markets we've called out as being quite wet as have others. Those two markets comprise about 30% give or take of our volume. So we were pretty pleased.","Michael Wood","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Tom Hill","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Mike.","Suzanne Wood","Good Morning.","Mike Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tom Hill","Sure.","Mike Dahl","Suzanne, I wanted to pick up on that last that last comment, and if you think about the performance in the quarter, despite some of the headwinds, it doesn't actually seem like that much of a heavy lift to get -- you're not just at the top end of the volume guide, but maybe a bit above the volume guide for the year and Tom I know you made the comment that maybe it's high-end of that and then so the 5% range, but has just more specifically thinking about what you've seen quarter-to-date, is there anything you'd point out as far as volume cadence? And kind of what to expect for magnitude of growth in 3Q versus 4Q?","Tom Hill","Yeah, I think, let's just concentrate on the third quarter and really for the balance of the year, but I think what you heard me say was, we're trying to be prudent, going into the third quarter and the underscore there is the third quarter is the peak of the construction season, but it's also the peak of the storm season.","So that can go really, really well or that can go really, really tough or it can be a mixed bag. And so I think us telling you the high end of our guidance is trying to take some of that into for volume is trying to take some of that into account. The perfect example to that is what we saw in the first half in California. And so it's really trying to be thoughtful and trying to give you our best educated expectation of what we expect based on history and based on our backlogs and based on what we see is a booking pace.","Suzanne Wood","That's right. And I would, I would just add to this, I've got the numbers here for the second half last year in -- I have the third quarter as well. But let's not forget, last year in the third and fourth quarter, those who were not -- I don't really consider them to be terribly easy comparisons. If you look at the second half last year, our volume grew 9%, our gross profit per ton grew 11%, and for the two quarters combined, our flow-through was about 63%. That's a pretty good performance that we would be talking about over-achieving here. Price was at 2%, perhaps there is some upside there, but it was a pretty strong volume and gross profit per ton second half.","Mike Dahl","Great. I appreciate that. But I guess it's good to hear that that upper end it sounds like it actually does and you corporate the -- some conservatism around the weather, which is great. The second question I had is bigger picture, you kind of alluded to a few different time some of the internal initiatives and now some of these are earlier stage than others, but can you give us a flavor on some of the internal initiatives that you're using to drive unit margins over the next couple of years? Where are we at on some of the big initiatives? And can you quantify any goal posts for us to be thinking about in terms of impact?","Tom Hill","From a very high level, what drives our quality earnings is what drives gross profit per ton. Again, at a high level, that would include four areas of focus, commercial excellence, our logistics efficiencies, number three how we procure our goods and services and the fourth, our operating disciplines and the disciplines around those efficiencies that drive cost. Now we've been working on these at different stages over the last few years. We've invested in people and processes and systems to improve our metrics in our disciplines.","And what you're seeing is results, improvements in our gross profit per ton. Again, bragged on our people in this earlier, we've put together now three quarters where we've had double-digit improvement unit margins, so solid work. But as you pointed out, we are far from being done, we got a long ways to go. And when you start talking about goalposts, this -- you got to remember this is an ultra-local business, and every one of our markets and submarkets has their goalposts. But putting those together is not as nearly as important as what happens on that local level. So this is exciting. We've done a lot of hard work. We got a lot more hard work to do. So but I congratulate our folks for being disciplined and being diligent with this, but more to come on these efforts.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Sure.","Operator","We will take our final question from Robert Muir of Berenberg Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Robert.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Daniel Wang","Hi, this is actually Dan on for Rob.","Tom Hill","Oh, great.","Daniel Wang","Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick question with regards to the split between the three end markets. Is there any way to quantify the performance of like infrastructure res and non-res. In particular, I remember last quarter around the Southeast non-res was particularly strong. I was just wondering whether that has continued and what you've seen across your geographic footprint? Thanks.","Tom Hill","I think that we would describe the private side in most of our market is growing and steady growth. A few places a little harder than others. The public side is growing and growing faster and will continue to grow faster. I would call the public side absolutely across our footprint we see growth. Again, as Suzanne said, the fundamentals for the private side, which are population growth, employment growth, very low inventories of houses and now we expect lowering interest rates.","That is a good formula for private demand growth. Put that with the dramatically growing funding from highways and that maturing into lettings and now into shipments that is a great formula for public demand growth. So I would call it solid and exciting, and I will call it solid and exciting across our footprint.","Daniel Wang","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tom Hill","Thank you. Well, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your interest in Vulcan and your time this morning. And we look forward to discussing the Company and our results and our performance throughout the quarter. Look forward to seeing you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"21944":["Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Donald M. James - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee","Danny R. Shepherd - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Keith Maher - Singular Research","Operator","Good morning. My name is Shay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO, you may begin your conference.","Donald M. James","Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2013 results. I am Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's second quarter 2013 earnings release.","Turning now to Slide 3, I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. Each of our business segments reported solid growth in second quarter earnings, contributing to consolidated gross margin expansion and significant earnings per share improvement as compared to the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations were $30 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $17 million or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. We achieved these results despite challenging wet weather conditions. Aggregate shipments increased 2% compared to last year, despite significantly wetter weather in all of our markets in the eastern half of the United States.","Our shipment levels in the first 2 months of the quarter were well above the same period last year. June shipments were sharply lower as wet weather blanketed many of the markets we serve. Assuming more normal weather conditions in the second half of the year, we anticipate the trend of improving shipments to continue, and to be driven primarily by growth in private construction activity.","We achieved broad-based improvement in aggregate pricing, which was up 4% overall with growth in virtually all of our markets. Over each of the past 4 quarters, our year-over-year quarterly price gains have been at least 4%, and the geographic breadth of pricing improvement has expanded. Our reported price improvement is adjusted for freight cost incurred to transport aggregates from a producing quarry to a sales yard. We believe measuring our price improvement in this way provides a clearer view of changes in actual realized prices. Without this freight adjustment, our year-over-year price improvement was even greater.","As we look ahead, we remain encouraged by improving trends in private sector construction. Vulcan-served states are among the fastest-growing in the country, accounting for more than 60% of all new construction in both housing starts and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings as measured by square feet. This trend bodes well for earnings growth both in our aggregates businesses and in our non-aggregates segments. We are also pleased to see contract awards for highways were up 10% through the first half of the year, an indication that highway funding stability is returning now that the federal highway bill is in place.","Moving now to Slide 4. This provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. Consolidated net sales increased $47 million or 7%. Gross profit increased $27 million as each segment reported year-over-year improvement in earnings. Accordingly, gross profit margin increased 280 basis points. Volume in ready-mixed concrete and cement increased 15% and 20%, respectively, due to improving levels of private construction. Texas and Florida delivered very strong improvements in ready mix volume, up 46% and 25%, respectively.","EBITDA was $164 million, an increase of $61 million from the prior year second quarter. During the second quarter, the company sold certain operating assets in lower-margin, lower-growth markets in the Midwest. These transactions generated a pretax gain of $21 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Additionally, in the quarter, we increased our aggregate reserves and operations in attractive markets in Texas.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter.","Danny R. Shepherd","Thanks, Don. As Don mentioned in his opening remarks, wet weather was a major factor in the second quarter, affecting shipments and production efficiency. Slide 5 provides some context to the amount of precipitation in the second quarter. The amount ranks the amount of precipitation in every state relative to the last 119 years of data as captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","The darker-green color and higher number -- higher the number, the greater the precipitation. As you can see, all of our markets in the eastern half of the U.S. were significantly impacted by rain, and in some cases, historical levels of rain. To help illustrate how to interpret this data, I'll focus on Georgia. In 2012, the map on the left, the number 38 indicates that there were only 37 years over the past 118 years when the second quarter was drier than it was in 2012. In contrast, the map indicates that there were only 5 years when the second quarter was wetter than it was in 2013. Notwithstanding the extreme weather comparison, our second quarter shipments in Georgia increased 9% in 2013. And even though we were repeatedly challenged by weather events, you'll see on Slide 6 that each of our segments increased earnings due to strong demand in some markets, and effective cost management.","Our aggregate segment, which I'll cover in more detail in a minute, reported increased shipments, prices and earnings. Non-aggregates earnings increased $12 million due to improving private construction demand, which benefited concrete and cement volumes and increased material margins in asphalt due to lower liquid asphalt cost. The concrete earnings improvement reflects higher shipments and lower costs. The improvement in cement earnings is due to higher shipments, higher prices, and lower cost.","Now turning to Slide 7. You see that aggregates gross margins increased 130 basis points due to higher volumes and pricing. Aggregate shipments in a number of markets increased sharply versus the prior year, and furthermore, instead of a series of major storms leading to the wet weather, the consistent, steady rainfall meant that many locations never completely dried out.","Wet weather not only results in lower aggregate shipments, but it also leads to production inefficiencies which impacts cost. For the first 2 months of the quarter, aggregate shipments were trending nicely, up 5% setting us up for a strong June finish to the quarter. Typically, June shipments are greater than May shipments, as the construction season ramps up. However, June shipments were less than the prior year and were lower than May shipments, an outcome that has only happened once before in the last 10 years. Markets in the Midwest and Virginia reported year-over-year declines in shipments due to wet weather and the presence of some large project work in the prior year's second quarter.","Markets in Arizona, Texas and California reported 56%, 23% and 13% increases in shipments due primarily to growth in private construction. Additionally, we were pleased to see many markets achieve quarterly volume growth despite wet weather conditions. Aggregate shipments in Florida and along the Central Gulf Coast are examples of markets where we experienced strong volume growth despite wet weather conditions. Shipments in Florida increased more than 50% versus the prior year. This underscores the broader trend in demand growth we see in much of our geographic footprint as private construction activity continues to recover. I'll say that July shipments have rebounded nicely due to solid demand growth even with the continuation of wetter-than-normal weather.","Slide 8, aggregates prices continued to gain traction. The year-over-year improvement is broad-based across our markets, almost without exception. For the fourth quarter in a row, prices went up at least 4%, underscoring that markets are recovering, and that the attractive characteristics of the aggregates business remain intact. Because of our disciplined approach to pricing and cost management, the earnings leverage in our aggregates business continues to increase, as you see on Slide 9. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cash gross profit was $4.19 per ton, 25% higher than it was at the peak -- prior peak in shipments in the first quarter of 2006, and superior to our peers. This high unit profitability positions us well for greater earnings leverage from incremental tons that will come with future growth and demand.","With that, thank you, and I'll turn the call back over to Don.","Donald M. James","Thanks, Danny. If you'll turn with me now to Slide 10, you'll see that strengthening our balance sheet remained probable [ph], and we are just doing just that through debt reduction and improving EBITDA. During the past 12 months, we have reduced our total debt by $190 million, while also investing $111 million in strategic assets and reserves in Georgia and Texas. Debt-to-EBITDA has improved from 6.3x 1 year ago to 5.4x as of June 30 of this year, and we expect further improvement in the coming year.","Turning now to our end markets on Slide 11. As you all know, housing starts are up sharply versus last year, indicating a continuation of broad-based recovery in residential construction. In fact, most Vulcan-served states realized double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months. More importantly, we are seeing significant growth in key Vulcan-served states including Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. 7 of the top 10 states with the largest absolute growth in trailing 12-month housing starts at June 30 are Vulcan-served states, with Florida and Texas leading the way.","We also continue to be encouraged by leading indicators of future activity for private nonresidential construction. Contract awards, as measured by fee for private nonresidential construction, are up 11% in the U.S., with Texas and Florida leading the way here, too, up 51% and 43%, respectively. Growth in stores and office buildings, which for us includes all commercial, office and lodging, is the primary driver.","Growth in private construction activity in key Vulcan-served states like Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona, is important, because not only will we realize the attractive incremental margins that Danny referred to, from higher aggregates volumes, but our non-aggregates businesses in these markets will benefit as well.","Our year-to-date concrete shipments are indicative of this expanding recovery in residential and private nonresidential construction. Through the first 6 months of this year, our concrete shipments were up over 11% compared to the same period last year, again led by Texas and Florida which are up 36% and 23%, respectively. This growth in new private construction activity underpins our expectations for volumes and earnings improvements in 2013.","Looking now to Slide 12. Highways comprised the largest end market for aggregates demand within public construction. New highway projects, as measured by trailing 12-month contract awards, were up 1% versus the prior year's level, the second consecutive quarter with an increase.","This table on Slide 12 shows the positive contribution of recent awards to the current year, up 10% year-to-date versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of the stability brought to the state DOTs by the new federal highway bill passed by Congress in September of 2012.","More significant to us is the fact that contract awards for highways in our served markets are up 14% year-to-date, driven by contract awards for new road projects, which are more aggregates-intensive than any other type of construction. This recent growth provides some evidence that a more stable and predictable highway funding environment leads to improving construction activity.","The large increase in TIFIA funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact future demand. Contract awards for TIFIA projects are projected to add $30 billion to $50 billion to highway and infrastructure construction, substantially exceeding the contract awards for highways from the 2009 stimulus bill. Some TIFIA projects have already begun in 2013, but 2014 and '15 will be much more significant years in shipments to TIFIA projects.","The growth in new highway projects should help offset recent weakness in other public infrastructure, as shown here on this table. Last year, highways comprised approximately 30% of full year aggregates shipments while other public infrastructure accounted for less than half that amount.","Turning to our outlook on Slide 13. Our outlook for another year of operating earnings improvements remains on track, and is supported by improved pricing, continued growth in private construction activity, which should drive volume growth, and by disciplined cost management. U.S. construction employment through the first half of 2013 is up 2.8% from the prior year, an indication that construction activity is again growing, albeit from a low base.","Aggregates demand from private construction is expected to grow mid- to high-single digits overall, led by the residential segment.","Public construction in the second half of 2013 should begin benefiting from recent growth in contract awards for new highway projects, as well as from TIFIA funding, and these 2 items should create positive momentum in that sector going into 2014.","As we look specifically to the remainder of 2013, the projects that could materially impact our second half aggregates volumes continue to include a disproportionately greater number of large highway and industrial projects. The timing of shipments to these projects remains outside our control, and in some cases, has been delayed due to project considerations. Additionally, the wet weather experienced in the first half of this year could cause some project work to slow, resulting in backlog carryovers into 2014. As a result, we expect second half aggregate shipments to increase 2% to 4% from the prior year. This volume outlook assumes more normal weather patterns throughout the remainder of the year, and includes the effects of sales volumes associated with acquisitions and divestitures this year.","On a same-store basis, second half aggregate shipments are expected to increase 3% to 5%. In keeping with our successful efforts to offset the earnings effect of lower volumes in recent quarters, we continue our focus on reducing controllable cost and achieving improved pricing.","The geographic breadth of pricing gains achieved in 2012, and so far this year, reinforces our expectations for continued price growth for the second half. We expect full year freight-adjusted price growth of approximately 4% for full year 2013.","Additionally, earnings in each of our non-aggregate segments should improve compared to last year. Asphalt materials margins increased throughout 2012, and we expect material margins to continue to increase throughout 2013 and contribute to earnings growth in this segment.","Full year concrete volumes and material margins are expected to improve in 2013 as housing starts continue recovering in key states. Concrete volumes year-to-date have increased 11% overall versus the prior year due in part to increased private construction activity in Florida. We expect the increased private construction activity to continue to lead to improved unit profitability in the concrete segment.","Cement earnings should improve in 2013 due to higher shipments, improved pricing and lower production costs. As a result, collectively, full year earnings from these segments are expected to contribute significantly to earnings growth in 2013 as they have in the second quarter of this year.","Our full year outlook for 2013 reflects our continued progress toward achieving our Profit Enhancement Plan goals. Through the first half of 2013, we remain on track to meet our target of $100 million in improvement from the 2011 base year. Finally, we will continue to work on additional asset-related transactions that will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics, as well as redeploy capital and assets in markets with higher future returns to increase our ability to improve earnings as construction activity grows.","With that, I'll turn the program over to our operator to begin your questions. Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to responding to your questions.","Is the operator available? Well, bear with us a moment as we get the line open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned some pretty strong shipments in some of your key states and it suggests that in some other states you had probably a proportionate decline. So I was wondering, what do you think the disparity among the different regions says about the recovery and says about the outlook?","Donald M. James","Well, I think in the second quarter, it has, perhaps, more to do with the absence of large projects in Virginia and in Illinois and with bad weather. As Danny Shepherd says, those 2 markets were down significantly compared to prior year. Obviously, though, the states that were hit hardest in the downturn are the ones that are coming back very strong. Clearly, Florida, Arizona, California are doing very well now. Texas is doing extremely well. As you know, it didn't have quite the downturn that some of the other states have had. But clearly, as we've indicated, our business in Florida is coming back very strongly. It's coming back very strongly in Arizona. And California's coming back nicely, and Texas is very strong. The middle part of the country is still not as strong, even though we had a lot of wet weather in the east, particularly up the East Coast, as you can see from the map that's in the slides, we actually had volume growth in several of those states. But we know that we lost a lot of volume, particularly in those markets at high-margin volume in the quarter, which we're looking forward to capturing through the remainder of the year.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question was on -- in your -- the prepared statement and the press release, you talked about the historical relationship between nonresidential and how that follows residential construction. I was wondering how tight that is? And what -- based upon your experience, what the typical timing lag is for when you see -- you think the improvement in non-res after residential improvement?","Donald M. James","Well, we are students of economic cycles, and certainly, there is a cycle-after-cycle-after-cycle trend that residential leads nonresidential out of recession, usually with a 9-month, plus or minus, lag. As we look at the relationship now about housing starts contrasted to private non-res contract awards, we're seeing the same pattern develop. Housing starts have started up earlier, are more robust today, but private non-res is certainly recovering strongly based on contract awards. So we're, I think, cautiously optimistic that the pattern of prior recoveries in private construction led by residential, followed by private non-res is repeating itself.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Don, can you talk about how you see the public construction cycle playing out, just to continue the discussion on your last point. I guess in prior cycles, this is about the time we would see public construction start to bottom and turn the other way? And wondering if you'd just add some context based on tax receipts or other metrics that you look at for your key states on how you think that plays out?","Donald M. James","The relationship between public construction, particularly highways and private non-res, is certainly not as consistent. It's driven by different factors, largely by public spending. We're not looking for a substantial increase this year, in 2013, in shipments into public construction, we are looking for somewhat some growth in the highway sector, but then there's some offsetting weakness in other public infrastructure, water and sewer projects, things like that, which ought to, overtime, follow housing and private non-res construction. But the linkage is not nearly as consistent or as highly correlated as the relationship historically between housing construction and private non-res. That being said, the real wildcard here -- and we said that highway contract awards are up 10% the first half of this year compared to last year, which is clearly understandable. We didn't have a highway bill in the first half of 2012. We do have a federal highway bill, that's given stability and predictability to the states. And they started much bigger bid lettings in the first of the year based on the security of having a federal highway bill in place. But the big wildcard here of these TIFIA projects, I know you're tired of hearing us talk about those, but we're tracking about 50 or 55 big TIFIA projects in our markets. Some of those, as we said in our prepared text, have begun shipping in 2013, or will be shipping in 2013. But there's a big backlog of these projects. The Federal Highway Administration has been a little slower than anybody wanted in getting them approved and out, but they are beginning to show up. And they are going to have a very significant impact all across our footprint. I mean, I'm looking down my list, there's Illinois, Georgia, North Carolina, a lot in Virginia and Maryland and Florida, in Texas and in California. In addition to those, there are a lot of industrial projects, big industrial projects, primarily along the Gulf Coast, including refineries for Exxon and Chevron, LNG, the whole energy sector has got a big construction plan underway. And all of those things rolled up, give us lot of optimism -- give a lot of uncertainty as to the absolute level of volume in the second half of '13, but a tremendous amount of optimism about volume growth in '14 and '15.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Don, when you add up all the TIFIA projects that you're tracking, what's the aggregate dollar amount, how significant is that?","Donald M. James","We don't have -- well, the project value of the 56 projects we are tracking in our markets is $65 billion. And that -- I'm sorry, that's not all TIFIA, that's all large projects. Some of those are not TIFIA and some of them are private industrial. But our tracking sheet -- and we won't get every one of these projects and we won't get all the material in every one of these projects, but there is a pretty good backlog of big projects in our footprint.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you spoke about the weather element. Can you just step us through to what extent is that keeping you from being more aggressive on price increases, if at all? Does that impact what otherwise would have been stronger price increases into 3Q?","Donald M. James","I don't think so. I don't think weather -- weather has had an impact on volume, it's had an impact, as Danny Shepherd said, on our production cost. I don't think we can say it's had any impact at all on pricing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes, just losses in the concrete segment narrowing at a pretty nice pace here. Are you getting some confidence you'll start to see some profitability in that business next year as you look into the various markets you're exposed to? And sort of second part to that, are you actually profiting in some specific markets and maybe that's just being offset elsewhere?","Donald M. James","Yes and yes. We're -- volume growth is the key to -- one of the keys to profitability in the concrete business, and we are profitable in a number of our concrete markets. And we're unprofitable in some others. So it's -- but we will, overall, with particularly recovery in the private sector construction where a lot of our concrete goes, we are -- we're very happy with that. And concrete, the improvement in our profitability of our cement segment also has been very substantial. And those are clearly related because our concrete is pulling aggregates through our system as well as cement through our system.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","That's encouraging. And as these larger public jobs eventually come through for you, I guess, everything else equal, should that have positive implications for your price mix?","Donald M. James","Absolutely. A little volume momentum in this industry has very significant pricing and margin leverage. Danny Shepherd had a slide in the presentation which I think would indicate that. If you look at the margin expansion, we experienced driven -- while it's not 1 for 1 in timing, it certainly is an indicator of opportunities for margin expansion. Both in pricing, but also in terms of our cost of production. Being able to run our plants at efficient volume levels really does move the needle on cost.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Maher from Singular Research.","Keith Maher - Singular Research","Question about -- would you ever consider doing an equity offering to improve your capital structure by paying down some of the debt?","Donald M. James","Yes.","Keith Maher - Singular Research","Okay. Any thoughts on when that may occur or how serious you are about doing that?","Donald M. James","We continue to look at various options for improving our balance sheet. The options we have are improving our EBITDA, which we clearly are doing and are very focused on doing. Assets, sales of nonstrategic assets is another way, and equity offering is yet another way. So we -- everything is on the table for us in terms of improving our balance sheet.","Keith Maher - Singular Research","Okay, great. And on CapEx, I think your guidance for the year was $150 million. It looks like you spent $60 million. Do you think you'll come in under that number, and is that mainly just for maintenance and not capacity expansions?","Donald M. James","Most of that $150 million would be for replacement CapEx. We have spent, as I indicated, over the last 12 months, we have made acquisitions totaling about $111 [ph] million. So we're in the -- continue to do bolt-on transactions. We are also very interested, as part of our asset sales, in continuing to improve our portfolio of businesses and geographies. The -- however you measure it, cash margin per ton may be one way to measure. But the assets we've sold have a dramatically lower cash margin per ton than the assets we're buying. So we are very focused on being in the right markets with the right set of assets. And that's part of our ongoing strategy, which you will be -- you've seen played out over the last 12 months and I think you'll continue to see being played out over the next 12.","Keith Maher - Singular Research","Okay, do you have any target level for acquisitions and divestitures this year, just in terms of dollars or capacity?","Donald M. James","No. We did announce that our goal was to achieve $500 million of after-tax proceeds, pretax proceeds from divestitures. We continue to look at opportunities. We're not going to sell good assets cheaply, but we may have some assets that are more valuable to other players than they are to us. If we can find those opportunities to withdraw our capital from those non-strategic assets and reinvest them either in debt reduction or in other bolt-on acquisitions, primarily aggregates-focused, we'll continue to do that.","Operator","We will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Don James.","Donald M. James","Well, thank you, all, for being with us today. Given the weather, we are very pleased with the second quarter. I hope you are. We look forward to a positive report at the end of the third quarter, and we will talk to you then. Thank you so much.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

My name is Laura and I will be your conference coordinator today. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. Additionally, today's call is being recorded.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide, we will focus on the highlights. We hope this approach will provide more time to respond to your questions.","With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.","Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now I'd like to turn the call over Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, Mark. Thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We'll keep our remarks fairly brief today since we discussed many of the key business trends and our outlook just a few weeks ago during our Aggregates Day event in Atlanta.","Looking at the third quarter and our recent performance, four main points stand out. First, we obviously saw shipments declined in the third quarter. However, to my second point, we see it as localized, not cyclical. Third, our profitability continues to grow. And fourth, our prospects for sustained growth remain very exciting.","Let me address each in just a little more detail. First, we obviously have seen a drop in year-over-year shipments. This is due in part to a period of relative weakness and new construction starts across much of our footprint. It's also due to weather and other location-specific factors, impacting our business in California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois. Third quarter year-over-year shipments in these four states were down 15% collectively.","Now in stark contrast, our other markets experienced combined year-over-year shipment growth of 6%, and in fact, several markets saw strong double-digit growth to the order of 12% to 21%. Second and importantly, we continue to view these volume headwinds as temporary or a transitional lull in a multiyear recovery that is still intact and sound and actually with a long way to run.","To this point, the variation in results across our footprint reveals volume challenges that are clearly localized rather than cyclical. Notably, our daily aggregate shipment rate increased from August to September and from September to October with October exceeding the prior year period by about 3%.","In addition, according to Dodge reports, trailing 12-month construction starts showed sequential improvements in both August and September, picking up from a noticeable slowdown in March that lingered all the way through July. In short, the fundamental foundational drivers of a multiyear recovery remain firmly in place.","To point number three. Our core profit engine remains very powerful. We're on track to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA this year, and this is despite volumes that are below our original expectations. In our aggregates segment, third quarter freight-adjusted selling prices were 7% ahead of third quarter 2015, and gross profit per ton rose 9%. For the 12 months ended in September, gross profit per ton has increased 25%. The flow through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue into incremental gross profit has exceeded 80%.","Also for the 12 months ended September, the total business delivered net earnings of $371 million and $981 million of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 27%. This is an improvement of 430 basis points over the prior year.","Fourth and finally, we remain excited about our long range growth prospects. We are well on track to achieve our profitability goals. And near-term, we like the volume, pricing and profitability momentum we see for 2017. We also like the very robust pipeline of projects that we see building for 2018 and 2019.","Now John will share a few thoughts regarding our current momentum and outlook in a minute, but first I'll offer a bit more insight into how our business has been performing across our footprint. As we discussed during our Aggregates Day in Atlanta, the recent demand climate has made it a little hard to distinguish the signal from the noise.","For example, there has been clear accelerating growth in the longer-term project pipeline. The impact of the federal highway bill, the FAST Act, and higher state level funding are beginning to show up in the mix. At the same time, there has been a softening in the rate at which this water behind the dam has been released in the form of construction starts.","There was also a lull in state highway spending during the first half of the year and this was as states work their way through the remainder of a fiscal year that did not include new FAST Act points (07:06). Notably, this has now started to turn in a positive direction. The latest OTMA (07:15) report on highway contract awards shows them increasing by 30% in September. And this is the second consecutive month of growth following weak contract award activity during the first half of the year.","Looking closely, this isn't too surprising as many states have entered a new fiscal year with the FAST Act money flowing into their pipelines and a backlog of projects ready to go.","During the slowdown period early this year, a number of markets saw adverse weather conditions, shortages in skilled labor and other factors that have constrained the rate at which existing construction projects could be completed. A number of our customers have found it difficult to catch up in the near-term on work deferred due to bad weather earlier in the year.","Generally speaking, our operations across the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states continue to post solid gains in volumes despite these challenges. Florida, Georgia and North Carolina enjoyed robust double-digit volume growth to the tune of 12% to 21%, and this was accompanied by strong pricing and unit margin performance. Now Virginia on the other hand is an example of a market where we're seeing good pricing momentum, although volume momentum hasn't picked up yet.","Turning to Texas and California. Shipment levels in these states remain challenged in the third quarter. This was below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Shipments in Texas were down 21% in the quarter. This was driven in part by Coastal Texas shipments which were down 27%. All of Texas was impacted by bad weather throughout the quarter, most notably in August. Business in North and South Texas fell off accordingly from what would otherwise have been a much stronger performance in those areas. Houston and the Coast, however, in addition to the well-known downturn in the oil and gas industry and extensive flooding also experienced a delay in TxDOT work.","So, when we talk about Texas and volume declines, it is, in fact, largely isolated to the coastal area of the state, separating out statewide weather impacts. But despite a transitory period of volume headwinds, there is ongoing pricing momentum in Texas and it simply highlights the underlying confidence and continued growth in the Lone Star State. At the same time, our core profitability, which has also been strong, keeps improving. The bottom line is that, overall, we expect continued recovery in Texas market.","In California, shipments were down 17% from last year's quarter. We continue to see a slowdown in large project work in public and private sectors. This is work we are well positioned to serve. Caltrans also continued to grapple with highway funding related to diminished excise taxes. This created a bigger slowdown in project work than anticipated. We have reason to believe that political leaders will ultimately reach agreement on new state funding measures for California roads, which are rated the worst in the U.S.","Putting it all together, we expect to see a return in 2017 to a pattern of recovery and growth in California. Our sales force is aligned to take advantage of these growth opportunities. Large projects are getting back on track. The pipeline of major projects continues to get bigger and bigger. Construction starts are back on the upswing and there will ultimately be improvements in state funding for roads along with local highway improvement initiatives.","In fact, we're already seeing early signs of improvement. Highway contract awards in California were up 98% in September as these new FAST Act funds are starting to flow into the system. Underlying these facts are fundamental strengths. In our California business as well as Texas, our core profitability continues to improve. And in California, as in Texas, despite the lull in shipments, pricing has remained strong, in the high single-digits, underscoring the basic confidence in the trajectory of California markets.","Across our company, our focus on core profit improvements, the little things that make us better every day, is keeping us on track towards our longer-term goals and you see it in our results.","Now I'll hand it over to John for some brief additional comments regarding our outlook for 2016 and the momentum we see heading into 2017.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everybody. I'd like to touch quickly on a few points regarding our forward outlook, but let me first note that our views have not changed meaningfully from those that we communicated during our late September event in Atlanta.","First, and as Tom noted, we continue to project $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2016. And due to continued gains in unit profitability and overall margins, we think we can reach the low end of our beginning-of-year guidance range despite shipments falling well below our original forecast.","Now, to put this outlook into some context, let's take a look at results and trends, particularly with respect to our improved profitability over the trailing 12 months. As you heard Tom say and as you've seen in our release, during that period, we generated net earnings of $371 million and adjusted EBITDA of $981 million. But behind that, it's important to note that our average freight-adjusted selling prices in our aggregates segment have increased 8% over that time. Our average gross profit per ton has increased 25% over that time, and our overall gross profit as a percent of freight-adjusted revenue for the company has risen from 34% to 39%.","As we consistently call out, fourth quarter results can be impacted significantly by weather and the effective length of the construction season and our strong results from Q4 of 2015 present tough comparisons. But our improved core profitability should be sufficient to allow us to reach our stated goals for 2016 if recent shipment momentum holds up through the quarter.","Now turning to 2017. I'll begin by reiterating that it remains too early for us to give specific or firm guidance. We're primarily focused on finishing the current year strong and we're just at the beginning of our internal planning cycle for next year. But from what we can see today, from the data we see today, we expect continued volume recovery in 2017 along with further improvements in pricing and overall margins. In other words, continued progress on track with the longer range goals we've outlined previously.","With respect to volumes, and again, we're not yet in a position to share specific numbers, we currently expect growth in each of our primary end use segments next year, residential, private non-res, highways and other public infrastructure. And we also expect to see broad-based growth across our geographic footprint and growth in substantially all of our key market areas.","We've noted that construction start data points have recently turned back up after several months of softening. And highway contract awards in our key states have also turned up recently. And on top of that, longer-term project pipelines continue to strengthen from our already strong levels. But the relative start weakness we've experienced earlier this year combined with strong first quarter 2016 comparisons suggest that 2017's volume growth on a year-over-year basis could be back half loaded.","We expect the pricing climate to remain positive and constructive for 2017. The strength of longer-term project pipelines and significant increases in dedicated public transportation funding reinforce confidence in a sustained recovery. And materials producers and others in the construction supply chain remain focused on earning adequate returns on capital. Competition remains intense, but overall and generally speaking, we're battling over value and not just volume.","Given these dynamics, we'd expect our free cash flow profile and overall financial condition to strengthen further next year. We should have the financial capacity and the flexibility needed to support reinvestment in our franchise, growth including but not limited to M&A, as well as additional returns of capital to shareholders.","Tom, back over to you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, John. We're pleased with the continued strong earnings growth and margin expansion we saw in the third quarter despite lower shipment levels. The drivers of recovery in shipments remain very much in place. Our core profitability continues to improve and our fundamental outlook for the future of the business remains unchanged.","Given that positive outlook, I can assure you that we will invest in our business accordingly. We will keep investing internally. For example, we will plow about $125 million into internal growth projects this year. These projects will help us serve our customers better, increase efficiencies and add to the bottom line. They include five new rail yards, three in Texas, one in Charleston, South Carolina, and another one in Savannah, Georgia along with six greenfield sites that's new quarries, that we're developing in growth markets across the country.","At the same time, we will continue to aggressively pursue bolt-on acquisitions in key markets as well as other strategic acquisitions, all of which will further strengthen our leading position in the industry.","I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their commitment to improving every day, to working safely, to finishing this year strong and to delivering another year of even stronger results. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.","And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Really just want to focus on certain geographies and I know that you gave some color in your prepared comments, I just want to dig a little bit deeper. First on California, a lot of their budget with Caltrans has been tied to gas prices. Do we see gas prices move up? How has that impacted your conversations with Caltrans regarding the budget? Also, when you look at the volume softness in that state, how much of it was large project delays versus the budget related issues which seem to be(19:52) apparently tied together, or any other relevant factor that we should take into consideration?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Kathryn. I think \u2013 let me just kind of comment on California overall. I think we feel optimistic about demand in California. We see sustained strength in residential and kind of smaller private work. And the headwinds that we faced this year shouldn't repeat next year. If you look at the pipeline data, start data and listen to our customers, we feel better about California even though we haven't seen the shipments come back yet. And we feel good about the public funding situation in California. The elements are in place for this to come together for state funding. You got to remember that California still has the worst roads in the country even with a little bit of increase in the gas taxes from (20:43) price. We'll start to see the FAST Act start kicking in and then we saw a August redistribution of federal funds at just under $ 0.25 billion to California. And then you've got, as you know, you've got the local initiatives that are on the ballot for next week that if they all pass would total about $2.5 billion annually. So, for us in California, as we say, it's not if, it's really about pace and probably the pace of large projects. So I think we're feeling pretty good about 2017 and the longer-term outlook is pretty bright for California.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you. And then on Illinois, that state has been a little tougher when you think about just kind of the state from \u2013 not only from the public side but also from a private sector spending. How should we think about...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I think...","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","...Illinois and as we go forward?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think that's a real contrast to California where we feel like California's fundamentals are really good and coming back very strong. Illinois is a weak spot for us and it's really about public funding. The private side is actually not too bad in Illinois, but the public side is just going to be tough for us. I would say this much. Even with volumes down, I'm proud of our team in Illinois. They have \u2013 their profitability is up and facing some pretty good headwinds.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Kathryn, just to add a little bit of color on those two states, I think it's instructive to contrast Illinois and California a little bit. Illinois, for us, the business is doing quite well as Tom said. There's actually some green shoots in their funding, some toll road funding, some other funding that's not as dependent on the overall public sources. As you probably know, there are some efforts to, if you will, protect transportation funding from other needs in the state. But Illinois is the one place we called out where we just don't see the path to long-term growth that we see in the rest of our footprint. If we contrast that with California which, yes, is going through a little bit of a lull right now, particularly on some large public funding, even the outlook next year for California is quite bright and we see growth in California in 2017 and beyond.","And so those are very different situations in our view. One which is doing well and profitable but doesn't right now have the long-term growth visibility. California is quite different. Yes, as you know quite well, Caltrans is challenged with some of their funding this year. Yes, that impacts us disproportionately because of our large asphalt presence and the customers we really lined up to serve well. But we don't expect to see anything like the same headwinds next year that we've seen this year in California. And I'd also just remind you, just to give you a sense of that visibility and how it plays out in the marketplace, our pricing in California is up nearly double-digits. So very different situation between those two states.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thanks. That was a good segue for my next question just for the consolidated aggregate pricing in the quarter. How much was product mix and\/or geographic mix impacting total average price of the quarter?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","There was an impact from geographic mix, probably just under 1%, negative impact.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Kathryn, a lot of that is \u2013 think of how much our business in a place like Coastal Texas was down and that's one of our higher priced markets, and that \u2013 even that by itself had a significant impact on total pricing for the business.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then finally, just more broadly speaking, would love to get your thoughts or color on are you starting to see FAST Act dollars flow through these states and how much was that a contributor to strength in the markets that did have solid growth?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think that you're starting to see FAST Act dollars flow through in lettings. I don't think they've flown through to shipments yet. And I think you'll start to see that in the first, second quarter, probably second quarter of 2017. But so we're backlogging jobs right now that are in the letting. The lettings are picking up because of FAST Act spending, but I don't think we've seen much of that get into shipments yet.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, not into shipments. But we saw \u2013 we began to see a real uptick as several state DOTs turned into their new fiscal year. And we are seeing some of that FAST Act money, as Tom noted, begin to be more aggressively allocated, including a reallocation of funds to California that happened just recently. So the money is getting put to use, but we really haven't seen it impact our actual aggregate shipments very much yet at all.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Great.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Provides visibility for pricing, so it's probably a positive on pricing but not a big impact yet on shipments.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll turn to Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","I guess quick question on one of the comments you had in the prepared remarks about October. I think you mentioned that it was trending up kind of around 3%. First, was that pretty broad-based across your enterprise? Or was it more geographically isolated to certain markets driving that improvement?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","It was pretty broad-based. We're still facing some challenges as we said in California, but other than that and a little bit of weather on the East Coast, it was broad-based. And I think that what you're seeing there is some of the projects starting to come through, both res and non-res, and that'll pick up as we move into 2017.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Trey, just for a little more color for you all \u2013 and as Tom says, obviously very broad-based. But just to clarify a little bit further, it has bounced back in Texas. It has not, as Tom said, bounced back yet in California. Although as we just discussed, we see a lot of positive signs for next year in California. If you took California out or if California were flat, that 3% up number would be up 5% to 6%. I'm just trying to give you a feel for how broad-based in relative strength ex-California.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So California's still a little bit soft in October for us. Again, we see a lot of positive signs, but it's taking a while to flow through. Texas is already rebounding, and you'll get a feel for what the rest of it adds up to. So \u2013 now to be clear, when we say that's daily shipment rate \u2013 again, to give you all a feel, we're shipping a little more than 800,000 tons per shipping day.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And I just want to be clear now so that doesn't get misinterpreted, that's per shipping day. So we had 21 shipping days in October. It's not per calendar day, if you will.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","I got you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","But that'll give you a feel for how much a week longer or week shorter construction season can also have in the fourth quarter for us.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Sure. Okay. That's super helpful. And then I guess with that being said, I don't know if with October behind us now, at the Analyst Day, you said you guys are going to have trouble hitting the 190 million tons of the original guidance that you had. So, with October behind us now, with the third quarter and October behind us I guess, can you help us tighten up that volume range for the year at all as far as kind of how we should be thinking about it if we get, I guess, normal weather in November and December? Anything more granular we can get there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think as always, as you know, the fourth quarter is about weather and timing and the number of workdays we'll have will be important. Will our customers have enough wherewithal to get the work done in those days? I think that the demand is there. We're seeing the projects coming. Our customers have \u2013 really want to get the work done because they see what's coming in 2017. So the work is there. The desire is there. It's just it's always about timing, and can you get it all done in the number of days you've got left in the year. John?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Trey, just to give you a number, given some of those capacity constraints with our customers just getting the work done, we're probably looking at, we'd guess, 182 million tons to 184 million tons, in terms of millions of tons for the year.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Perfect.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And again, keep in mind, there's a lot of variability around that. Again, we're shipping 800,000 tons a day right now. So \u2013 but to answer your question, that's probably what we're looking toward. And at those levels, we think we're still in line with the overall EBITDA guidance we've given.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And my last one is more I guess kind of looking into next year. Directionally, you've talked about volume and price just very broadly and directionally, which I get why you don't want to go into any more detail with that yet. But can you give us, as far as like gross profit per ton and how we should be kind of thinking about that, even if it's just directionally as we look into next year, given the fact that we're expecting volume growth, we're expecting pricing growth, but any geographic mix that could impact and without the tailwind maybe as much on diesel, just how to think about your broad thoughts on gross profit per ton next year.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I'll start with price. We continue to see a really healthy environment for price, and that's driven not just by demand but really about the visibility that our customers and the market sees with the pipeline that's coming. The majority of our markets have already announced price increases for our fixed plant work. Those will be effective anywhere from January 1 to April 1, and if you just kind of look at the price without putting the markets beside, as we've announced price increases, and I'm just looking at a list of $1, $1.50, $0.75, $1, $0.50, $1.75, $1.25, $1, $1, so healthy price increases. Timing will vary with that. I would tell you, at this point, when we look at it, it's pretty generally accepted in the markets and the markets are healthy with that and all of that's driven by that visibility and confidence in that pipeline that's growing. So that'll give you some kind of idea of what we're seeing on pricing out there. When it comes to cost, I think our folks are doing a really good job managing costs and the operating efficiencies that drive those costs, at the same time, keeping our people safe and volume will only help that.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Good luck, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Trey, just to \u2013 for everybody, we don't \u2013 there's nothing that we see on the cost side that would throw us kind of off track on recent trend on improving profitability, whether that's flow throughs well above 60%, whether that's our ability to get operating leverage in the system and leverage each step in the P&L, and certainly as we finish off our planning cycle internally, which again, we're just beginning, as you know, we focus quite a bit internally on our profit per ton one market at a time. So I guess we'd be quite surprised if our profit per ton didn't continue to grow a good bit faster than pricing alone would indicate.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Good deal. It's encouraging. Thanks a lot.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Next up is Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question, you mentioned Illinois, I know you have a Safe Roads Amendment coming out. Assuming it passes, is \u2013 when would one \u2013 I guess when would you start to see money flow through from a project perspective? And then, two, I mean is that only thing or what else do you need to see in the crystal ball to help that piece of the market recover? Because generally speaking, it looks like the other markets in the portfolio are going to do pretty well next year.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I think what that really does is not new funding or additional funding, it's protecting the funding that's there which is important. Because in Illinois, those funds have been rated in the past, and so it just protects it or safeguards it which is important and a good thing. Illinois, for the public side, they just got to fix some of their funding issues. As John and I said earlier, we don't see that happening for 2017. It's going to take a while. But the private side is still going pretty good in Illinois.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Stanley, we don't want to give the impression that Illinois is like in some kind of freefall. It's stabilized at lower level. We just don't see the same kind of longer-term growth fundamentals yet in place that we see in \u2013 really I'm trying to give other exceptions. But across the vast majority of the rest of our footprint, you hear us \u2013 if I contrast it with California again, you hear us talk about things, and you know how this works, population growth, employment growth, state of public revenues, so forth and so on. In a place like California, that story is still very positive. In a place like Illinois, it's less clear. So I don't want to give the impression that it's in some kind of freefall. The business is doing quite well as Tom said. Our team there is doing quite well, but we don't have the same view to one, two, three, four, five-year growth that we have elsewhere.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, that's fair. I was just trying to see if there was any sort of inflection point coming up to where it could kind of get a little bit more back on track, but very helpful. And secondly...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We're hoping the negative inflection point is behind us.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Well, you know what at some point, I think you're exactly right. But could you help us with \u2013 you mentioned the cost side being favorable. Can you talk a little bit about the enhanced sales initiatives that you mentioned in the press release?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. And again, that's just an area of an investment in the business. As we see long-term growth in the businesses, as we're very focused on providing better service to our customers, to be more valuable to our customers and to get full value for our product, we are continuing to invest in some of our sales support systems, customer support systems, people. Really nothing out of the ordinary, Stanley.","Those can be just very important investments to support growth and important to customers' needs. And they tie back to a strategy that's very focused on earning full and fair value for our product. And as such, we need to be providing full service to our customers.","So, for a lot of our customers a lot of the time, we are more than just a material supplier, and we want to make sure that as the markets recover, as things get busier, as they face their own constraints, that we're in a position to help them be successful. That's how we're successful.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, to add to that, I think we're seeing what's coming in the next four, five years with growth in all market segments. In order to do that, we need to invest in the sales group so we can add value for our customers and be ahead of that growth curve.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sounds good. And last question for me. On a lot of these internal initiatives, how should we think about whether it's in terms of payback or kind of hurdle rates, anything that you would care to share about all the growth investments that you have going on internally? Thanks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I think this is normal part of our growth. We just don't grow through acquisitions, and this is about protecting and adding value to the franchises that we have. So greenfields are normal projects for us, whether that is distribution of rail or bluewater or new quarries. They take a long time to develop, and you've got to get out ahead of the growth curve. But these are normal projects for us and well above the cost of capital.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","They're actually generally quite attractive, Stanley. As you can imagine, and you know enough about our unit economics, about our margins. We're really doing these kinds of things in markets that we're already in, particularly in a risk-adjusted basis. These are good investments, and we're quite happy to have the financial flexibility to invest in that growth.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Agreed. Best of luck, guys. Thanks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Now we'll move to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hey, Timna.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Not to hammer home, but on the Q4 commentary, I was a little bit confused because you talk about if the shipment momentum continues then you're on track to meet guidance. But I thought that October was the usually strongest quarter. So do you mean that adjusted for that seasonality if shipment continues? Or what did you mean by that, and if you could just clarify?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think what we're saying there is we're seeing those jobs pick up that we've been talking about and starting to come through. We feel good about the fourth quarter as always. You've got a limited number of days to work through particularly as you get towards the winter months. And so, if not, I don't think it's \u2013 we're seeing the work there, and we're seeing the projects as a matter of constraints for our customers to get it done or number of working days.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. That makes sense.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Timna, unless something odd happened and shortened the construction season by a lot, we'd expect to be, just be clear, on track with our $1 billion of expected adjusted EBITDA for the year.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We're not trying to send any weird signal on that just to be clear. It's the same message as we delivered in Atlanta.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Helpful. In the past, you've talked a little bit about your utilization and talked about raising that utilization and what the incremental costs might be and characterized them. Is that something you can update us on?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, if I understand the question correctly, Timna, this is John, and Tom will chime in of course, but from a plant utilization point of view, if that's your question, we are still \u2013 the vast majority of our facility is well below what we would kind of call sweet spots of operation. So we have a lot of operating leverage in front of us.","Probably like others in our business, as we've started the recovery and started to ramp back up production, we've had to work through some periods of higher \u2013 particularly maintenance cost, showed up first in mobile equipment. Now shows up a little bit for us this quarter in our business and takes plant or processing equipment. This is you running things harder and getting them ready for future growth. But to a question that was asked earlier, we should be very well set up to continue to deliver really good operating leverage in what's still largely a fixed cost business for quite a while to come. There will be moments in time where our local operators are wrestling with, and this is obviously a good problem to have, how to add a shift or add a crew and do that most efficiently, most safely, most economically. But if you step back from it and you think about our improved margin structures, you'd think about our incremental flow throughs, the conditions are in place for those numbers to still be quite attractive for quite some time.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, we've got plants that are still running part-time. Even with the volumes that we've seen come back, we're nowhere near optimal operating leverage or efficiencies in these plants. So our operating people are really happy about the volume improvements with the exception of maybe Texas where we're running some plants. We've got lots of run room ahead of us, and I think it will be fun to watch this over the next two or three years.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And while we had a couple of headwinds this quarter, our teams have kept operating costs over the trailing 12 months effectively flat which is a really good accomplishment given the ups and downs in the production side.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So are we talking 60%, 65% still, utilization?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I mean, probably \u2013 every market's different. Demand, different plants when you run them, but yeah, that's where you're talking about.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then final one for me, John. I know I like to harp on this, but you got that high quality problem of a low dividend yield. Is it fair to assume that the next review by the board would be in February and not before then? And are we just going to continue to grow with the company? Or are we going to start to express some of the greater earnings power that you like to talk about?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, obviously the board \u2013 let me first say it's a board decision, so I don't want to preview their decision. Obviously reviewed every board meeting. If our past pattern holds true, we'd be announcing something in February.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Again, that's if past pattern holds true. I don't want to prejudge the board's decision. But nothing to our knowledge has changed from our past communications which is, we would expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings throughout the recovery period. And of course, we're very focused long-term on having a sustainable dividend. But really nothing changed, Timna, and February is probably the most likely date.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Again, I don't want to prejudge the board, but that's probably the most likely date.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll move to Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just have a follow-up question on pricing, how we should think about that moving into 2017, provided some color around mix and some of the percent in dollar increase announcements that you have already scheduled for 2017. But if we're to think about the volume growth as potentially back half weighted to next year given the tough comps in the first quarter, given just the timing around state budgets and how funding is going to flow through on the infrastructure side, should we think about the pricing growth opportunity in 2017 as back half weighted as well?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think, as always, what I was giving you in the price increases was fixed plant pricing which will \u2013 timing will all be different, but those will kick in. But you've got to remember, a lot of pricing for our work is bid work where we're quoting one job at a time, and that'll be a campaign. So you'll see gradual price increases in those markets as you are able to raise prices throughout the year. So I don't see anything different in the cadence of pricing as we got coming up versus prior years. The one thing I would tell you is that the environment for pricing and the acceptance of it is very good.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one last question on asphalt, good performance in the quarter despite some challenging volume conditions in California. But if we're thinking about asphalt and the oil prices and potential inflation on the cost side into 2017, how should we start to think about asphalt margins in that backdrop?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think it's one of those where when \u2013 as you see inflation in liquids, you will also see price increases, and I think our folks do a really good job of managing \u2013 creating value for our customers with cost improvements and managing costs along with margin management and material margin management. So my view of that is if you see increases in liquid, could it have a very short-term impact? Yes, as you work off oil work. But overall, the pricing will follow it.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Garik, we don't, from a financial management point of view, we don't have a lot of long-term exposure or anything like that on the liquids side. So it's more a short-term fluctuation in material margins. As you would well know, Garik, material margins in asphalt are just inherently a little more volatile than they would be, for example, in the aggregate side of the business. But they're also generally pretty attractive through a cycle and you get good returns on the capital through the cycle. So we like that part of our business. Now it's tied in to our aggregates franchise, but we very much like that part of our business.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think the other thing I'd add to that is you're going to see pretty good demand increases in Asphalt, particularly as the public funding starts to flow through. You'll see a lot more highway jobs which will improve the demand, which will \u2013 and our customers in the market see that visibility. They know what's coming. So I think we're pretty optimistic on the profitability with asphalt, despite what happens with liquid, even if that hits us a little bit short-term. Longer-term, I'm pretty pleased with where the asphalt's going.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks so much and good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll next move to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is actually Marshall (46:32) on for Bob this morning.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Marshall (46:34).","Unknown Speaker","How're you all doing?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good.","Unknown Speaker","You already touched on the dividend. But it looks like you also pretty aggressively bought back some stock in the quarter, and I don't think that any of you all have really sold anything meaningfully. Maybe if you could just tie that to where you see the stock now and the outlook for the business through 2017 and beyond.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Marshall (46:56), this is John. I'll start. Yeah, I don't know if I would use words like aggressive or not, but we bought back 790,000 shares in the quarter. We've bought back a little over 1.4 million shares for the year. As we've said and this is just consistent with the capital allocation priorities we discussed many times, we'll continue to look to return excess cash after a variety of other priorities to shareholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases. We reserve the right to turn that on, turn that off. We'll report to you kind of after the fact.","We're always judging that use of capital relative to M&A and growth investments. And as Tom mentioned, we think we will have some interesting M&A opportunities over time, although they're difficult to predict and we're still active in that marketplace. And we do think of it as both an investment and as a return of capital. So, look, would we be doing it at those levels if we didn't think it was a good investment? No, if that's your question. We think it's a good use of capital. And again, we'll continue to report out on future actions after they occur.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I think we still see a good outlook both for, as we talked about, the internal investments and growing our business with new quarries and new distribution. But also, the market out there for acquisitions is good. We're working on a number of those. We hope to have some of those to talk about soon, so the growth opportunities in the business are very good.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Marshall (48:40), just to \u2013 maybe to answer your question a little more directly. Our fundamental outlook on the business has not changed. In fact, we have a lot of confidence in the profit engine and where that's taken. And a lot of the fundamentals regarding long-term demand recovery, if anything, are more in place now than they were when we had our Investor Day roughly a year-and-a-half, not quite two years ago. So, if you believe those conditions, then in our view, putting some additional capital back into our stock is a good investment. So it's not exclusive of other things we'll do with capital, but we think it's a good use of capital.","Operator","Anything further, sir?","Unknown Speaker","That's it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hill for any additional and closing remarks.","J.

My name is Kayla, and I will be a conference call coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark Warren","Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, President and CEO, and John McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.","Please note a slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks by Management and is available via the webcast. A copy of this presentation as well as a replay of the conference call will be available following the conclusion of this call at the Company's website.","Before we begin, I refer you to slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the Company's SEC reports including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call Management will refer to certain Non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us today. Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter.","As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet weather and serious flooding impeding construction activity in many parts of the US. In spite of these challenges, we operated safely, served our customers well and delivered strong results. The metrics and slides we'll talk about today are largely the same as in prior quarters. We are on track to have a very good year. Our focus hasn't changed and neither has our optimism regarding continued performance improvement. Construction activity and materials demand continue to recover.","Pricing momentum is accelerating, and our employees are doing a really good job converting incremental revenues into incremental profits. Despite the bad weather in many of our markets we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring our confidence in our full-year outlook. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on slide 4, adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations were $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $0.30 from the prior year. Although overall average shipments were lower than expected due to weather, we continue to see expanding gross profit margins and expanding EBITDA margins.","As you can see, overall gross profit margins increased by more than 450 basis points. These strong margins were supported by robust pricing momentum. We experienced strong earnings growth in aggregates and in each of our non-aggregate segment. This was also accompanied by declining SAG costs as a percent of sales.","In spite of the weather challenges, our people did an outstanding job taking incremental revenue to the bottom line. As we've noted before, our local teams across our footprint are doing a great job managing sales and production mix along with pricing. At the same time, we continue to reap the benefits of improving operating efficiencies and resulting leverage. Total gross profit increased 34%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 33%. Same-store shipments increased 5%, and same-store pricing increased over 6% with strong pricing momentum across most markets. Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit.","Now, let's look at the monthly trend of our aggregate shipments and the impact of weather on slide 5. Rain in the second quarter reduced the number of available shipping days in key markets, and it certainly postpone shipments. Slide 5 shows the year-over-year change in monthly shipments. You can see the impact of rain on shipments in April and May up only 5% and 2% on a same-store basis. In April, it was pervasive across most markets with above average rainfall in 13 of our states. In May, severe wet weather affected plant operations and construction activity in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.","In June, with the important exceptions of Illinois and Virginia the weather allowed for more normal days of construction activity, and shipments were robust revealing again the momentum and demand. The map on Slide 6 shows a breakdown of 5% growth in aggregate shipments across the country on a same-store basis. Even with all the wet weather the vast majority of our states experienced healthy growth.","Momentum in shipments continue with solid growth in key states, same-store shipments in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia saw shipments growth ranging from 5% to 11%. Although California volumes were down 3%, due to several large projects that had been delayed until the second half of the year, our full-year outlook for shipments growth in California remains unchanged. In our view and that of our customers' this is demand deferred not lost.","I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 7, aggregates pricing. As we've discussed before, pricing growth tends to lag volume growth. We experienced in the second quarter the initial stages of this improving pricing momentum.","We are pleased with the nice increase in freight adjusted aggregates price of 6.4% in the second quarter, and we fully expect to see pricing accelerate. This is supported by the confidence we see in our customers' view of the markets. We had nine major markets where price increases ranged from $0.60 to $1.20 and another three approaching the $0.50 range. In limited instances where we didn't see such robust pricing it was a function of product mix. We experienced much larger shipments of basin pines on new construction and large projects especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Growing volume in basin pines may detract from price but improves overall profitability.","Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices are initiated and as we finish older jobs. At this point, we also expect second half price increases to exceed 8%. Pricing momentum for Vulcan will continue. We are focused on earning a good return on the significant investments that we in this industry make on behalf of our customers.","We talk a lot about the three profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits, because they are important. On Slide 8 you can see that our second-quarter and trailing 12 month gross profit per ton increased 21% and 23% respectively. So in the quarter, price was up $0.71 per ton, but gross profit margin was up $0.76 per ton. Our sales and operations team continue to do an outstanding job turning demand into higher profitability. Nobody in the business does a better job of managing the combination of price, operating inefficiencies, volume and products. We continue to be excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion for Vulcan. It's not a new story.","As you can see, on Slide 9 we have now seen eight consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013 our gross profit per ton has increased sharply, and we are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations we're producing twice the volume.","In the most recent quarter we saw an increase in repair maintenance and labor costs. This is not surprising. Growing volumes are requiring us to run our operations longer resulting in more repairs, and wet weather negatively impacts labor inefficiencies. This is something that we will be managing very carefully even as we see pricing momentum and continued unit margin expansion that more than offsets these costs. Even though we are still in the early stages of recovery, we are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for our products continues to escalate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth.","Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the second quarter was 74% excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $44 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $59 million.","Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 61% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted by acquisition accounting and weather. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12 month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 72% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $157 million on incremental revenues of $219 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John for additional comments regarding our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?","John McPherson","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11 which effectively serves as capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this Slide, we summarize the improvement in our aggregate segment results since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013.","Before the recovery began, our annualized aggregates volumes troughed at 140 million tons. That was two years ago. As of the quarter just ended our trailing 12 month shipments are 170 million tons. So we've added 30 million tons of aggregate shipments on an annualized basis. This gain reflects a sustained early recovery but remains well below the shipments we'd expect under normal demand conditions.","Now, importantly we've been able to increase segment gross profit by just over $260 million during this two-year period with per ton gross profit increasing more than $1 or over 40%. Certainly a central part of our strategic and operational focus remains on sustaining these trends and fully capitalizing on the continued recovery toward normal levels of demand for the materials we provide.","Now let me turn to Slide 12 to briefly look at our asphalt and concrete segment results for the quarter. These businesses also performed well in the quarter especially given weather related challenges in Texas, Virginia, Arizona and New Mexico. Our local management of these operations continues to service customers well while also effectively managing material margins. And segment results for both asphalt and concrete have benefited from recent transactions that better focus our asset portfolio. Year-to-date the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plans despite weather related challenges. Looking at the asphalt segment, you see the gross profit for the quarter was approximately $21 million, a year-over-year improvement of $12 million driven by strong cost disciplines and margin management as well as the impact of acquired operations.","On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 8% from the prior-year, and unit profitability increased sharply. In looking at the concrete segment, you see second quarter gross profit was approximately $5 million compared to $3 million in the prior year as margin improvements helped offset the impact of work deferred due to weather including a record wet June in the Virginia, Maryland area where we have our largest concrete operation.","Moving now to capital allocation, Slide 13 highlights certain second-quarter actions and updates consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities and capital structure goals. These priorities and goals have not changed, and we continue to work diligently against them. First, we continue to make the CapEx investments necessary to sustain the long-term value of our franchise and to meet our customers rising requirements. Our core CapEx spending for the year remains in line with prior communications at approximately $250 million.","In addition, we've committed to replace two of our three Panamax-class ships which transport product from our high-volume quarry in Mexico. The vessels being replaced have over 30 years of service each, and the advantages of our Bluewater distribution network easily merit the investment. We expect progress payments on the construction of the new ships to be approximately $36 million this year with another $85 million spread across 2016 and 2017.","Next, we intend to maintain our financial strength and flexibility at all parts of the cycle. Consistent with this goal we've now completed the major components of the refinancing plan outlined during our February investor day and discussed at length during our first quarter call. These accomplishments include extending maturities on approximately $620 million of debt otherwise due over the next five years, establishing a new $750 million unsecured credit facility, and lowering our average weighted -- or lowering our weighted average interest rate.","Our second quarter results include $45 million or $0.24 per diluted share of expense associated with this activity. In addition, we took steps in the second quarter to streamline our corporate legal entity structure. These actions improve our flexibility and reduce certain should of burdens, for example, significantly reducing the number of state income tax filings we prepare. We expect another outcome to be a more appropriate and efficient allocation of interest expense and overall taxable income across the states in which we operate. We currently anticipate a $3 million to $5 reduction in the annual state tax expense or an approximately 100 basis point reduction in our overall effective tax rate for 2015. In addition, we may be able to utilize over time all or a portion of approximately $60 million in state level NOLs which may otherwise have expired unused.","Next, we continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions. During the second quarter for example we acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready mix operations in Arizona and New Mexico for approximately $21 million complementing our existing positions in those markets. The pipeline of bolt on acquisition opportunities remains active. But we will remain a disciplined buyer, and as such the number, size and timing of future transactions remains difficult to predict. As our performance improves, so does our capacity to return capital to shareholders. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to both reinvest for growth and return capital to shareholders as the recovery toward normal demand unfolds.","Now let me take a couple -- now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and then our outlook for the balance of 2015 before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks and Q&A.","As Tom noted earlier, and as you can see reflected in our Q2 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. Looking through the weather and the noise in Congress, we and our customers continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. Shipping rates on clear days underscore our recovery demand across geographies and across end uses. With few exceptions, construction activity in our markets remains well below long-term through cycle trends, but the recovery continues. That would be the main message here.","Now to touch briefly on some of the underlying trends in private and public construction. With respect to private demand we continue to see manufacturing and other industrial related projects contributing to significant nonresidential construction growth. And as you probably know, housing starts despite month-to-month volatility continue to trend upward across most Vulcan served markets. On the public side, large projects have driven recent strength in Highway awards. State and local level funding initiatives support continued growth in road and other infrastructure spending particularly in the intermediate term. At the federal level, we remain optimistic that a multiyear bill may pass sometime in the fall. Tom will have more to say on this in a moment, but the need for a meaningful multi-year program is understood on both sides of the aisle, and recent developments have been well covered in the press.","So to the extent we harbor modest concerns regarding our full-year 2015 volumes relative to plan, they primarily relate back to first half weather and the capacity of our customers to complete deferred work during the remainder of the available construction season. In several of our markets, key customers find themselves six or more weeks behind on scheduled work, and they face short-term challenges in adding the capacity required to catch up. In addition, the extension into the fall of uncertainty regarding the federal Highway program may impact the start date and timing of shipments to certain road infrastructure projects. Again, the marginal risk we see to 2015 shipment is one of timing and potential deferral into 2016.","Now I'll turn briefly to Slide 15 and our outlook for the balance of the year. As noted in our earnings release, our full-year EBITDA guidance range remains unchanged at $775 million to $825 million, this despite the weather related challenges of the first half of the year. In short, we anticipate better than expected pricing and margin momentum to offset a potential shortfall in 2015 shipments relative to plan. The continued improvement in pricing and unit margins matches our strategic focus and bodes very well for the longer-term performance and value of our franchise.","I'll now touch on certain of the modest adjustments we've made to assumptions underlying our full-year EBITDA guidance. As stated previously, please view these figures as indicative midpoints of our range of expectations. We want to give you a good feel for how we see the business performing, though we don't want to convey a false sense of precision regarding each and every metric.","With respect to aggregates shipments, we've reduced our midpoint expectations for the year from 180 million tons to 177 million tons. This change reflects the challenges many of our customers face as they try to catch up with deferred work, the longer than expected ramp ups in production at certain of our acquired operations, and marginally higher uncertainty regarding start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects. Our fundamental view of the continued gradual recovery and demand remains unchanged. With regard to aggregates pricing, we've raised our midpoint expectation for year-on-year growth from 6% to 7%. As Tom noted, pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. We expect the rate of improvement in the second half to exceed that of the first half. At this point, we would expect these pricing trends to continue into 2016.","Due to the potential shortfall in 2015 shipment volumes, we have slightly reduced our midpoint expectation for aggregate segment gross profit. We expect the rate at which incremental freight adjusted revenues flow through to incremental gross profit to remain roughly in line with recent trailing 12 month trends. Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisition, divesture and swap activity. As a result we raised our midpoint expectation for full-year gross profit from these segments from $70 million to $80 million. Our expectations for SAG, DD&A and CapEx remain largely unchanged.","All in all, our businesses enjoy strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control.","The underlying fundamentals of our business remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Hill","Thanks, John. As John stated it we are confident in our full-year outlook. We are pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of extreme weather. Our markets continue to improve in each market segment and across most of our geographic footprint. This growing demand is causing pricing momentum to pick up robustly which is clearly demonstrated in the second quarter results. I am confident in our employees' ability to execute on the disciplines of operating efficiencies that drive cost control and customer service that drives value and price all of which improve our unit profitability. We are very proud of our employees' hard work and dedication.","We are also pleased with the level of activity on the Highway bill in Congress over the last two weeks. This culminated on July 30 in the Senate's passage of a new six-year bill the Drive Act. The Senate and house also last week passed a three-month extension to Map 21, the current bill. This will allow the house time to complete work on its version of the new bill.","House and Senate leadership has stated their intention to go to conference with their respective bills and send a new, multi-year built to the President for his signature in the fall. This gathering momentum in Congress to address federal highway investments coupled with growing initiatives to improve roads in many states is very encouraging. We along with many other transportation stakeholders will continue to press for additional much-needed investments in America's aging infrastructure. As we look forward to the balance of 2015, and into 2016 we are excited about the accelerating momentum and demand in pricing and the improving execution by our employees. They are finding new ways to improve this Company and our profitability every day.","Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens.","Trey Grooms","Good morning, guys.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Trey.","Trey Grooms","Tom, you mentioned accelerating demand. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around what you are seeing in specific geographic markets now that the weather has started to cooperate. If you could kind of give us an idea more specifically there.","Tom Hill","Overall we are seeing growth in all market segments as I stated and in the vast majority of our geography. About half of our individual markets we think will experience double digit growth this year. So all across the board we are seeing strong demand. Texas is probably the hottest market we have even with the impact of weather we saw same-store shipments volume up 8% in Texas. Florida continues to be extremely healthy. I think we were up some 11% in Florida for the quarter; Georgia very, very healthy. And actually Georgia got hit a little bit with weather, but there's -- that demand is just pushed back, and every time the sun comes out in Georgia, where shipping very strongly. So overall everything is -- the vast majority of the market is going well. If there is a spot that was a little behind the rest of the country I would say it was Alabama, Mississippi, that area. As I stated, California while the second quarter was a little slow because we had some jobs pushed back, and it may be a little bit behind the rest of the country, overall its demand growth is steady.","Trey Grooms","Okay, great. Thanks for that color. You guys have been putting up some really good incrementals, great unit margins continuing to improve. Just wondering at what point -- I know John mentioned again, touched on the mid-cycle demand expectation of 250 million tons or so. At what point in this recovery coming off of 170 LTM tons do we start to see these incrementals start to slow down some or subside a little bit and maybe the unit margins start to slow with the growth there or improvement?","John McPherson","I think as we talk about these same operations in the peak would've done 300 million tons, we're sitting at as we said 177 million so -- and we said norm was 255 million, so we've got a long ways to go before we start looking at any reduction in incremental revenue -- in incremental returns.","Tom Hill","Trey, all I would add is that while in a few areas we are seeing some rising costs -- some trends in rising costs we are able to manage those so far. You see that in our margin performance. Our operator to local teams did a fantastic job. We don't see any immediate or near-term change in the recent trajectory but I would reiterate that our more long-term, through the cycle commentary and guidance on flow-throughs, is more on the order of 60% than the recent trends you've seen. But that said, don't take that as a signal that we expect some eminent decline in recent performance.","Trey Grooms","Understood. And then on asphalt, very strong, the incrementals and the margins there tracking well above our expectations. Is there anything going on in the quarter there? Do you expect these trends to continue in asphalt?","John McPherson","As the asphalt segment was up some $12 million, $9 million of that was on -- without the same-store basis. $3 million was the acquisition. So we are pleased -- you've got to remember a lot of that asphalt is in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona so they did have the headwinds of weather, so we're very pleased with our operating group being able to deliver value to our customers, manage material margins and operating costs and give customer service with all of that rain. That's tough to do. On top of that, the $3 million that improvement due from the recent acquisitions, we believe that that's a sign those have been integrated well and quickly. In those -- in that, we've got a lot of talent, that we are glad to add to the team. Both the same-store and the acquisitions we're pleased with performance. I don't see anything in this that would slow that down at this point.","Trey Grooms","Thanks a lot for the color. Good luck.","John McPherson","Trey and for others, just to remind people folks newer to our business, we tend to earn pretty good returns on capital in the asphalt segment through the cycle and over time, so we are pleased with those investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. First, is a clarification from acquisition contribution in the quarter both on a top line and a EBIT or operating margin -- operating earnings contribution. You may have had this but I may have missed it. How many tons of aggregates were acquired?","Tom Hill","I think that the tonnage in Q2 from acquisitions was a little north of $1 million. If you look at the overall performance of our acquisitions, we are pleased with it. We had slightly higher costs that was due to two things. Remember a lot of those were in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, again, the weather issue which both dampened shipments and hurt us on cost. We also recognized in a couple of those operations that with some capital and some modifications, we could greatly improve our long-term product offering, quality of our products, and operating efficiencies. So you had those modifications in the first half of the year. I think those are starting to come -- we'll see the fruits of those probably in a quarter or two. But overall, I think we're pleased with it. We are on track to hit the plan that we had for EBITDA of $40 million to $50 million, and I think my folks have done a good job with the integration.","John McPherson","Kathryn, just as a reminder for everyone, we acquired not only some aggregates operations but also some good asphalt and concrete operations. So in total for the quarter the revenue from those operations was approximately $50 million. As they get ramped up and as we put some additional costs into them as we ramp them up and I'd say ramp them up and as Tom mentioned hit some particular product needs of particular customer groups, the EBITDA contribution in the quarter was about $11 million year-to-date. About $16 million from those acquisitions and generally on track as Tom said with our expectations.","Tom Hill","Let me correct one thing. That volume was just north of $1.4 million, I misspoke, in aggregates.","Kathryn Thompson","Helpful color on that. In terms of aggregate pricing. We always understand since it's a local market, and it's -- also pricing can be vary widely according to geography and then also to mix. With that in mind, do you -- two-part question. One, with pricing accelerating as the year progresses, how much of this is a function of higher magnitude price increases versus a greater mix of higher priced markets finally gaining pricing? Thank you.","Tom Hill","I think in all pricing was up in all markets except for Virginia. And that was really a mix issue. We had some very large sales of base and fines which as we say is a good thing. We like that. It actually improves our profitability. We are seeing robust price increases in most of our markets. I'll give you a little flavor on that. If you looked at South Carolina, Arizona, Alabama, we saw price increases from $0.40 to $0.50 in the second quarter. In the middle of the country which would be Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Illinois, we saw price increases in the $0.60 to $0.75 per ton range. And then we saw in a few markets we saw some very marked price jumps in the $0.80 to $1.20 a ton range in California, Florida, Georgia and Texas. But overall our -- it's still a local business, and our local teams are working hard to make sure we deliver value and quality and service to our customers. I think we have a lot of confidence that the pricing momentum is across all markets, and we feel good about it at this point.","John McPherson","Kathryn, I think those are the most important points. We haven't had much tailwind to pricing at based on geographic mix if that was your question. It's more prices across many, many markets improving.","Kathryn Thompson","That was just to the point I was going to follow up on. Given you haven't seen a tailwind from geographic mix and you are also flowing through costs from acquired assets, you should see theoretically, all things equal, improving incremental margins as the year progresses.","Tom Hill","All things being equal.","Kathryn Thompson","Absolutely understood.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Ted Grace","I was hoping to follow up on Trey's question first on the demand side. Mother Nature wiling, we've got three to four months left on the construction season. To the degree you are comfortable framing out how you're thinking about the out year, it would be great just to get a sense for what the leading edge indicators are that you're looking at, how quoting activity seems this early looking out into 2016 kind of maybe quarterly business review highlights. Anything you can point to on that front that would be helpful handholding.","John McPherson","Ted, this is John. Why don't I give a couple of numbers just to lay out a couple benchmarks maybe and Tom will add some additional market color in terms of what we're seeing from customers. All in all, we estimate that we've had about 4 million tons of aggregate shipments to start there deferred out of the first half. You can tell that we expect to catch up maybe about 1 million of those in the balance of the year, just by the change in our indicative guidance. A lot of that will, as you said, depend on Mother Nature and how long the remainder of the construction season is. And it really depends a good bit on how well many of our customers, and Tom can comment more, how much capacity they can add, and how much work they can just get done. To give you a rough sense of the 4 million tons we have seen deferred on the first-half roughly we'd expect to catch up about 1 million tons of that in the second half. That is less a function of any demands concern and just more a function of the time and capacity of our customers to get their work completed.","Tom Hill","I think well said. Ted, as you said we probably have four months of solid season left. It will come down to constraints from contractors. Can they get in to get the job? How many ready mix trucks can they get? How fast can they get crews laying asphalt? But overall, remember this is work that we see if we don't get it in the third quarter, fourth-quarter this year it will follow in the first or second quarter of next year. So it won't go away. It's just postponed. And it's very normal when we have this kind of weather to see it push back, and when the sun comes out we are shipping hard.","Ted Grace","Okay. So, maybe asked a little bit differently, if we were to think about the comments on a gradual recovery, normal recovery, would it be fair to think, at least the way you're thinking internally, is growth rates of end markets in 2016 could approximate 2015? Anything you might share on that end?","John McPherson","Ted, we haven't giving any guidance, obviously, and we will do that at the right time but there's nothing -- overall across what is a fairly diversified geographic portfolio for us, we don't see anything at this point that would indicate a slowing momentum heading into next year.","Ted Grace","Okay. That's really helpful.","John McPherson","There are always state specific issues, right? But across the portfolio in total, although we're not giving guidance, we don't see any decline in momentum.","Ted Grace","That's helpful. The second point of clarification, could you give us a bridge on EBITDA 2Q 2014 to 2Q 2015 -- I know there pricing is a tailwind, volumes are tailwind, energy is a tailwind, acquisitions are tailwinds. Can you just maybe help bridge it so we can understand the headwinds more granularly. I know R&M, labor was up, SG&A, a bridge there would be great, and I'll get back in queue.","Tom Hill","Really I think the only headwind that we saw was probably (inaudible) was costs in the quarter was slightly higher. Labor costs, and I mentioned R&M were up. The labor piece, weather causes inefficiencies in the stone operation, actually ready mix and asphalt also, but -- so weather affected labor. It also affected the rest of our operating efficiencies and tons per gallon of fuel and electrical power. We are also beginning to run our plant with increased demand. We're starting to run our plants a little harder and longer. When you start to do this to start finding a few weak spots in the fixed equipment.","We also took the opportunity in the second quarter when we were down to do repairs so R&M costs was up. But if you look at it from a longer-term view, our year-to-date cost is down about $0.10. On a same-store basis it's down $0.16, trailing 12 month is down $0.22. But the disciplines in operating efficiencies and operating costs is something that everybody focuses on every day. It is something you just got to stay on top of, or it will get away. I think our people are very focused on the things they control and the efficiencies in those operations. The headwind that I saw in the quarter was really one of cost and it was a mix of R&M and weather-related inefficiencies.","John McPherson","Ted, if it helps at the gross profit line we basically as Tom was describing had a wash between some diesel benefits we had and other cost increases. So on a per unit basis that was cost structure basically a wash at the gross profit line so really the biggest bridge, if you will, of course, gets back to volume. And again if we had 4 million tons deferred out of the first half of aggregates we would estimate that's about a $35 million impact or so plus or minus at the EBITDA line. But the biggest factor in the quarter -- the costs were ultimately a wash, managed well. Volume of course is a headwind. If that's helpful.","Ted Grace","I can get more into that offline. Thanks and best of luck this quarter, guys.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Armstrong from Vertical Research Partners.","James Armstrong","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter. My first question, a follow-up on the asphalt segment. How much of the incremental operating margin was impacted due to oil prices, and if oil was a significant part of that, do you believe that you'll have to pass on some of that as the year progresses, or will you be able to maintain those margin levels for the remainder of the year?","Tom Hill","There were definitely tailwinds with oil, but I think you have to look at it to separate that out when you're running over 50 asphalt plants and across the whole Southwest is really difficult to do. It's really a matter of managing the usage of oil with recycled asphalt products, recycled shingles each mix design maximizing it out and then maximizing operating efficiencies and the costs just to run the operation along with sales and service and value and price. So I think to try to separate that out is pretty tough to do. As far as giving that back, giving back any savings on oil, we don't see -- we don't see that -- those headwinds at this point. You don't know that for sure, but I think that right now we're pretty confident in our ability to manage the combination of customer service material margin operating costs and continue what we're doing today.","James Armstrong","Thank you. And then on the aggregate segment as we go into the back half of the year, have the regions in which you are seeing pricing momentum changed from what you saw in the first half of the year, and can you detail that a little bit more for us?","Tom Hill","I don't know that anything has changed as far as the momentum we see in the pricing. Obviously, the margins that are more mature in the recovery margins because price lags volume are seeing the bigger jump in pricing. But overall I think the trend is pretty steady. I think it will continue. Not only is it steady, but it will continue to improve as we go forward and as we said earlier, we'll be back half loaded with a price improvement.","John McPherson","The range varies substantially across markets but I think to come back to what Tom said, I think all of our states saw pricing increase in the same-store basis at some level. So a trend if we went back a few quarters would be that it's broadening. The rates vary substantially across states, but the trend would be that it's been broadening.","James Armstrong","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","PT Luther","Hi, John, it's actually PT Luther in for Timna today. You made some pretty universally positive comments in terms of demand trends. I just wanted to check and see if you are seeing much leakage just from the weaker energy markets in any of your -- among any of your customers maybe in LNG projects things like that.","Tom Hill","If you look at the energy projects along the coast, the LNG projects, the refinery projects we are actually seeing that continue to pick up. My guess is we'll ship over 2 million tons to that segment on the coast. Remember, the reason why we are so advantaged with our blue water delivery to those projects require big volumes by water in a short amount of time. So if you put that over 2 million to 2.5 million tons this year I would tell you that next year for what we know right now we will -- and this is what we have probably under contract we'd be just south of 2 million tons. Is probably on the drawing board another 8 million tons in projects that are out there that haven't bid, they are still in the permitting or planning process. So no slowdown in the energy projects along the coast.","PT Luther","Great. Thanks. In terms of the pricing momentum you're talking about in the second half, is that primarily from price hikes that you've already implemented and announced in the first half? Or does some of that assume some additional price hikes in the second half as well?","Tom Hill","As we always say, our pricing is across dozens of markets, so each one is individual. Then you've got, within those markets, you have fixed plants where you have got price increases that come at all different times of the year. And then you've got quoted work which you are pressing price with each quote, each week. So, it is a combination of what we've secured, pricing that will quote higher in the second half and then announced price increases in the second half. And then you are also working off of old work, so you've got to put all that into the mix and again you've got to aggregate all those pricing movements across all those markets.","PT Luther","Great, that's helpful. Thanks again.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research","Garik Shmois","Hi, thank you and congratulations. First question is on diesel had a nice benefit here in the second quarter. Coming into the beginning of the year we thought there could be potential upside because of diesel savings. Just wondering how you're thinking about diesel costs in the back half of the year as it relates to your overall EBITDA guidance.","Tom Hill","I think if you look at our guidance, this goes into individual operations, and so there is diesel savings built in from a ground-up perspective in the second half of the year. There's also built into that is labor costs and repair and maintenance costs and operating supply and parts. So I think when you put all that together if you look at our guidance we do have diesel built into it.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. I guess it's fair to assume that some of the other costs you've mentioned will partially offset.","John McPherson","I think that's the right way to think about it, Garik, I don't know that we're the world's best to predicting future diesel prices and those kinds of things, but we will begin to comp over, if you will, lower costs as we get into the third and fourth quarter. So I think you summed it up well which is, we would expect to continue to manage to improving margins in the second half in total, and underneath that is a mix of several factors probably a little help from diesel costs, probably a little bit higher repair and maintenance costs than we have seen in the past.","Garik Shmois","Makes sense. Shifting to capital allocation, you mentioned think it was $30 million or so to update your Panamax fleet. Just wondering if this is in relation to any sort of capacity addition that you are undergoing in the Cancun facility and if we should anticipate increased volumes coming out for your long-haul operations?","Tom Hill","These are specific replacements for the ships that we started that operation with. So those ships are some 30 years old. It's time for them to retire for all kinds of reasons. Now what we will get in the new ships is, with technology, we'll have a little more payload. We'll have much better fuel efficiency's and probably a little better speed out of the ships, so we'll get better efficiencies, but the bottom line of that is those ships are replacements.","Garik Shmois","Okay. I'll ask the highway bill question. You sounded pretty optimistic in your prepared remarks around a new highway bill. Just wondering, it's early, but if you could provide some thoughts on if we do get a multi-year bill towards the end of the year potentially what kind of volume opportunity would that imply for aggregates demands moving forward?","Tom Hill","I don't know that we put a number to that, because we've got so many unknowns in that highway bill and what does it mean. We have not at this point. The one thing I will say is that a long-term bill, even at the funding we have today, is a good thing for us. Because it gives security to those states so that -- we've got a number of states that are pushing back big jobs because they don't have security that they're going to get paid by the federal government. So worst-case if we get flat funding with a long-term bill we look at it as a very good thing. At the same time, we've got a number of states which have already substantially increased their funding, and we have a number of very key states to us including California which are looking at ways -- recognize that they have to increase their funding and are taking steps towards that. So overall, with the steps that the Senate is taking and that the house is taking we're pleased with it. We've got high hopes for it. We think we've got a lot of momentum. And on top of that you've got the momentum of improving state funding or the recognition that state funding has to increase.","Garik Shmois","Got it. Thanks again.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Jerry Revich","Just to continue the discussion on the regulatory side. California is in session, or the legislature is in session about potentially increasing state highway funding. How optimistic are you that something goes through and what's your sense on where that process stands now? [Multiple Speakers]","Tom Hill","Let me give you a little background on California. Their highway bill right now is at about $11 billion annually. If things stay status quo, they've cut that to about 5% to about $10.5 billion. They recognize that they have to take steps to not only keep that whole but to improve it. There's Senate Bill 16 which is out there right now which would increase it by another $3 billion. It is too early to give you a guess on that at this point or a prediction. I think the good thing is that they recognize that they have a shortfall. They're going to have to address it, and they are taking steps for it. Of there's any place that needs roads, California sure does. They do recognize it, and the leadership there is taking steps to improve it.","Jerry Revich","What's your sense on timing? How do you expect it to play out what are the negative -- ","Tom Hill","Too early to tell. I think it's too early to tell. I wouldn't take a guess at it at this point.","Jerry Revich","In the press release you highlighted stripping costs just naturally in mine plans evolve as companies get price increases. Can you just counsel us on how to think about stripping costs over the next couple of years? How much are you changing mine plans as pricing is picking up here?","Tom Hill","I don't know that were changing mine plans with pricing. That wouldn't drive a mine plan. It's really based on the long-term operations of a quarry. Obviously as volume goes up you just have to strip more because you have your producing more tons. I think other times, as we are opportunistic when we strip, so it may be that when we are not running operations for whatever reason we take the crew and equipment and go strip because is it's just good sense and good use of costs. But overall, I don't see -- price doesn't have an impact, volume obviously does, because you just have to strip more with more volume. And in each individual mine, it's based on what that operation has to do for the long-term. We're running these operations for decades, not a few years, so -- and stripping is the big part of the long-term planning.","Jerry Revich","Alright, thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam Thalhimer","[Indiscernible] Thanks.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Adam Thalhimer","John, I think you said for this year -- you did say for this year up 7% price you were previously saying up 6%. I thought I heard you say that that level of pricing growth is a good number for 2016 as well. Is that right?","John McPherson","I think what we said -- I wouldn't put down a specific level, but we currently see this kind of pricing momentum continuing into 2016. It's not just -- this is a more structural trend in our business. It's not a one or two or three quarter trend. But not trying to give you guidance for any specific number for 2016.","Tom Hill","Let me add a little bit to that. I think it's more about momentum. And you are seeing -- we told you that price was going to follow volume. And that as volume continued to grow, pricing would grow behind it. And that was very apparent in the second quarter. I think as we continue to see volume grow, you will continue to see pricing momentum grow. Not just the percentage, but overall pricing will continue to accelerate.","Adam Thalhimer","You gave a good breakdown of volume by month in Q2. I'm just curious whether you can share figures for July.","John McPherson","No, we're not -- we can't give guidance at this point on that.","Adam Thalhimer","Worth a shot. And just in general it feels like volume -- it feels like you've been a little conservative with the volume expeditions in the back half. I guess you're assuming that 3 million tons are either lost because of the weather or maybe push to 2016?","Tom Hill","I think for sure they are not lost. Those jobs are not going away. Our customers have a backlog and are going to do the work. It's really a matter of if you look at hundreds of jobs and even the fixed plant with hundreds of jobs, can they get on that job? Can they get it all done in the compressed amount of time they have to do it in the construction season 2015? So if they don't get it done, it will push back into first quarter, second quarter of 2016. If you look at asphalt for example, asphalt and our ready mix plant is do they have the plant capacity and the truck capacity to catch up from where they are? Again, it's not lost. If it doesn't happen in 2015, it will happen in 2016. As I said earlier, this is really normal for when we have severe weather like this. We'll do the work. It's just a matter of timing.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll now hand the call back over to Tom Hill, President and CEO, for your closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Thank all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We are proud of our second quarter, and we look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. We'll talk to you then. Thank you.","Operator","This is the end of today's call.

My name is Erica and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.","Donald M. James","Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2012. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President for Construction Materials; and John McPherson, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business Development.","We have posted to our website a short slide presentation that we will be referring to during the call. The slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Description of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS for continuing operations. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website at vulcanmaterials.com.","I would now like to walk you through our first quarter results. As you saw in the press release we issued this morning, we began 2012 with another strongly improved quarter. Our results were substantially better compared to the first quarter of last year. ","Net sales were approximately $500 million. This is a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2011. Although some of this year-over-year growth is attributable to milder weather, we also benefited from the continued recovery of our markets, particularly in the demand for Aggregates, combined with the strength of our market positions.","Gross profit for the first quarter increased $29 million from the first quarter of 2011, reflecting sales growth in every segment and the favorable earnings effect of improved productivity and cost reduction. Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 600 basis points from the same period last year.","When making year-over-year comparisons of earnings and EBITDA, it's important to note a few items that impact these comparisons. One, the first quarter of 2012 included $10 million of cost related to Martin Marietta's unsolicited offer. Two, the first quarter of 2012 also included a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate in California. And three, in the first quarter of last year, the company received approximately $25.5 million in an insurance arbitration award for the recovery of settlement and legal cost related to a lawsuit settled in 2010. Excluding these items, EBITDA increased to $46 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $5 million of EBITDA in the prior year.","Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items I highlighted, were a loss of $0.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a loss of $0.62 per diluted share in the same period last year. ","Further enhancing operating earnings, SAG expenses decreased by $13 million or 17% compared to the prior year period. This decrease was due mainly to cost reduction initiatives undertaken in 2011. In addition, the Profit Enhancement Plan we announced in February is well underway, and will generate significant additional savings and profit enhancements.","John McPherson will update you on that shortly. ","Turning to our segment results on Slide 4, our Aggregate segment performed very well, reflecting continued market recovery and favorable weather. Segment revenues, which include sales to our Asphalt and Concrete businesses, increased approximately $24 million or roughly 7% from the prior year period. And gross profit increased $23 million.","Aggregate revenues reflect stronger demand, including increased demand from our Asphalt and Concrete operations, as well as generally stable pricing. First quarter Aggregate shipments increased 10% from the prior year, and coupled with lower unit cost of sales, led to a sharp increase in Aggregates' gross profit margin. Shipments increased in almost all of our geographic markets. Our operations in California and Virginia continued their trend of achieving much stronger than average volume gains from the prior year.","Our Aggregates businesses in 8 other states also achieved double-digit volume gains over the prior year's first quarter, most notably key states like Florida, Texas and Alabama. These increases were due mainly to large infrastructure project work, primarily highways, some improvement in private construction activity, as well as favorable weather conditions.","Average freight adjusted selling price decreased by 1% in the first quarter due mostly to a less favorable product mix. ","In the first quarter, above-average levels of lower priced products, including base stone and fill material, were shipped to large projects in Virginia. Excluding the fill material shipments, which are sporadic and infrequent relative to other sizes, first quarter pricing was flat with the prior year.","Overall, we continued to see pricing stability across our markets. In the first quarter, more than half of our markets realized price improvement from the prior year, a trend that has continued for the last 4 quarters. ","Importantly, Aggregates gross profit increased to approximately $34 million, reflecting the earnings effect of higher volumes and improved productivity, which contributed to lower unit cost of sales. This increase is more than triple the $11 million in Aggregates gross profit we recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and shows the favorable earnings impact of the operating leverage inherent in our business. This is also a continuation of what we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, net sales have increased $73 million and gross profit has increased $53 million in the trailing 6 months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the prior period last year.","Aggregates gross profit as a percent of segment revenues for the quarter increased by 640 basis points. Cash earnings per ton increased by 11% to $3.36.","Helping to drive our first quarter results in Aggregates, we continued to pursue opportunities in plant operations, including executing a turnaround of specific underperforming facilities, increasing the exchange of operating practices and talent across geographies, and improving central service facility sharing across regions.","Segment unit cost of sales decreased approximately 10% from the prior year due to increased productivity, cost-reduction initiatives and the operating leverage realized from higher volumes. All key labor productivity and energy efficiency metrics for Aggregates improved compared to last year's first quarter, more than offsetting an 11% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel.","For our Asphalt Mix segment, gross profit in the first quarter was a loss of less than $1 million, approximating last year's breakeven earnings. The average sales price for asphalt mix increased approximately 6%, offsetting most of the earnings effect of a 16% increase in liquid asphalt cost. The Asphalt Mix volume increased 3% from last year's first quarter.","In Concrete, gross profit was a loss of $12 million compared to a loss of $14 million in the prior year. Ready-mixed concrete volumes increased 12% from the prior year. The average sales price increased 1% from the prior year, contributing to improved unit materials margin.","Finally, Cement segment gross profit was $1 million, an improvement of $4 million from the prior year due to increased volumes and lower operating costs. ","In total, gross profit for our non-Aggregate segments improved by $6 million, reflecting cost reduction initiatives.","Turning now to Slide 5. We wanted to take a step back and review the significant progress Vulcan has made and continues to make in reducing cost. As you can see in this slide, our full year SAG expense reductions should further accelerate as a result of our cost savings initiatives and by leveraging our ERP and Shared Services platforms. By the end of 2012, Vulcan is on target to have reduced run rate SAG expenses by at least 32% since 2007.","Spending for our new ERP systems peaked in 2010. We are now reaping the benefits, both in improved efficiency and in our ability to undertake the restructuring actions we announced last year, as well as pursuing the Profit Enhancement Plan.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John McPherson who will provide a brief update on our Profit Enhancement Plan. John?","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Don. ","Hey, now turning to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight the steady progress we've been making in the Profit Enhancement Plan that we announced in February. As you may recall, the Profit Enhancement Plan includes cost reductions and other profit enhancements to improve our run rate profitability as measured by EBITDA at current volumes by more than $100 million annually. Of that $100 million in profit enhancements, $25 million is expected to be achieved in 2012, $75 million is expected to be achieved in 2013, with the full run rate in place by mid-2013. And as a result, the full $100 million is expected to be achieved and hit the P&L in 2014.","These enhancements are, and I'd like to underscore this, in addition to the $55 million in run rate overhead reductions achieved through our restructuring actions announced in 2011. ","Of the $100 million in profit enhancements we expect to achieve through this initiative, $55 million should be derived from savings in sourcing, $25 million from G&A and support functions and another $20 million from transportation and logistics.","I'd now like to give a brief update on progress in each of these 3 areas. ","In sourcing, we have renegotiated vendor agreements and pricing for categories ranging from office supplies to mobile equipment. In addition, we have expanded the role of our professional procurement staff. We have strengthened certain procurement policies and programs, and we've taken steps to accelerate company-wide adoption of these programs.","Initial actions have been taken to reduce spending related to outside services, a category that includes costs such as drilling and blasting, electrical, repair and maintenance, and landscaping. This category includes over $150 million in annual spending at the plant level. We will address other categories of procured goods and services over at least the next 2 quarters, and we remain fully committed to reducing the annual run rate spending on third-party goods and services by $55 million or more before mid-2013.","In G&A, additional efficiencies have been identified in accounting, HR, IT, legal and other support functions. These efficiencies leverage our prior restructuring in ERP investments and include actions such as further standardization and simplification of administrative policies and practices, further consolidation of support activities to leverage the company's systems of scale, and further streamlining in automation of management processes and reporting.","We implemented certain of these improvements during the first quarter and we'll implement others throughout the balance of the year. Again, we remain fully committed to reducing overhead costs by $25 million or more without negatively impacting our safety, environmental, customer service or sales performance.","In the area of transportation and logistics, our transition to the 4-region structure has positioned the company to further optimize intermodal transportation decisions to better manage the deployment of rail cars and other assets, and to consistently assess and adopt best trucking practices across operating units.","For each of our trucking, rail and marine operations, we have identified opportunities to reduce cost and increase revenues associated with our owned and contracted transportation assets. We remain on target to increase profits in this area by more than $20 million through our initiatives in -- over the next year.","I'd like to note that across all of these areas, our employees at all levels of the business have demonstrated great ingenuity and commitment in managing costs smartly, while remaining focused on serving our customers and operating safely.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd.","Danny R. Shepherd","Thank you, John. Well, as John noted, we are very pleased with our progress over the last 2 months, and the organization is fully committed and engaged in the Profit Enhancement Program. We remain very optimistic that we will achieve our goals.","Now if you turn to Slide 7, during the quarter, we also continued to execute on our Planned Asset Sales initiative, which was also announced in February. As previously disclosed, we'll be selling operations that are not core to our strategy. These are quality assets, many of which will have significant value to a number of potential purchasers. Thus far, we've been pleased with the level of interest and activity surrounding the process. The divested assets will include ready-mixed Concrete and Cement operations, nonstrategic Aggregates assets and real estate.","This initiative is in line with our strategy to focus our capital on higher return, higher growth Aggregates positions, optimize our exposure to downstream businesses and unlock value of real estate from our portfolio.","We have completed similar transactions in the past in states like Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, Arizona and others. We are focused on optimizing value as a disciplined seller, and we continue to expect this initiative will generate net proceeds of approximately $500 million by mid-2013.","Importantly, these actions will enhance our longer-term earnings growth profile, margins and return on capital employed as demand for our products improves with the economic recovery.","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Don.","Donald M. James","Thanks, Danny. ","If you will turn with me now to Slide 8. Sentiment is spreading that the worst of this economic downturn is behind us. This view appears to be supported by the U.S. contract awards for new construction projects, particularly in private construction, which bodes well for continued demand recovery in our high-growth markets.","Multi-family housing starts have remained strong, growing now for 17 consecutive months. Trailing 12 months single-family housing starts turned positive in the first quarter of 2012 on the back of higher starts reported in recent months.","As of March of 2012, the year-over-year change in trailing 12-month contract awards for private nonresidential construction has remained positive for the last year. This positive trend is driven by growth in contract awards for commercial and retail building. Additionally, trailing 3-month awards for Vulcan-served states are up 10% versus other states, which are down 12%. This is another positive indicator for continued demand recovery in our high growth markets.","Finally, private non-highway infrastructure projects, mainly power-related projects, have been positive, although very lumpy due to the large scale and scope of these projects, which can consume large quantities of Aggregates.","Trailing 12-month contract awards in Vulcan-served states are up 34% compared with other states, which are down 27%.","On the public side, contract award activity has been mixed. Trailing 12-month awards for non-highway infrastructure projects are down 2% versus the prior year. In highways, trailing 12-month awards for the period ending March 2012 were $51.4 billion, down 11% from the prior year, reflecting the absence of $7.5 billion in stimulus-related project awards from last year.","Prospects for the next federal highway bill are improving. At this time, we are operating under a 90-day extension at current funding levels. Last week, the House of Representatives passed by a wide and bipartisan margin, additional legislation designed to expedite a House-Senate conference on a new highway bill. This follows the bipartisan passage of the Senate highway bill earlier in the spring. It is the stated intention of both the House and Senate leadership to resolve their differences on the highway bill and produce a conference agreement before the end of the current extension that avoids additional disruption in the Federal Highway Program.","Just this week, Senate and House leaders have announced the members of the conference committee that will focus on reconciling the Senate bill with the House proposals. It is a streamlined conference committee, notably smaller than was the case with SAFETEA-LU, and it is composed of a number of strong highway program proponents from both parties and from both the House and the Senate. We, along with a broad coalition of stakeholders including unions, highway users, industry and state and local government officials are urging Congress to reach agreement on this new bill as quickly as possible to facilitate a recovery in construction activity.","Turning now to Slide 9. For 2012, we continued to expect earnings in each of our segments to improve from the prior year due to continued growth in volumes, higher pricing and reduced cost. We now expect that total aggregate shipments will increase by approximately 2% to 4% based on our strong performance in the first quarter and solid demand levels. We have adjusted our full year freight-adjusted pricing for Aggregates to reflect the impact of the product mix shift in the first quarter. As a result, we now expect aggregate pricing to increase by 1% to 3% for the full year.","In addition, Aggregates segment unit cost should be lower than in 2011 due to improved productivity, restructuring of overhead support functions and the implementation of the Profit Enhancement Plan. As a result, Aggregate segment earnings are expected to improve substantially from 2011. ","Asphalt earnings are expected to increase due to higher pricing and modest growth in volumes. Ready-mixed Concrete pricing should continue to improve and shipments should increase modestly from the prior year, contributing to an improvement in earnings.","Cement earnings should approach the breakeven levels in 2012. And energy-related costs, specifically unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt, are now expected to increase 5% to 10% from full year 2011 levels.","As we noted earlier, we continue to expect full year 2012 SAG cost to be approximately $270 million. We also continue to expect 2012 EBITDA of about $500 million, including $25 million related to the Profit Enhancement Plan and approximately $29 million in gains for 2 real estate transactions that were initiated in 2011 prior to the announcement of the Planned Asset Sales that are not part of that program.","Our full year EBITDA guidance excludes impacts from Planned Asset Sales and costs associated with the unsolicited offer.","We continue to expect capital spending in 2012 to be approximately $100 million.","In summary, we had a much better first quarter and our outlook for the year remains favorable.","Moving to Slide 10, I should note that in addition to delivering strong improvements in our financial results for the last 2 quarters, we also recorded the best safety and health performance in the history of our company in 2011. ","And our environmental performance resulted in the lowest number of environmental citation since 1999, when we were a very much smaller company. We take pride in our safety record, which is among the best in the industry, but we are always looking to improve. Our performance last year is a testament to the focus and professionalism of our employees and their commitment to maintaining a safe work environment.","Finally, before taking your questions, I wanted to take a moment to briefly comment on Martin Marietta's offer. Vulcan has been and continues to be open to transactions that create value for our shareholders. The long history of discussions between Vulcan and Martin Marietta demonstrates our willingness to explore potential value-adding strategies. However, we will not agree to a transaction that dilutes Vulcan's shareholder value. And put simply, we do not believe that Martin Marietta's offer reflects the intrinsic value of Vulcan's assets or would create value for our shareholders. It doesn't compensate our shareholders for Vulcan's strong operating leverage, which we believe should continue to drive strong performance as our markets recover. The benefits of this leverage are clear in the results we announced today. Nor does Martin's offer compensate Vulcan shareholders for the benefits of our Profit Enhancement Plan, which is delivering real, tangible results for Vulcan shareholders. In addition, the offer would enable Martin Marietta shareholders to capture a significant portion of the value that our ongoing initiatives are creating. We believe this is value that belongs to Vulcan shareholders.","Finally, the significant divestitures that may be required by the Department of Justice to complete a transaction will erode value that belongs to Vulcan shareholders and add great uncertainty to the Martin Marietta offer. ","Accordingly, we continue to recommend that shareholders not tender any shares to Martin Marietta. We remain focused on shareholder value. We are executing our initiatives to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead costs, strengthen our credit profile and restore a meaningful dividend as rapidly as possible. ","And if Vulcan decides to pursue a value-enhancing transaction, whether with Martin Marietta, one of its competitors or none of the above, it is Vulcan's board, which has undivided loyalty to Vulcan and its shareholders, and not Martin Marietta's hand-picked nominees that should be negotiating on Vulcan's behalf.","I know many of you have an interest in Martin Marietta's offer. But we hope that you will focus today on our results, on our outlook for 2012, and on the initiatives we have in place to further enhance our performance and shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Don, I apologize if I missed it, but I wanted to come back and revisit the highway contract awards. We tracked the data and I guess we've noticed a pretty sharp decline, certainly January, February, improvement on a relative basis in March. But I guess the way we tracked it across your 10 states, I have it down 12% on a trailing 12-month average basis. It's your forward contracts on highways, just federal highways. But I'm wondering if -- are we missing something? Or is there anything that's gone on that might explain the really sharp decline of January, February this year?","Donald M. James","Ted, I think if you look at the year-over-year change in highway contract awards from the stimulus funding, that accounts for virtually all or maybe more than all of the difference year-over-year. Those stimulus projects are still largely under construction, but the contract awards coming from stimulus money have virtually come to a halt. Because that -- the contract award part had deadlines, but as you know, there are still many, many stimulus projects under construction.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure. Do you think there was any impact from the uncertainty on the highway bill and now that we've got the CR signed?","Donald M. James","Absolutely. I think the DOTs are not willing to award new contracts till they see some more certainty in the Federal Highway Program. We work very closely with the Association of State Highway Transportation Officials and they are, as I indicated, lobbying as hard as we are to convince their congressmen and senators from all of their states that we need to quit quibbling and get something in place that will allow the state DOTs to move forward with the backlog of projects.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And so as you guys kind of look at April and the trends you've noticed that you might be willing to talk about through this month, is it your sense that contract awards are starting to improve on that basis? And then I was wondering if you could also just talk about pricing that you've seen, March versus April.","Donald M. James","I haven't seen any April contract award data yet, so I really can't comment on that. Pricing, our guidance for pricing for the full year is up 1% to 3%. That's down a notch from our guidance beginning earlier in the year. And that's really because of 2 or 3 big large projects where we sold some, essentially, by-product or fill product at relatively low prices to some large construction projects, particularly in Virginia. So it's really on that basis that we ratcheted down our pricing assumption for the full year. But as I said, there is stability in pricing in the sense that we don't have wide swings from -- and price changes from market to market. And we're optimistic that we'll be able to report price improvement as the year moves forward.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. The last thing I was hoping to ask you or Danny is on the asset sales. And I know Danny reaffirmed confidence and the slide deck said that you can get $500 million announced by the middle of 2013. Just given the progress you've had to date on that process, should we look for this to come in chunkier transactions? Will there be more kind of one-off transactions? And any more color you might provide on the process would be super.","Danny R. Shepherd","I think the way I would answer your question, Ted, is some of it would be one-off transactions, but we do have a combination of ready-mixed assets or assets that could be sold in a single transaction. I will add that we are encouraged or we're early in the process, but the interest that we're receiving from interested parties has been very, very encouraging, and hopefully, we'll have something positive to report in the near future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I had a handful of questions, but let's stick on that question about mix there for a second and the big projects in Virginia and other places. I mean, is this the kind of thing that you expect to persist for a little while? This sort of newly -- I think, you described that the volumes of those products is above average.","Donald M. James","I think this is -- the contract awards indicate that private sector construction is well on its way to recovery, office buildings and other large private construction. These sales in Virginia were to large, private construction projects, manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities. But the kind of material we sold in the first quarter is really sort of a one-off. That's not a routine part of our business. We'll, in the course of production, put finds aside and then a big project will come along and take several hundred thousand tons for one project. And that's what happened in the first quarter. I don't see that being a continuing trend, if I'm understanding your question.","L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, that was the question. And this -- and thanks to that. I did have one -- I was going to follow up and ask if that was a private job or a highway job, so it's interesting that it was on the private side. To the extent you can tell, and I'm sure it's probably hard given the lumpiness of the transactions, but can you tell what the price trend on that sort of lower-priced material is? I mean, is it pretty aggressively bid right now or is the price for that product sort of firm enough?","Donald M. James","Well, it's just a very low-priced product. I mean, it's a fraction of our average selling price. That's why I pulled the reported freight-adjusted selling price down to minus 1%. Absent that, we were flat. We certainly believe we'll have opportunities through the year in our normal product mix, normal geographic mix, that we'll see pricing improvement as the year moves on.","L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. On that point, last year, around midyear, I guess, there were price increases in Aggregates put through in a lot of places, driven by the increase in diesel cost. Obviously, diesel\u2019s back up again this year. I mean is there any outlook to kind of go for a second round, if we can think about it that way, this summer?","Donald M. James","Well, certainly, higher diesel costs support higher Aggregate pricing for at least 2 reasons. One is it increases production costs in the plants, and secondly, it increases delivery cost, which shrinks the shipping radius, and therefore, gives an individual quarry typically more pricing power. The -- our full year -- the big increase in diesel cost occurred second half of last year. And as I -- as we indicated, we think diesel cost increases for full year 2012 will be in the 5% to 10% range, which will be substantially lower increase than we saw last year. But nevertheless, they're still up. Most of our cost elements are down. Our labor productivity is better. Our energy, our electricity consumption and energy conversion is better. So we're doing -- our guys in the plants are doing a super job on cost management and cost control. The one place we have higher cost is in diesel fuel. I believe it was up 11% in the quarter over last year's first quarter. But we're offsetting that with other productivities. So if we get some moderation in diesel fuel cost, it will certainly help us as the year moves forward.","L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. On the activity in D.C. with the conference committee around the highway bill, can you kind of walk us through what you're hearing? I mean obviously, there's -- in terms of the annual funding level, I guess the House and the Senate have been pretty close to one another barring recent...","Donald M. James","Which is stable, stable to up slightly.","L.  Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. But there's been a spread there on -- in terms of the duration and in terms of how to pay for it. Do you have any -- is there any conversation as to how they might bridge the gaps there?","Donald M. James","Well, as you know, the Senate, the Senate EPW Committee reported its bill out 18 to 0, all Democrats, all Republicans fully aligned. It had offsets from other spending cuts of $12 billion plus or minus, which funded, in addition to the regular Highway Trust Fund and the receipts in the Highway Trust Fund, it fully funded the Senate bill through the end of FY '13. The House bill, really wasn't a bill. It was something that was passed by leadership in order to get to a conference committee. There is no funding mechanism per se in the House side. The -- I think as we read the tea leaves, you have a lot of Democrats, in both the House and the Senate, willing to support the Senate bill. You've got Senate Republicans, by and large, supporting the Senate bill, and you have a substantial portion of House Republicans, including all the leadership who, I think, will coalesce around the Senate bill. The problem, of course, are the same group that's opposed to a lot of other things in the House. But our view is that the leadership in both House and the Senate is committed to getting this thing passed so it is not an issue in the election. And in order to do that, they need to do it by June 30. And they seem to be fully committed to doing that. You've got the Keystone Pipeline in the House bill that's not in the Senate bill. We don't know where that goes, but that's really not relevant, of course, to highway funding, at least directly. So we're probably more optimistic today than we've been in several years that something is about to happen with respect to a formal highway bill, albeit, probably only through the end of FY '13 at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","First question is for John. I was wondering if you could identify how much of the $25 million in the Profit Enhancement program for 2012 has been realized so far. Maybe it's a little bit too early to see the full benefit, obviously, but can you identify how much was in the first quarter numbers?","John R. McPherson","It is a bit early to figure out exactly how much of the first quarter and to hit the first quarter numbers, but let me answer you this way. We are well on track to the $25 million target for the current year. A number of those actions have not only been identified but are already put into place. The only thing that's slightly difficult in the first quarter is tracking how much each one has hit the P&L so far. That will become much easier in the second quarter. And that's simply a function of things like renegotiating vendor contracts or certain other internal practice changes that take some time to flow through our operations and hit the P&L. It's a timing question, that's all. But we are very much on track for the big goals that we've set.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So we should see maybe a more concrete number after the second quarter?","John R. McPherson","I think so. And I think with each quarter succeeding that also.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then just my last question, just for clarification. The $6 million in asset gains, is that part of the $29 million that you had identified as part of your EBITDA?","Donald M. James","It is.","John R. McPherson","Yes, it is.","Donald M. James","That is a -- that's the sale of a parcel of the California real estate. We have another parcel of California real estate for about $23 million in gain, which accounts for the $29 million that's in the $500 million of EBITDA for the year. But those are outside the Planned Assets Sales group because those things were well underway last year.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, that makes sense. And then, I guess just looking at the cash flow statement, there was about $17.9 million in net gain of sale property. Can you just provide a bit more color what that was?","Daniel Sansone","Garik, the biggest piece of that is the cash payment we received on the earn-out from the sale of our chemicals business. That was about $12 million or $13 million that came in the first quarter. Under the accounting rules, the payment of that earn-out gets categorized on the cash flow statement as cash proceeds from the sale of the business even though we actually sold the business in 2005. We have one more year under that earn-out, so there should hopefully be a payment in the first quarter of 2013, then that will go way.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great.","Donald M. James","And that flows through discontinued operations.","Daniel Sansone","The income effect of it flows through discontinued ops.","Donald M. James","It's not in our continuing ops.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rodny Nacier with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the update on the federal funding picture. Looking more at the local level, muni bond issues across the state, they increased about 60% in the first quarter. And that was up 100% for transportation. From your perspective, are those capital raises offsetting declines in other revenue sources? Or are they adding to state and local budgets? And when could we see that start to trickle through to your business?","Donald M. James","Well, I think the way many state and local governments, but particularly states, are now funding really critical highway needs are through bond issues. California, obviously, has been doing that for several years now. And as I indicated, our volumes for going into highway construction in California have been strong for several consecutive quarters. As you go state-by-state, I think we are seeing states, in many cases, not all, but in many cases, stepping up to address the lack of certainty in federal funding, and they are doing that through municipal bond issues. As you know, 100% of the proceeds of bond issues have to go to capital projects. They can't be used for operating. So it's virtually all construction. Every dollar from bond issues goes into some form of capital project, the vast majority of that being construction, whether it's highways or water and sewer or transit or public buildings. But that's a very positive sign. Whether -- and I -- you probably see the Rockefeller numbers, but state and local tax receipts, I think, are now back to where they were at the peak of the last cycle, which is helping. That\u2019s certainly -- not every state and local government is that way, but on balance, on average, that's improving. And I think we'll probably see a slightly larger proportion of highway work being funded by state and local sources than we have seen over the last 3 or 4 years.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I mean with some of the strength then that we're seeing just from the state and local funding sources, did it diminish, in your perspective, the lack of agreement coming out of D.C. around the federal funding picture?","Donald M. James","Yes. I think on balance, a driver for many states is that they have needs. And there's not enough money coming out of the federal program to meet those needs, and the states are coming up with their own funding mechanisms, and it's all over the board to try to address the infrastructure needs in those locations, particularly highway congestion and poor highway conditions.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And you mentioned California. And we've seen for several quarters now, you've had some strength in that state. Focusing on your Asphalt business, which I believe is mostly in California as well, you're expecting modest volume growth this year and volumes only grew modestly last year. When can we start to see perhaps some acceleration in demand for your Asphalt business out of California, given some of the strength we've seen on the Aggregates side?","Donald M. James","Well, our Asphalt business in California has continued to grow. It hasn't grown as fast as our Aggregates business, but certainly, it has been growing over time. But the big, as you point out, the big jump in demand has been in Aggregates and -- but a corresponding growth in Asphalt. We have a very good Asphalt business in California. I don't -- we're not projecting a large growth in volume in California this year, but we certainly believe that we will improve our material margins there as our pricing for asphalt mix begins to catch up with the higher costs of liquid asphalt that we have incurred over the past 9 months or so.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I have one last question, then I'll jump back in queue. The $500 million EBITDA number, would that compare to the $46 million adjusted this quarter or the $42 million GAAP?","Donald M. James","I think the $40 million -- yes, if you take the $46 million and add back the $6 million real estate gain, that's in the $500 million.","Daniel Sansone","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. On Asphalt, your guidance is looking for improved profitability there. Are the price increases in place now to kind of start to kind of catch up with what we've seen in liquid asphalt? Or how quickly should we expect to see kind of pricing catch up there with those costs?","Donald M. James","Well, we, certainly, as we are bidding work and as we have bid work over the last quarter or 2, are certainly taking into account the much higher cost of liquid asphalt. So I think the basic answer to your question is yes, those price increases are in place. Obviously, a lot of asphalt is actually shipped months after it is bid and quoted just because of the sequencing and the duration of large highway projects. But we are, as you know, and Trey, you've followed us for a long time, our material margins in Asphalt tend to shrink as liquid asphalt prices move up. And then as they turn down, our margin, material margins, tend to grow because there's a lag in -- we're paying essentially spot prices for liquid asphalt and we are contracting, in advance, prices for asphalt mix.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Sure, yes. I was just kind of trying to -- for modeling purposes, trying to figure out the best way to kind of approach the -- how that will roll out.","Donald M. James","Well, I think if you look at our full year guidance for our Asphalt business, it's probably -- it just probably takes all that into account, the ebbs and flows of liquid asphalt versus our settling price.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then volumes, Aggregate shipments up 10% in the first quarter. You moved the full year guidance up some, a couple of percentage points I believe, but is it safe to kind of look at 1Q as being, okay, this is a big quarter, there definitely was some weather impact, but as we kind of look into 2Q, you expect improvements but not the type that we saw in the first quarter. And is that going to kind of roll off as the year kind of progresses? Or is that kind of a quick kind of pullback in 2Q as far as the rate of growth?","Donald M. James","Well, let me answer it this way. The first quarter is so much more weather sensitive than Q2 and Q3, and to some extent, more weather sensitive than Q4. We can't quantify what the -- how many tons were sold in the first quarter because of good weather. I mean that's -- we just -- that's really impossible for us to do. We know there was a weather effect. The second fact is that the number of tons in the first quarter is substantially less than the number of tons sold in Q2 and Q3. So a lot fewer tons can account for a 10% bump, whereas when you go in Q2 and Q3, you can have the same earnings impact on a much lower percentage increase in shipments, if you're following where I'm trying to go.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Absolutely.","Donald M. James","And so our full year guidance is 2% to 4% increase in Aggregates shipments, including the 10% we got in the first quarter. But the earnings effect is -- since the tonnage is so much higher in Q2 and Q3, and the leverage we get from even a 2% to 4% volume gain is very significant for us. As you saw, literally, almost 100% of our revenue increase flowed through in gross profit. That's a combination of a lot of things, but we have a lot of leverage to volume and we're looking forward to enjoying that as the year moves forward.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Sure, okay. And my last question is, Don, if I heard you right, I think you said more than half of the -- half of your markets, I guess, realized the price improvements in the quarter. Can you talk, number one, just specifically where you're seeing the most strength? If I missed it, I apologize. And then secondly, is -- you saw more than half with improvements, but your pricing was down a little bit. And you pointed to the Virginia, the more fill material with that large project or projects. But is that -- the strength in those more than half, is that just offsetting the Virginia fill material more or are you -- or is there some markets that are actually seeing some softness in price?","Donald M. James","Well, I think our pricing in Virginia was down. It was in the top 1 or 2 markets in the average selling price being lower, and that was all driven by those sales of what I'll call non-spec product. I think there are 2 points, Trey. One is that the range of increase and decrease is narrowing, meaning there's more stability in pricing, both up and down, across most of our markets, which, on balance, at this point in the cycle, we think is a good thing. Clearly, if we -- if you factor out Virginia and get to neutral, we had as much downside in pricing across some markets as we had in upside. But we think coming out of the first quarter, for us to get to the full year 1 to 3 price improvement, we're going to see price improvement across many of our markets, the majority of our markets. But still, it's an ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter, really month-to-month, on what is shipped. And there are thousands of individual pricing decisions that are made every quarter. We're confident that pricing, overall, will move up instead of down. But there's still -- we need some additional volume growth before we start seeing a significant real price growth. And hopefully, that's coming with improved private sector construction as we look at these contract awards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I've got a number of questions, if I could. I'll try and limit it, but the first one, just a follow-on from that last answer. I'm looking at the CEMEX numbers today. They reported a 6% increase in Aggregate prices, Q1-on-Q1 last year. I mean, I gather or presume you don't want to give us the detailed pricing by state, but from when you look at that, can you see any reason why they should be so different given they're very California and Florida biased as well?","Donald M. James","Mike, I haven't studied their release yet, but I don't have an answer to your question.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, no worries. My second question, just on the operating leverage, which obviously was very good in Q1 on the Aggregates business, as you said, almost 100%, was any of that benefiting from the fact that some of the stone that was more than 12 months in inventory, some of this base fill, you were able to put through the books at almost nothing? Was that a factor at all in that very high operating leverage in Q1?","Daniel Sansone","Mike, this is Dan. No, that -- the level of that was consistent with prior periods. That has not been -- that was not an issue for us as volumes were declining because we managed our inventories and production rates down accordingly, and we do not expect that to be a distortive impact on the uptick either.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just maybe a final one on Cement, that nobody's talked about yet. I realize it's small, but it was a very good result in Q1. The volumes were particularly high. Were there any exceptionals or one-offs in that?","Donald M. James","I'll let Danny Shepherd take that.","Danny R. Shepherd","Yes. Actually, our sales volumes were up, Mike. But at the same time, we had a good quarter from a cost point of view. And we anticipate our Cement business this year showing improvement, a slight improvement.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Was the plant down for maintenance last year and not down for maintenance this year, for example?","Danny R. Shepherd","It was down partially in the first quarter of last year. This year, we didn't have an outage. But we believe our kilns are well maintained and we\u2019re pleased that we didn't have to take an outage in the first quarter.","Donald M. James","We have built in an outage in our full year projection.","Danny R. Shepherd","We have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Just really one question for today related to your Aggregate margins. Once again, just trying to get a better understanding of how much did volume versus pricing versus cost cutting impact the quarter. I know you addressed some on the cost-cutting side earlier in the call, but maybe a better understanding of what, for the second quarter in a row, is helping to drive margin improvement.","Donald M. James","It is in the operating leverage of our business. That is being able to run our plants at higher volumes really has a significant impact on our productivity, labor productivity, energy productivity. Obviously, selling prices didn't have a positive effect on Aggregates earnings, but costs and so much of cost is tied to volume. I think the volume increase was the real driver for our improved -- and the flow-through of revenue to gross profit.","Daniel Sansone","Kathryn, let me try to just provide a little more color on that. If you look at our variable costs of production in the quarter, they declined as compared -- on a unit basis as compared to our variable costs of production in the first quarter of last year. And as Don mentioned, that was predominantly labor efficiency offsetting diesel fuel. Our cash period costs, and period costs in our way of -- in our terminology is your fixed costs. Those -- the spending at the cash period costs level was flat year-over-year, so we've got 10% additional volume. So that same level of cash spending is being spread over more tons. And if you look at the supplemental schedules, you'll see that our depreciation expense in the various business segments is declining as well. So the dollars of non-cash fixed expense are being -- are not only declining, but being spread over a larger amount of tons. I should also point out that in the quarter, we also reduced our units of Aggregates inventory as well by several million tons. So we got this level of operating leverage on a level of production that was less, that increased less than the increase in the level of sales. So again, I think it's a further illustration of both the disciplined working capital management by our operating guys and the inherent profitability of this business as it comes into recovery.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Of that inventory that was reduced, could you describe, is it more base-type rock or other...","Daniel Sansone","It would be across the board. It would represent the full array of product mix in kind of normal production splits. No single category jumped out.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Okay. And also in terms of weather certainly has helped the last couple of quarters, how much do you think mild weather has pulled forward demand and what are trends then as we've gone into April? And would that give any indication of a pull forward of demand?","Donald M. James","Kathryn, I don't think we have good metrics on that. It is -- we do believe there was a weather effect in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year. I don't think -- it's too early to say whether it's going to have a chilling effect on second quarter volume at this point. We don't think so because we think the underlying demand is improving, particularly in the private sector. And that's really the reason that volumes are moving up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Judy Merrick","Actually, this is Judy Merrick for Keith. And just to clarify on your EBITDA guidance, you talked about that all excluding the gains from the asset sales. Will you give us any information on the impact of the EBITDA contribution from these asset sales? Or what sort of matter -- the mix of what's real estate and what's not going forward?","Donald M. James","The EBITDA contribution from asset sales would vary greatly depending upon what we sell. And so for -- and as Danny Shepherd and others have talked about previously, we have a large portfolio of assets that we would be willing to sell. We are really looking for the right buyer at the right price. You saw that our ready-mixed business in the quarter, I think, operated at a $12 million loss. So if we sell ready-mixed assets, we could get a double pickup on EBITDA. That is by avoiding loss, as well as if we have a gain on sale. So it's too early for us to give you predictions as to that, but we will certainly give you, as transactions close, we will give you the specifics of the EBITDA and EPS impact of those transactions, as we do with our routine real estate transactions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just quickly on California as a follow-up to a previous question. But how much of that improvement you're seeing as there is being driven by highway sort of infrastructure work versus private sector activities?","Donald M. James","I think most of it is highways. But our volumes in California are up substantially and have been for the last year or so, and it's largely highways.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. So still waiting for that next leg on the private sector?","Donald M. James","Yes.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I apologize if you've answered this before. But on the portfolio of sort of Planned Asset Sales that you have, when that's completed, should that change how we sort of currently think about your more key states and exposure?","Donald M. James","To the extent we sell ready-mixed assets, it could reduce the revenue from large states. If, for example, we sold some Concrete assets in California, since Concrete sells for a much higher unit price than Aggregates, yes, it could change the revenue. But that's really not important as to our market presence and our market penetration. We would continue to sell Aggregates to Concrete if we sold the Concrete. And our profitability per dollar revenue would be enhanced, if that gets to your question.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","That's what I needed.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Don James for any closing remarks.","Donald M.

A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website.","Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. As you saw in our earnings release, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a major impact on Vulcan's operations and results and this occurred across a significant portion of our more profitable markets. Absent these hurricanes, our results would have been in line with the expectations set forth in our second quarter call.","Adjusting for the extreme and prolonged bad weather, our daily shipments rates in our Aggregates segment, for example, were up at least 7% in August and September over August and September of last year. Looking ahead to 2018, we see the conditions in place for a continued gradual recovery in materials demand, for solid organic growth in our shipments and for return to the incremental flow-throughs and compounding unit margin improvements that have characterized our business for quite some time.","I'll now share a bit more insight into the quarter and underlying trends and then John will touch on some preliminary perspectives as we look ahead to 2018. The quarter's extreme weather impacted our shipments and margins significantly, disrupting operations from Texas across the Southeast. This included shipments from our Calica quarry in Mexico.","We estimate that the aggregates shipments were lower by at least 1.5 million tons during the quarter. In addition to the immediate impact of shipping days lost due to evacuations, storms and extended power outages, we and our customers have been working through the lingering effects of labor market disruptions, haul truck shortages and other logistical challenges. This has been in addition to the necessity of prioritizing debris removal and other recovery work.","The storms also impacted our reporting pricing and margins, particularly in our Aggregates segment. Part of the effect can be attributed to geographic mix as we lost volume in several of our more profitable markets and operations. But we also experienced higher energy costs and lower labor and production efficiencies. And we experienced lower utilization rates of our ships and other distribution assets along with a series of storm-related repair costs.","In certain cases, the impacts of the storms on our margins were exacerbated by the operating decisions we had made in anticipation of strong shipment growth. For example, we had recently added to our staffing levels at a number of facilities which then experienced significant shutdowns or drops in production versus plan. The storm's impacts have been far reaching. After Harvey, for example, our business in Phoenix experienced pressure on sales volumes due to a shortage of haul trucks. Drivers almost immediately had shifted to Houston to service FEMA's debris removal work.","Although our plant operations did not suffer any lasting damage from the hurricanes, these were major events. And it will take some time for our business in coastal Texas and other Gulf Coast states, including all of Florida, to return to normal. Now we're back serving our customers across these markets, but we're shipping a different mix of material and generally a lower price\/mix of material to different sorts of jobs than prior to the storms.","In addition, we and our customers in these markets continue to face tight labor and logistical constraints. It is certainly possible that the recovery work associated with these storms will generate incremental demand for our materials over time. For example, a number of key legislative leaders in Texas are pressing for significant investment in flood control infrastructure. But for the balance of 2017, we don't expect to fully recover shipments lost in the third quarter.","Certain markets, including coastal Texas, the Gulf Coast and Florida, continued to experience a drag on growth and unit profitability into the fourth quarter. As a result, we now expect full year aggregates shipments of 181 million tons and full year EBITDA of $1 billion. But the underlying trends and the very attractive fundamentals of our business remain unchanged. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, our daily shipment rates in August and September, adjusting for hurricane impacts, were consistent with the 5% to 10% balance of the year expectation discussed in our second quarter call.","Public construction activity has disappointed in 2017 as state DOTs and contractors have struggled for a wide range of reasons to meet schedules. But given the shift to higher levels of legislated and dedicated transportation infrastructure funding, this would appear to be a temporary decline before an extended period of growth. From today's levels, demand has much further to recover and our shipments have much further to grow.","The pricing climate also remains constructive, with pricing improvements consistent and widespread across the business. Trailing 12-month average selling prices have improved in 15 of our 19 general manager areas. Adjusted for mix and acquisition impacts, freight-adjusted average selling prices year-to-date have increased approximately 5% over the prior year. In terms of core profitability, on a same-store basis, while third quarter gross profit per ton was essentially flat, our cash gross profit per ton in our key legacy Aggregates segments was a third quarter record of $6.45 and that's despite the headwinds I've mentioned.","In short, we remain well set up to convert incremental materials demand into incremental earnings and cash flow growth. And last but hardly least, as another indicator of the quality of our local performance, our safety results for the third quarter represented a new record for the company. Our 2017 MSHA\/OSHA reportable injuries have dropped by a third compared to last year. Our MSHA incident rate is approximately half that of the industry rate. That's a world class achievement and a credit to our people who are focused on superior safety performance just as they are focused on superior operating performance every day.","Now, I'll hand it over to John to cover some of our preliminary thinking about our positioning heading into 2018.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom. Before commenting on 2018, we'd like to clarify that our planning process for next year remains in its initial stages. Right now, we're frankly focused on finishing the current year strong. So we'll give guidance for 2018 during our next earnings call and not today. But we thought it would be helpful to share some early thoughts regarding how we currently see the stage being set for next year.","Starting with the demand environment, we currently see mid-single-digit growth in 2018 over 2017. The recovery in private construction activity remains strong across the vast majority of our portfolio. And public construction demand appears to be firming up with most markets poised for low single-digit growth in 2018, a clear and positive contrast with the relative weakness experienced in 2016 and 2017.","With respect to public construction, a key will remain the pace at which state DOTs and contractors can start and complete planned work and work deferred from 2017. Our backlogs and our order flows relative to public construction work, particularly highways, continue to build, suggesting some upside to the current outlook if delays experienced in 2017 don't repeat in 2018.","And, certainly, we'd hope for some normalization of weather in 2018 leading to an effective gain in the number of available construction and materials shipment days. Breaking it down geographically, 2018 may be a year of haves and have-nots. The have-nots would include Illinois, Kentucky and Alabama. These states combined may see modest declines in demand due primarily to weak public spending. Opportunities for price gains in these states may also be limited.","Our other states, the haves, would appear poised to see growth in both private and public demand, with private being the larger driver of 2018 shipment growth. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida and California should all see demand continue to recover toward longer-term norms. And although further along in its recovery, we anticipate continued growth in Texas, driven by ongoing growth in private demand, along with several large highway projects recently booked.","We expect the pricing climate to remain positive across these states also, although some may see a more moderate rate of expansion as individual markets adjust after multiple years of steady increases. Georgia, in particular, should benefit from a strong combination of public and private demand growth in 2018. California demand also looks poised to continue its recovery, with 2018 driven mostly by private work, with the benefits of new public funding coming late in the year and into 2019 and beyond. Given this visibility, California pricing for heavy materials should continue to improve at a healthy pace.","From a cost and profitability perspective, certain of the headwinds experienced in 2017 should not repeat in 2018. Examples would include costs related to transitioning to our new ships, costs related to California floods and wildfires and, of course, the costs Tom referred to relating to the recent hurricanes. So, as Tom mentioned, the business should be well-positioned to convert even mid-single digit demand growth into solid organic growth in earnings and cash flows. And the business should also benefit moving forward from the capital allocation decisions we've made over the past few years.","During 2017, we expect to reinvest approximately $300 million into core operating CapEx, consistent with our prior guidance. During 2016, we reinvested approximately $250 million. These investments improve the longer-term efficiency, capacity and flexibility of our production and support strong customer service. Having made these investments over the past few years, we expect the level of reinvestment per ton of production to moderate moving forward.","Core operating CapEx in 2018 may be lower than in 2017. Our growth capital investments have also performed well. For example, acquisitions closed since the beginning of 2016 with a total consideration of approximately $245 million should contribute approximately $35 million to our EBITDA in 2018. To clarify, these figures do not include any impact from our announced transaction with Aggregates USA.","With the close of the Aggregates USA transaction, we will have invested over $1.5 billion in long-term growth since 2013, while further strengthening our portfolio through divestitures and swaps. And while making these investments, we've maintained an investment grade credit position consistent with our stated goals, while extending the weighted average duration of our debt, lowering the weighted average interest rate and retaining excellent liquidity. We retain the flexibility to fund smart growth investments, internal and external, as we move forward.","Tom, back over to you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, John. Let me continue briefly on the topic of capital allocation and specifically growth investments. As we all know, our industry has seen a good bit of M&A activity recently. The long-term growth prospects for heavy materials in the U.S. attract capital from around the world.","At Vulcan, we continue to evaluate a number of M&A opportunities and we're also pursuing a target set of greenfield core investments and expansions to our distribution network. But, as you heard me say before, we're going to remain disciplined. We're going to stay focused on those assets for which we are the best owner. We're going to remain patient and disciplined when it comes to valuation and we're going to create and capture the synergies.","Our planned acquisition of Aggregates USA fits our criteria for investment. The DOJ review continues to move forward as expected. As we noted when the transaction was announced, we anticipate divesting the Tennessee assets. We're hopeful that the transaction will close during the fourth quarter and we look forward to discussing this transaction in more detail once it is closed. Now, I'd like to close our prepared remarks with a quick look again at the fundamentals.","After a quarter so disrupted by hurricanes, it may be helpful to step back and consider the dynamics of the business we're in and where we stand currently. In the trailing 12 months, we've shipped 180 million tons. Now prior to The Great Recession, you have to go back nearly 20 years to 1998 to find a year when our shipments were so low a level. And in the meantime, we've seen nearly 20 years of economic and population growth in our markets, where we've continued to grow strategically with an eye on the long game. So, obviously, we see big upside as demand returns to levels that are defined normal consumption patterns over multiple decades.","And not only do we have the benefit of our 2017 asset base, we also have the benefit of our 2017 margin structure. Our gross profit per ton today is $4.78 versus $2.11 in 1998. That's about a 4.4% compounded annual improvement in unit profitability over that nearly 20-year period. These are strong fundamentals of our basic but essential construction aggregates franchise and they haven't changed. If anything they've strengthened, thus, our focus on organic growth and discipline and local execution and our focus on continuous compounding improvements to our customer service and our unit profitability.","All of the fundamentals for strengthening demand are in place. Private construction in our markets remains strong. And while public construction has been a disappointment in 2017, the need and the demand is there. And the legislation and funding is in place and growing in many of our best markets. As we head into 2018, we have more visibility regarding that demand.","And now, we'll be happy to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question today from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. First question is just on the preliminary outlook for 2018 actually, just wondering on the cost side. Is it possible to quantify the costs that you believe will not repeat in 2018 and what that potential benefit might be?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Garik, it's John. I'll start, but I think right now, it's not \u2013 I think it's a little bit early to do that. We'll try to be maybe a little more clear when we gave official guidance in February. What I would say is we clearly did not see any reason that with a return to even moderate shipment growth we won't return to the 60% flow-throughs and continuous compounding improvement in unit margin that really characterize our aggregates franchise. So \u2013 and certainly there should be some opportunity for improvement. I think that goes without saying. But I think it'd be inappropriate a little bit early to try and quantify right now.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's fair. Just wanted to -","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","To give total color on that. I think what we won't see is, as we said in the statements the impact of the ships \u2013 obviously we're not going to see the impact of the storms, which were very disruptive for us.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, exactly. And my question I think was trying to address, if there was a dollar amount attached to the ships and the storms and the fires in California, but understand if it's a little bit early to provide specifics around that. I guess, secondly, is on the price\/mix headwinds that you called out in the third quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit more how to think about that into the fourth quarter and then maybe even to 2018? How long you would anticipate some of those headwinds to persist on the pricing side?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think in a short period of time, any number of things could affect pricing. That could be product mix, geographic mix, timing of jobs and even the impact of two big storms. I think the key fact when it comes to pricing is that the fundamentals of pricing of aggregates hasn't changed and it's probably better now. You've got to remember as we always say that pricing is an ultra-local business and that local pricing is a campaign that compounds over time. If you look at the slides that we had for this call we've seen price increases every month for the past five years. On a trailing 12-month basis the price has gone up. And that's just a great example of that campaign. But to put a little color on it for you, let me contrast some markets. If you look at Georgia, which is one of our strongest markets both in the public side and the private side, even though volumes have been out a little bit, we saw \u2013 due to timing of jobs and the weather impact, we've seen pricing up double-digit in 2016 and double-digit in 2017.","And you contrast that to coastal Texas, where we're further along in the cycle. In fact, we saw \u2013 a number of reasons over the last 18 months we saw business probably dip some there. We've seen high single-digit pricing every year for five years till 2017, saw it tail off a little bit in 2017, but believe that it will pick right back up in 2018. And then you contrast that to California, which is in the relatively early stages of recovery with the private side healthy, the public side has not come on, but coming on, we've seen \u2013 over the last two years, we've seen high single-digit range to low double-digit pricing. And we'll see very good pricing there in 2018. So, as we always say, remember that pricing is a \u2013 it's ultra-local. It's a campaign over time. And the proof of that is that slide where you see very month pricing improvement over five years. So I think, from our perspective, we're very confident that the fundamentals of pricing improvement are sound.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then my last question is just you called out California and Georgia both in the prepared remarks and just now as being strong markets. You also talked about labor constraints as impacting the level of volume growth in 2017. Just wondering if there is any risk that you could see with respect to labor in those two states as impacting demand into the next year. Or from that standpoint or from a timing standpoint, do you see relatively less risk in those states despite the growth outlook?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Garik, I'll start. On Georgia, we'll be coming off a year that had \u2013 it was very disappointing in Georgia on the public side and much of that work deferred into next year. So, assuming that some of the same extraneous events don't happen in 2018 that happened in 2017, storms, major interchange, burning down, those kind of things, I think, by the time we work it through off the lower base, we should be okay. The challenge I think in Georgia as we look at it \u2013 and I think the same is probably true for California at these levels \u2013 is less labor constraint, per se, and more about normalization of weather, a number of available days, and a little bit more just about the success the DOT and large contractors are going to have in getting scheduled work started and done.","And labor is a part of that, but so is permitting, so is a variety of other things. And so that's what we'll be really keeping a close eye on in those two markets and the many others as we move between now and giving official guidance is what can we see on the public side that relates to work not just being funded, not just being scheduled, not just being slated, but actually moving dirt and taking shipments from us. And that's what we'll be keeping a close eye on.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We take our next question from Trey Grooms of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","I guess my first one is on obviously the impact of the storms in the third quarter. And then you noted or I guess in the press release you noted that it's a lingering effect that you're seeing. I mean it's not surprising that that's impacting 4Q, but what's the expectation as far as how long that can kind of go on, this lingering effect that you call out? I mean you think most of it will be behind us in the 4Q or could that kind of inch its way into next year as well?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think let me talk a little about those effects for a minute. They're pretty hard to quantify, but I'll try to give you some color on it. We're still seeing some impact on shipments of product splits across a number of our markets and to give \u2013 really in the residential sector. So, we're just not shipping \u2013 or our customers, our ready-mix customers, aren't shipping like they were before the storm really to residential, some non-res, mainly residential. And I'm sure that's a mix of where the labor is and just getting back to normal.","So some volume and some price impact there. Cost continues to be impacted. For example, we have the light load or split ships in the Houston, Beaumont today. We're waiting to dredge those two facilities from the storm. That dredging cost is going to be $2 million plus and we don't know when we're going to get them dredged just because there's that much pressure and demand to get everything dredged from the Gulf Coast. So while it's hard to quantify, we're still being impacted. I believe this will work out. I don't think it will drag much impact into 2018. I think it will be worked out in the next 60 days.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Trey, as I'm sure you and many others well know, while we are back shipping in many of these affected markets, we are not shipping the same product mix to do the same type of jobs. And so it will take a while. We think it will be mostly worked through in Q4. So we're back and operational but it's not like life is back to normal for the people who are displaced out of their homes in Houston, for example.","The only thing I would say, Trey, just on guidance for the balance of the year. Those lingering effects are certainly one of the reasons that we reduced guidance. Obviously, third quarter results contributed. Q4 will be impacted. At least early October is impacted by Tropical Storm Nate. So, you take the lingering effects, you take Nate, you take the normal uncertainty around fourth quarter weather and those were all the things that kind of contributed to our lowering our guidance to the place we did.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. And just \u2013 I don't know if you can give any color around this, but the guidance for volume that's implied in the 4Q kind of, I guess, low single-digit type volume. Can you take a stab at what might that have looked like excluding these things in the 4Q or the impact of these things in the 4Q? I mean you were able to kind of strip it out a little bit for August and September. Didn't know if there was any color you could give us on your -","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think it would be back toward the guidance we gave you in the second quarter and what we saw in the first couple weeks of August. And we were excited about that, saw some of the big jobs have been waiting on start-up. So, I think we'd have been within that second quarter guidance.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Which was -","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So, Trey, that's for 5% to 10% up over the prior year. That's kind of what we see is the underlying momentum in those periods of time when you can get a clean look at it.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Got it. Okay. And then lastly for me, on the 2018 kind of outlook for the demand environment I just want to be sure. I understand mid-single-digit demand growth for aggregates. That's in your market specifically, if I understand right. Is that kind of the view there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","And then with you guys and the M&A that you've done \u2013 not talking about Aggregates USA, but the other M&A that you've already closed presumably you guys would \u2013 if for no other reason simply from the M&A standpoint you should outperform the overall end market at minimum because of that, right?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's it for me. I'll pass it on. Thanks a lot guys and good-bye.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We take our next question from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Jerry.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hey, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I'm wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing on the highway side. I guess overall it's our perception that activity levels in terms of capital actually getting spent this year was generally light despite very strong DOT budgets. And I'm just wondering what's your assessment on what's driving the delay in terms of appropriations translating into a meaningful pick-up in highway activity for your business. What do you expect that to look like in 2018?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. As you know, that's been a frustration for us in 2017 and one that we thought would have shift or would have flowed through the FAST Act some of the DOT funding would have flowed through earlier in 2017. Our miss in 2017 was the public work. The private side of the business was very strong, very good. It's up and will be up in 2018. If you look at the public side today, I think, our visibility is a lot better than it was a year ago. Our public backlogs are up considerably and our order flows are up and improving on public work. And we began shipping on a number of the large jobs that we had anticipated shipping much earlier in the year. So I believe and I know our visibility to public work for 2018 is much improved.","I could give you a list of 10 major projects around the country, which we thought would have shipped second quarter, at least beginning of third quarter, but are now shipping. Three examples I'll give you would be I-85 widening in Charlotte, which is over 1 million tons. The much talked about 285\/400 interchange in Atlanta is now shipping. That's a multi-million \u2013 that's 2 million ton job. And then we've also in the past talked about I-16 and 75 widening in Macon got delayed due to right-of-way issues and also some permitting issues. That's a 0.5 million ton done, which we now began shipping. So, with shipping all these jobs, our timing, our insight, our visibility of timing and the pace of shipping is much clearer than maybe what was six to 12 months ago.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And I'm wondering if you folks can comment on California specifically where we've heard some optimism that the SB 1 bill could translate into spending sooner than initially anticipated based on how tax revenue collection is going and the urgency to put capital in the ground. Based on what you're seeing when do you think you start to see the benefit of SB 1 in your business?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think California really is exciting place for us and, again, the private side is strong, been strong. Both non-res and res are very healthy there. And now we've got SB 1. Back in the summer, Caltrans announced $1 billion of accelerated funding. And then, in October, they announced the 90 fix-it-first transportation, or $3.4 billion of accelerated spending. And that second announcement includes 1,200 lane miles of pavement, replacing or repairing 66 bridges, and a number of like 300 culvert and drainage repairs or replacements. Most of that will come \u2013 you'll see a little bit of that probably in 2018, most will come 2019 and 2020. Obviously overlays will go faster but I think with all of this remember it takes normally two years to flow through. We've seen it in a number of bills. Now they'll get some of that accelerated and start shipping because there's a lot of public pressure to fix the roads in California.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So, Jerry, just to help you with the math on that a little bit and others. As we look toward 2018, California shipment growth is still driven almost entirely by private growth in our current outlook. The efforts at Caltrans to pull projects forward are very good news, but pulling them forward doesn't mean we're shipping on them in early 2018. It means they're starting the work on the project. And so should benefit us maybe some late in the year. But it's not something that we have baked in for 2018, if you will.","Back on California, stepping back just a little bit, we continue to think California looks a lot like Texas did four or five years ago. And as you heard Tom say and you heard me say, that's reflected in what should be a pretty darn constructive pricing climate, not only for our products, but for all heavy materials in California as we look toward next year. And it's really at that different stage of the cycle, so we're excited about it. But 2018 will still be largely private-oriented. Maybe with a little bit of upside if the public comes a little bit sooner but we think that's more 2019, 2020 and for many years beyond.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Phil Ng of Jefferies has our next question. Please go ahead.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","You called out project delays and logistical issues at the DOT last quarter. Have you seen any improvement on that front and any lift from FAST? It doesn't sound like there's much. And, separately, you're calling for a low single-digit growth in public spending next year. Is that generally in line with what you expected coming into the year? Thanks.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll kind of play back the story on expectations because again, I think, the theme is that in 2017 public has been the disappointment. At the beginning of 2017, we and others would have expected mid-single digit growth in public demand. What we have seen in 2017 and probably will have seen by the end of the year is mid-single digit decline in demand. So, as Tom said, that's where the miss is.","The important thing is as we look to 2018 we actually see firming up and a return to growth in public spending and public demand across really all of our footprint, with the exceptions that I noted of Alabama, Kentucky, and Illinois.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And that's very good for the overall health of our business. We don't have in that mid-single digit growth outlook for next year, which again preliminary. We'll revise it between now and when we give official guidance. As you noted, that's not predicated on a huge jump in public spending. That's predicated on stabilized, low-mid, low-single-digit growth in public spending. So if people are able to get projects out the door more quickly, when that begins to accelerate, there could be a little bit of upside to that. But we don't see it happening certainly in the first half of 2018 yet. Something we'll keep a close eye on.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think back to our earlier comments is the visibility of the jobs that we've got started and that we know we're going to ship. And the ones that we haven't, we don't know yet. We just don't know the timing of them.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then I guess just one last one. I mean coming into the year, there's certainly a lot of euphoria with this administration pushing through an infrastructure bill. But just given some of the delays in \u2013 whether it's healthcare, tax reform, has that lack of clarity in D.C. led to any delays in projects and funding getting pushed out? Thanks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","No, it hasn't. And as we said before, this is something this country needs, and it's not a matter of if, but when. But in the meantime, we've got very good business. The private side has been growing, will continue to grow. We're starting to see the highway work flow through finally, and we're starting to see the FAST Act funding flow through. So when that comes, we'll welcome it with open arms, but in the meantime, I think, demand on both the private and the public side is helping.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group has our next question. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. I just want to first focus on gross margins. Could you walk through the puts and takes on the quarters? Really trying to get a better sense of what more is one-time versus the ongoing managed cost, particularly as related to storms. And I know you talked about it in the prepared commentary, but if you could put it around \u2013 some metrics that we can better understand for modeling purposes. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think just some color on that. Those storms were really disruptive. We've talked about it. From an operating perspective, you've got to remember. We had \u2013 operations were shut down days, even weeks. For example, the West Coast of Florida, our operations over there were shut down two or three weeks. Some of Georgia operations were shut down a week. And when you're down for that long, the costs don't go away. I mean we paid our folks during the evacuation just because it was the right thing to do. But those costs kept building up. So, anything specific we talk about is going to be conservative. I think that we're slowly getting back to normal on that. We'll work that through over the next couple of months, but that's really hard to quantify. John?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Kathryn, I'll try and give a little bit more quantification and color, but let me first say to everybody it's just inherently very difficult to quantify precisely because the nature of the impacts were so widespread and on so many aspects of the operations. But to try and give you a rough feel the way we look at it. You saw us note that we think we lost at least 1.5 million tons of production deferred, of shipments deferred. Just on the increment given where those are coming from, the nature of it, we think that's probably a $15 million to $20 million hit to EBITDA in the quarter.","But then let me go to the profitability of our Aggregates segments and to your point about margins. We think the hit there was probably of a equal and maybe larger size than just the straight volume loss. And this is a function of changes in product mix, changes in production efficiency, again in some cases having fully staff facilities where we kept everybody on the payroll that had no production for a couple weeks, which is very much the right thing to do, freight and logistics costs, unique spikes in diesel, unique spikes in freight costs, which in some cases we ate because we chose not to pass through to customers in the middle of a crisis, repair costs, lower fixed cost absorption, the spike in diesel and its usage in our facilities that you've seen, et cetera, et cetera.","So, on the cost side, we'd estimate that's another $15 million to $20 million. But that's an estimate in the quarter. When I say cost, I really mean profitability. Absent that effect, we probably would have grown unit margins, unit gross profit in our Ag segment another 5% to 8% quarter-over-quarter. Then if we go to our non-ag segments, probably about a $7 million to $8 million impact, particularly in our asphalt segment, particularly in San Antonio, which was hit hard economically. So that, I hope, gives you a feel, Kathryn. I just would underscore that it's more difficult than the average one or two items to quantify just because of the very nature of how disruptive this was.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Absolutely understand and I think you've seen us write about that too.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","The other thing \u2013 and it's extremely helpful in terms of that quantification. In terms of the optics for pricing in the quarter and once again this may be difficult to quantify, but when you look at your 3% pricing, what \u2013 any impact to that? Did the storms have effect to the optics of pricing understanding that you're shipping more base and fines versus clean stone into the affected markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think that it was definitely impacted. We just called out mix being about 1%, but that's \u2013 on the surface there was for price, other impacts with the storm that aren't seen there. And, again, we were very careful with our pricing, just because it was the wrong time to raise prices during when people are hurt and in trouble. So that probably had some drag on us also.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Perfect.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Kathryn, we can cover this offline if you wanted. But if you looked at our non-freight adjusted pricing, just total revenue per unit in ags, it was up probably 5% or 6%","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah. Saw that -","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Relative to our freight adjusted pricing up 3%. And, again, a lot of that was in a lot of these disruptive markets where we had kind of a spike in freight related cost, like an immediate spike that wasn't passed through the way it normally would be. So, there's also a little bit of cost and price impact there in some of these markets that's transitory. I think we'd probably say the overall pricing climate and trend \u2013 and, again, you know very well how variable it is by market. It's incredibly variable by market, but total, total across the portfolio tracking between 4% and 5%.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Perfect. Yeah. No, definitely understand that, and just really wanted to get a better understanding of that mix impact from the storm, so -","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Helpful. And then finally -","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And that mix impact \u2013 a question was asked earlier, that mix impact is not over. We'll still see some of that in Q4.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. And final question and I promise to get off the storm train. Just when you look at your recovery in Texas and Florida, we've gotten mixed feedbacks from a wide variety of different construction value-chain participants, be it ready-mix truck drivers to building project distributor in terms of the pace of recovery in each of the respective markets. But maybe could you frame a little bit more \u2013 are you seeing a fast recovery or a slow recovery you thought in Florida and in Texas, because that will help us? We think that the lingering effect could go beyond Q4 and so this is kind of what we were trying to get some comfort around. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think it's actually \u2013 I would tell you pretty slow, and it's dragging. I think that every day we get a little better with this. Labor markets get a little more normalized, debris gets picked up, and you start to have trucks available. Homebuilders and the thing that concerns us is probably the res side and when we start \u2013 when our ready \u2013 when our customers in the ready-mix business start shipping to residential. And I'm sure that there's no question there's labor constraints there with repairs and rebuilds to homes as well as new construction. So we're hoping that we get past this in 60 days, but you may be right there. We don't know. And I think like I said the biggest concern is what happens to shipments to res and the timing of that.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And in some markets -","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you very much.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Like Florida, asphalt paving is not really picked back up either. So, Kath, I think, it's fair to say that just to underscore that that there's certainly a degree of uncertainty. I'm not sure anybody knows. It's just a little bit the nature of what these communities are working out of. It's not about our quarry operations, but it can sometimes be about our customers operations.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thanks very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I swear to God I'm not going to ask a single question about the hurricane, okay. Enough of hurricane. Let's move into 2018, all right.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","All right.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, a lot of detail, forward-looking. I'm kind of feeling like we're 180 million shipment tons for this year and last year. I'm kind of understanding if there's pent-up demand and you're talking like mid-single-digit volume growth next year, that kind of gets me to 190 million tons. You've got some nice M&A that closes I guess end of 4Q, first quarter of 2018, maybe a couple million tons, maybe 5 million tons. Just for thinking and I'm not asking for an estimate or a crystal ball, is like 190 million to 200 million tons like a good conceptual starting point for 2018 given all of the issues we had this year with weather and hurricanes and all that stuff? And some of the comments you made about kind of widespread recovery except John's point there's three states which are kind of struggling. Is that the right way from a bookend perspective, big picture?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think, first of all, we're still working through that and we're still working on the plan. Some of that, as John said earlier, will depend on what happens with the public sector, how fast it goes, do some of those bottlenecks get cleared up? I think as far as the mid-single digit, we're very comfortable with that based on the projects we've seen start and the ones that we know and the timing of the ones that we know are going to go. A lot better than we were a year ago. But I think we're still working through that and trying to get out of the hurricane and into normal business.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Bob, we don't want to slide in to giving a number or giving guidance before we give guidance too much. I think I'll come back to private demand climate. It's still quite strong in Vulcan markets. By the way, if somebody wants to ask that includes non-res and non-res backlogs in our markets, certainly through 2018, res very strong across the entire footprint, public transportation, public highway work, strong across \u2013 well, not strong \u2013 strengthening after a period of lull and what we think is the beginning of a long wave of growth on the public transportation side.","The public \u2013 what we call public other infrastructure, water, sewer, some other things \u2013 not as strong and conspicuously weak throughout this entire recovery. But that's now 10% of our business, when it would normally be 15%. So it's not the big thing. So we absolutely see return to at least moderate growth with some upside. And I'd underscore that we haven't seen anything change in our view regarding our ability to convert that growth into good growth in operating earnings and cash flows.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I mean you guys have had a couple years where you've been growing volumes 15 million or 20 million tons. So I mean there is no question about your ability to leverage yourself when the demand returns. Maybe we could talk for a second about gross profit per ton. And obviously this year has had some disruption, which has weighed on that and impacted incremental margin performance. How do you feel what's \u2013 like, where can you take this, Tom, in terms if we get normalized demand patterns, what kind of gross margin per ton can we start looking for on a dollar basis?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","You'll hear us talk about the flow-throughs of 60% and that's what we'd tell you over time. Nothing has changed with that. We have confidence in that. I think we won't see some of the cost headwinds that we saw this year. John talked about those with the ships, some of the fuel spikes and obviously the cost of the storms and the destruction of the storms. So I think back to our normal flow-through.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So you feel good about continued improvement in profitability. Final question and pass it on. Am I right to detect a subtle shift in your capital allocation strategy? Because you guys spoke more and focused more on it during your prepared remarks. Is there any kind of tilt to how you're putting money back to work? And how should we be thinking about that for next year, 2018? Thanks and good luck.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good question, Bob. John. I don't think there is any change in strategy. In fact, it's very consistent with what we've been on for a long time. We did just want to note that on \u2013 we're still very focused on a free cash flow generation, and we think we should have accelerating free cash flow generation over time. As you hear Tom say all the time, we're going to stay disciplined on our deployment of capital back into M&A and other growth with an underscore of discipline.","But we do think that we've caught up on some amount of our, I'm going to call it, core maintenance and operating CapEx investments. We've made some very good investments there. And we'll talk about this more when we give guidance next year, but we'd expect our core maintenance operating CapEx number to maybe even next year be down a little bit despite production being up a little bit. We think that number will kind of moderate, but no change to our long-term outlook or certainly no change to the capital allocation disciplines we've been following for some time.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So you're saying EBITDA grows potentially but CapEx goes lower, so free cash flow strengthens, correct?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's awesome. Good luck. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis has our next question. Please go ahead.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","I wanted to ask first \u2013 you said mid-single digit volume growth expected for next year. Could pricing also be up mid-single digits or those three states you mentioned, does that drag down the average a bit?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think as you look at it, we're not there. We actually couldn't give you guidance, because we're still doing the work. But what I would repeat is that the environment for price increases is very healthy. We've got population growth. We've got employment growth. Our customers are growing their pricing and everybody recognizes that our business \u2013 we need to add to the profitability of it. So the environment is good. People see work out ahead of them. The visibility is very good, so they can take a risk on price all the way through the construction business, not just aggregates. So, while we won't put a number on that at this point, I'd tell you that the environment is good for price increases.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that, Tom. And as a follow up I'm just curious. What's your view on the M&A landscape in 2018? Do you see a moderation of the large deals and maybe just a few comments on your priorities for M&A?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Those deals will come and go, and you never can predict them. I mean we're working on a number of M&A opportunities as we speak, and they'll be all shapes and sizes, and you just can't predict that. When someone gets ready to sell, they're available. As always, I think, we're focused on the discipline about what markets we want to be in, what synergies do we have and are unique to us, and how we put them to work.","Obviously, you've got to be disciplined on what you're willing to pay for an acquisition. And then as important as anything, once you get it, you have to be disciplined about integrating it and making it profitable as fast as you can and make it a part of the Vulcan franchise and part of the Vulcan family as fast as you can. So, we're busy with that. There is deals working right now, but to predict size and number for 2018, really tough to do. I can tell you right now that the M&A part of our business is very busy.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Schrier of Citi. Please go ahead.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to talk specifically about Virginia a little bit. You continue to have a lot of strength and the right mix and I just want to see what you're seeing in the state both on the public and private side, whether you think that's going to continue and how you look at the pricing environment there? And I guess as a follow-up to the last question, how you'd view the M&A environment in the state of Virginia?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Virginia is strong. I think if we talk to you \u2013 in 2016, our weakness in Virginia was non-res. We predicted it coming back. It has come back. That has really added to our growth in ready-mix in Virginia. Res continues to be healthy and the public side is healthy. So really good market both from demand perspective and also from a pricing environment, both in all the way through the construction materials mix. I think aggregates prices have gone up for Virginia and will go up healthy in 2018 and we continue to see ready-mix prices and unit profitability grow in Virginia. It's a good market for us. And I think our folks are doing a really good job there.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And I wanted to touch real quick on the SAG expense. It looks pretty low. Just wanted to see if there is anything there and how you're looking at progress in SAG as we head into 2018.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Say, if I'll start on SAG, I don't know that we'd say it's low. We're never \u2013 we're always looking at it. It's an area of continued focus for us, both in leveraging at the sales going forward as we've talked about a good bit but also in terms of making sure SAG dollars are deployed against those things that better serve our customers, better serve our people and just drive productivity and performance over time. So, it's something we are intensively focused on here. We'd read it as good discipline, good focus in line, but I wouldn't say that our job in SAG is anywhere near done. We're going to continue to focus on it. We're making investments on the sales side, the S part of SAG, particularly to serve our customers better and to grow with the small private work we see and to make sure we participate in that part of the growth in the market fully and to do so at a full value for our products. And we're continuing to be very efficient on all of, what I'll call, the support function aspects of SAG. So, good result in the quarter, but an ongoing area of focus.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. Before I ask question, one just on clarification, so far as the Ag USA deal expecting to close kind of fourth quarter. I apologize if you have said it, but the level of divestiture that you were contemplating or discussing, all of that is kind of within that framework, meaning, just increasing the likelihood of getting that closed by year-end.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","We can't say a lot about Ag USA. The DOJ process continues to move forward as expected. We believe we'll close it in the \u2013 we believe we'll close Ag USA in the fourth quarter. Divestitures will be a part of that. We're also working really hard \u2013 and this is most important to us, pre-closing integration and what we can do to make sure we execute on the integration of that business. It is a very good business. We're excited about it. It's great assets in really good markets with really good market positions. They have really talented people and we're ready to get them on board with Vulcan.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Stan, just given the way you asked the question. We said when we announced that we didn't expect to be able to keep all the assets in Tennessee and we still don't expect to be able to keep all the assets in Tennessee. So no change really.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No. It sounds like it's moving according to plan.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I guess lastly you talked a little bit about some of the internal investments and then some of the new site developments. Is it easier to greenfield a quarry or to kind of work within on an organic basis in that regard? Has anything changed on that or is it just kind of more opportunistic kind of something you guys have been doing for a while?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks for the question. We are doing greenfields and M&A. Greenfields are very important part of our business. It is part of our strategic planning, something where we execute on and have been executing on over the last couple years. We have a number of greenfields working \u2013 quarries working right now and a even bigger number of distribution greenfield sites that we're working on or are finished. We don't talk a lot about those because of the strategy and the confidentiality of that but it is absolutely part of our business and a very important part of our strategy.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Stan, I think it's fair to say that it's harder not easier. And when we talk about things that are coming to fruition, almost without exception, they've been in the works for a decade. So, just keep that in mind if we're making announcement in 2018 about greenfield development that they've been in the works for a very long time. It is very hard to do.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, guys. Thanks and best of luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you for your time this morning. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We are excited about the growth opportunities we see ahead of us and we look forward to sharing that with you in our next call, another topic.

My name is Victoria, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.","Donald M. James","Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2013 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to you on the webcast.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's third quarter 2013 earnings release.","Turning now to Slide 3, I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. Our net sales increased 13% for the quarter, and gross profit increased 25%. EPS from continuing operations improved from $0.12 per share last year to $0.32 for this year's third quarter. Aggregate shipments increased 9% in total and 10% on a same-store basis, adjusted for the divestiture of our Wisconsin operations and the acquisitions of 3 bolt-on quarries in Georgia and Texas.","Volumes continued to be particularly strong in Florida and Texas, where shipments increased sharply compared to last year, up 36% and 29%, respectively. Aggregate volumes and other key markets, including Arizona, California, Georgia and North Carolina, all improved at least 14%. Some of the volume improvement relates to a recovery from the particularly wet weather we had in the first half of the year, which we've discussed in our prior conference calls.","Ready-mixed volumes were up sharply for the quarter and were higher in every market. Cement volumes were up on strength in Florida and asphalt shipments up 4%, were particularly strong in Texas and Southern California. On a freight adjusted basis, aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 2.4% or $0.26 per ton, to an average selling price of $10.89 per ton. This is the highest quarterly sales price in company history. Pricing in our ready-mix segment was up 2% for the quarter. Geographic mix had a slightly negative impact on ready-mix pricing, but all Vulcan states saw higher pricing. While asphalt pricing was almost flat, liquid lower asphalt cost resulted in increased materials margins. Vulcan served states continued to exceed the U.S. average in private construction activity. We have seen improvement in sales momentum and awards in a number of our states. Single-family starts are growing in virtually all markets. And key Vulcan states such as Texas, Florida, California and Virginia are seeing sharp demand growth in private nonresidential buildings.","Slide 4 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. Consolidated net sales increased $88 million and gross profit increased $32 million, as both the aggregates and non-aggregates segments reported year-over-year improvements in earnings. Gross profit margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA for the quarter was $180 million, an increase of $39 million from the prior year's third quarter. Included in 2013 EBITDA is a $9 million pretax gain on sale of reclaimed real estate. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.32 per quarter.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd, who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter.","Danny R. Shepherd","Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 5, you see a 9% increase in third quarter aggregate shipments. As often discussed, incremental volume has a significant impact to gross profit, and you can see this during the third quarter. This 9% increase in shipments or $3.4 million additional tons drove a $25 million improvement in aggregates gross profit or $7.35 per incremental tons sold. This attractive incremental margin per incremental ton of aggregates sold demonstrates the earnings leverage of our aggregates business. Non-aggregates earnings increased $7 million, due to improving private construction demand, which benefited concrete and cement volumes, and lower asphalt cost, which increased materials margins in asphalt. The concrete earnings improvement reflects higher shipments in pricing in all of the companies served states. Third quarter shipments of ready-mixed concrete increased 17% and pricing increased mid-single digits in most markets. Cement earnings were down slightly in the third quarter as the earnings effect of higher volumes was offset by higher repair cost associated with the timing this year of a scheduled field outage.","Now turning to Slide 6. You see that aggregates gross margins increased 130 basis points due to higher volumes and pricing. Aggregate shipments in a number of markets increased sharply versus the prior year. As you'll recall, wet weather had a significant impact in this year's first half. While the wet weather continued into July, we experienced the catch-up effect, as some shipments delayed due to weather were realized in the third quarter, contributing to higher volumes and margin expansion. Aggregates pricing improved 2.4% compared with the prior year. Most markets realized positive growth with year-over-year improvement ranging from low- to mid-single digits versus the prior year. Sharp increase in shipments this quarter led to a 2.8 million ton reduction in aggregates inventory at the quarries. Production levels that were below our level of shipments had a negative impact on total cost for the quarter. These actions negatively affected earnings by $6 million in the third quarter. Our current inventory levels provide opportunity for higher production levels and efficiencies, as demand continues to improve. Additionally, robust shipments to remote sales yards in response to growing demand along the Gulf Coast increased cost of sales $2 million, due to increased freight and distribution cost. Most key productivity and operating metrics improved versus the prior year. Labor productivity and energy efficiency improved, highlighting a solid quarter of cost management.","As shown on Slide 12, on a trailing 12-month basis, our cash gross profit was $4.24 per ton, 26% greater than it was at the prior peak and trailing 12-month shipments ending in the first quarter of 2006, and this is superior to that of our peers. Because of our disciplined approach to pricing and cost management, the earnings leverage in our aggregates business continues to increase. For the quarter, cash gross profit per ton of $4.83 was the highest third quarter level in company history and the highest of any quarter over the last 4 years. This higher unit profitability positions us well for greater earnings leverage from incremental aggregates tons, as demand continues to improve.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Don.","Donald M. James","Thanks, Danny. If you'll turn with me now to Slide 8. Strengthening our balance sheet remains a priority, and we are doing that through both debt reduction and improving EBITDA. During the past 12 months, we have reduced our total debt by $289 million while investing more than $100 million in strategic assets and reserves in Georgia, Texas and Virginia. During the same period, we have increased EBITDA by $137 million. As a result, net debt-to-EBITDA has improved from 6.9x a year ago to 4.5x as of the end of this quarter. We remain committed to further improvement.","Turning now to our end markets on Slide 9. This slide shows how private construction activity is currently fueling most of the recovery in demand. Trailing 12-month housing starts are up sharply, compared to the prior year, due to broad-based growth in both single-family and multifamily starts. Most Vulcan-served states realize double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 30. We are seeing particularly significant growth in key Vulcan-served states such as Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. Housing starts in those 5 states accounted for 36% of all growth in trailing 12-month housing starts in the United States. We are also encouraged by leading indicators of future activity for private nonresidential construction.","Trailing 12-month contract awards, as measured by square feet, for private non-res construction, are up 10% in the U.S. as a whole. Remarkably though, Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona are leading the way here as well, accounting for approximately 80% of all U.S. contract awards for private non-res construction, as measured in square feet. Growth in stores and office buildings, which for us, includes all commercial office and lodging, are the primary drivers. Growth in private construction activity in key Vulcan-served states, like Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona, is important, because not only will we realize the attractive incremental margins from higher aggregates volumes, but we also have non-aggregates businesses in those states that will benefit us well.","Year-to-date, concrete shipments demonstrate this expanding recovery in private construction, particularly residential construction. Through the first 9 months ending September 30, our concrete shipments were up 10% on a comparable basis to 2012. Highway construction is the largest end market for aggregates demand within public construction. New highway projects, as measured by trailing 12-month contract awards, were up 7% versus the prior year's level, as shown on Slide 9. This recent growth provides some evidence that the more stable and predictable highway funding environment has led to improving construction activity. The large increase in TIFIA funding contained in the Federal Highway Bill known as MAP-21 should also positively impact future demand. Contract awards for TIFIA projects are projected to add $30 billion to $50 billion, highway and infrastructure construction. Some TIFIA projects have been underway in 2013, but 2014 should be a much more significant year in shipments to TIFIA projects. The growth in new highway projects should help offset recent weakness in other public infrastructure, as shown on this slide. Last year, highways composed approximately 30% of full year aggregate shipments, while other public infrastructure accounted for less than half that amount.","Turning now to our outlook on Slide 10. Our outlook for operating earnings improvement in full year 2013 remains on track, and is supported by continued growth in private construction activity, which should drive volume growth, improved pricing and disciplined cost management. Year-to-date, aggregates volumes were consistent with our earlier expectations. However, the quarterly increases to get to this point have been more uneven due to the wet weather in the first half of the year. That said, growth in residential construction activity and its traditional follow-on impact on private nonresidential construction continues to underpin our expectations for future volume growth and earnings improvement.","As we look specifically to the remainder of 2013 and into 2014, the projects that could materially impact our aggregates volumes continue to include a disproportionately greater number of large highway and industrial projects. The timing of shipments to these projects remain outside our control, and in some cases, have been delayed into 2014 and 2015 due to project schedules. Full year reported aggregate shipments and pricing are expected to reflect the same growth rate as our year-to-date results through the first 9 months. Year-to-date reported aggregate shipments have increased 2% from the prior year, and same-store shipments have increased 3%, adjusted for the divestitures and acquisitions completed this year.","Forecasting shipments in the fourth quarter always contains an added level of uncertainty due to weather. Our expectation for shipment activity in the fourth quarter is based on normal weather patterns, which we have certainly enjoyed for most of the month of October. Year-to-date, freight-adjusted pricing has increased 3%, and we expect full year pricing growth to approximate this result. Full year concrete volumes, materials margins and earnings are expected to continue to improve, as housing and private nonresidential construction continues to improve in our key states.","Strong asphalt sales in Texas should drive full year shipments above 2012 levels. Materials margins are up over 10% year-to-date, and we expect continued earnings improvement in that segment. Cement earnings are ahead of -- on our year-to-date basis, on higher volume and improved pricing, and this trend is expected to continue through the remainder of the year. Finally, we continue to work on additional transactions that will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics, while redeploying capital into assets with higher returns.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","First question is on pricing. As you see broader-based recovery in volumes, and our research is showing you're seeing a greater number of new construction projects in particular, how does that impact pricing? And specifically, if you could talk about this quarter, how did mix impact pricing? How should we think about it going forward? And also, if you could clarify what markets were seeing the strongest price increases?","Donald M. James","Thank you, Kathryn. Clearly, the visibility of future demand, which we believe is out there, will help shore up our pricing and, I think, industry pricing generally. In terms of the quarter's pricing, we did have a fair amount of negative product mix impact in Florida and Georgia, where we -- in Georgia, we had some very high SMA, Stone Matrix Asphalt, pricing in last year's third quarter and we didn't have nearly as much of that in this quarter. And in Florida, our product mix shift was much more toward some base and shot rock compared to last year's third quarter, based on some large projects that we are currently shipping to. We are reasonably confident we will get to the 3% to 4% price growth full year. And as we look -- the last part of your question, Kathryn, had to do with geography. Pricing across our footprint certainly adjusted for the Georgia and Florida product mix shift, we were up in pricing across virtually the entire footprint. And that's very positive. We continue to believe there are opportunities for price growth supported, as you indicated in the first part of your question, by strong visibility of future demand, as we move into 2014.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","My second question is on aggregate inventories and reduction that you mentioned in the press release in your prepared comments. Do you have any clarity that you can pass on, on how much of the reduction was from base versus clean stone?","Donald M. James","I don't know the answer to that. I don't think there was a material difference in the product mix. Basically, what happened is we had a production plan for the quarter, shipments jumped up higher than we anticipated when we set the production plan and we just ended up shipping out of inventory about 3 million -- 3.2 million tons that we didn't get to produce. As we said in the press release, had we produced at the same level in the quarter that we shipped, our earnings on a pretax basis would have been about $6 million higher. So we're looking forward to the opportunities to run our plants at higher and more efficient production levels, as we move into 2014.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Great. And then finally, my final question is on margin -- volume side. We had noted that it'd been relatively weaker out east, and you're seeing some markets catch-up, notably Atlanta, Orlando and the Charlotte markets. What type of projects are you seeing out of markets that you're seeing recovery that previously had lacked?","Donald M. James","Well, it's a -- it's very market specific. But in Charlotte, we are supplying a good number of highway projects; in Florida, we are supplying a lot of large commercial-type projects, as well as much stronger housing demand. Housing is coming back in Atlanta, lot development is coming back. That's certainly the significant driver in housing. And in Virginia, particularly in Northern Virginia, around Washington, D.C., there's a tremendous amount of commercial construction. As you know, the East Coast has been -- was, during the first half, weak, largely because of bad weather. We had better weather in the West. But as we sit here today, we're seeing strong recovery in housing in Arizona. A big backlog, as we referenced in private non-res construction based on contract awards all across Sun Belt in California, Arizona, Texas, Florida and Georgia. And as I said, it is remarkable that 80% of the improvement in non-res contract awards is in 5 states for the entire U.S. So we're looking forward to significant opportunities as that end market, which is typically a follow on to residential construction appears to be performing as it has historically.","Operator","The next question is from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","First question is on the volume growth that you saw in the quarter. It seems like it exceeded your expectations. It came in faster and stronger than you thought. Is it possible to breakout, maybe, how much of the volume growth was coming from these large projects that you've cited over the last several quarters as potentially getting underway in the back half of the year, versus maybe a little bit more granularity on the pent-up demand that was from the volumes that were pushed out from the first half of the year to the second half? And I guess the third bucket would be just organic growth in your core market.","Donald M. James","Among the large projects we are tracking, some began to ship in 2013. Virtually all of them have very significant carryovers into 2014. The TIFIA projects, the Grand Parkway in Houston, the I-75\/I-575 Corridor in Atlanta, it will start in '14. We didn't ship any of that in '13. Most of the big projects -- most of the big TIFIA projects did not start in '13, but will start in '14. We have been shipping on some legacy TIFIA projects, particularly in Virginia, on I-95 during the course of the year. On industrial projects on the Gulf Coast, we have been shipping to several energy-related projects along the Gulf Coast. We referenced the fact that we were building -- or we did build inventory in our coastal markets. The majority of that build was coming by ship from Mexico, although we did our building inventory in some rail yards along the Gulf Coast. So that whole market had good shipments in 2013, and we expect that to continue in 2014.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So is it fair to assume that the majority of the strong volume in the quarter was coming from, as you mentioned, a pent-up demand and weather in the first half of the year, just organic growth in your strongest markets?","Donald M. James","Yes. We had volume growth across our footprint in virtually every market. And so, there is -- in housing, housing is recovering in most of our markets. And that's driving some of the improvement. But the improvement is coming from virtually all end markets, with the exception of non-highway publicly-funded infrastructure, which is down a little.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, can you speak to the bidding environment on some of these TIFIA projects? Is it possible to discuss what pricing is looking like, as you bid on TIFIA work?","Donald M. James","Well, we think it is an opportunity for improving pricing. The reason being, these are large projects. The aggregate cost as a percent of the total cost of the project is typically not very high. And as a result of that, reliability, quality, service becomes a bigger factor perhaps than the absolute selling price. And we believe that, that gives us a competitive advantage in the markets. We have booked the midtown tunnel in Norfolk, that's about 700,000 tons over the next 2 years. We booked some of the Grand Parkway in Houston. We booked some of the I-69 design build work in Corpus Christi. As I said, we booked the I-75\/I-575 Corridor work, that's about 1.5 million tons over the next 3 years. That will start in 2014. So we've been having very good success. We booked the Folsom Dam project in California that will start early next year. So about 500,000 tons. So we're having good success and we're doing it at good pricing.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just one last question, just to follow up on inventories that you're building in Mexico. And just wondering, was there any disruptions, whether as late in the quarter or early into the fourth quarter in your largest quarry there from the flooding that occurred in the region?","Donald M. James","No, we didn't have any disruption. The inventory build, Garik, is not at the quarry, it's in the yards along the Gulf Coast, as we are building that inventory in response to higher actual demand, and particularly, projected demand in 2014 [ph].","Operator","Your next question is from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Don, you certainly painted an optimistic picture of the demand environment. I was wondering, I know you didn't give formal '14 volume guidance. But could you give us maybe a little more of a qualitative assessment of how you're thinking about growth prospects on a volume basis next year?","Donald M. James","Well we are -- Ted, we are in the process of rolling up our 2014 outlook from the ground up, and we'll also compare that with the macro view from the top down. The macro, and I'll give you some third-party indication of what -- at least McGraw-Hill, through their Dodge Construction outlook for '14 will see, I'm not saying this will be our outlook, but certainly, we look at this and try to reconcile this with our own internal numbers. But McGraw-Hill sees single-family housing up 26% in dollars and 24% in units in 2014 compared to '13. They see multifamily up 11% in dollars and 9% in units. They see commercial building up 17%. They say institutional buildings will edge up 2%, turning the corner after 5 years of decline. And public works construction, including highways, they see down 5%. Their concern is federal focus on deficit reduction is going to make highway funding more difficult as we move into '14. We believe there's a lot of TIFIA work that will begin in '14 and more TIFIA projects that will be approved in the contracts let. But this is a pretty robust outlook, particularly on the private side. Again, we're not adopting these numbers yet. But in terms of trying to give you views on how we see '14, I think certainly, this will, directionally, we would agree with these numbers.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, we'd agree with those. And then, if you look at the September highway contract awards, I mean, you guys were up 39% in the month of September and on a trailing 6-month basis, you're up 12%. So that's -- I mean, I think we all recognize the challenge on highway federal level. But it seems like your set up in the next year is pretty solid, no?","Donald M. James","Well the -- the good thing is, after MAP-21 passed in, basically, September of 2012, it took the DOT 3 or 4 months to start awarding a higher level of highway contracts, most of those are now in the pipeline. So we're -- we have a pretty good, as you can tell from the contract awards, which is a clear example of the pipeline, which includes not only federally-funded projects but state and local projects as well, with essentially flat federal funding, the contract awards in dollars are up significantly, and that builds the pipeline. We're all working very hard, as you know, on trying to find a way to fund the next highway bill. We spend a lot of time and energy with freight [ph] associations and user groups, which are really a key, and the user groups would be companies like FedEx and UPS and Walmart and the American Trucking Association and AAA on the consumer side. I think there's a growing consensus that we are under investing in -- particularly in highways, but public infrastructure as well. As you know, there is a battle going on in Washington, not only between Republicans and Democrats, but between segments of the Republican Party. And so we are working hard to try to make the case for improved infrastructure funding, but at this point, we certainly don't have any crystal ball as to how that's going to turn out.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the second thing I was hoping to ask you is just on the Profit Enhancement Plan. Could you just -- I don't know if it's Don or Danny or Dan, but kind of maybe give a sense for where benefits came in for the third quarter, kind of where we are project to date and what's left in the gas tank and what kind of upside we may have to the $155 million?","Donald M. James","Yes, I'll let Danny and Dan address that.","Danny R. Shepherd","I think the way to look at this is, in 2011, we had an operating EBITDA of $346 million. And if you look at, at street estimates today, I think the average is right around $468 million. So I think it's fair to conclude that we've delivered on the Profit Enhancement Plan, because as we all know, volumes have not improved significantly since our starting point in 2011. It just give you a qualitative comment about the overall program. If you -- when we look at our G&A, our sourcing and our transportation categories, we believe that we've achieved greater than $100 million. And it's our intention to hold on to those savings, as we move forward into future periods, Ted. So we feel good about where we are, and we're going to make every effort to hold the greater than $100 million number that we think we've achieved.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Is there any way to quantify what the benefits were year-on-year in the third quarter? If it's easier to take that off-line, I'm happy to do that.","Danny R. Shepherd","Let's do that off-line. We had a good the third quarter. We believe that we -- we're right around $20 million in the third quarter of 2013. But we'll give you that comparison off-line, Ted.","Operator","The next question is from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Looking at the backlog up in private non-res, can you talk more specifically, Don, as to what kinds of projects you're seeing there? Also, with awards being up 10%, is that quick return than you would expect from -- like from an infrastructure-related backlog, for example. So that 10%, would that be something we could expect a little bit quicker?","Donald M. James","Trey, I want to be clear that -- that the data we have given are contract awards nationwide and in our states that are reported, not that we have booked all of that. So we believe we will get our fair share of those particularly given the fact that, as I indicated, 80% of them are in 5 of our key states. That being said, we continue to pursue those vigorously, because that's where the big growth is coming, we think. The kind of projects, some of them are industrial and energy-related projects on the Gulf Coast. But there are still a number of hotels and office buildings and retail that spread across our footprint. That's a pretty broad-based recovery. And I think we were holding our breath that the traditional relationship of private non-res recovery lagging res recovery by 6 to 9 months would hold true to this cycle. And it appears to be doing that. In fact, it appears to be even stronger in a lot of our markets than res has been. The construction cycle for private non-res varies greatly depending on the nature of the project. The bigger more complicated projects, obviously, take longer from contract award to material shipments, retail projects and hotels and office buildings typically can move a little faster, particularly they're not -- have government projects associated -- government restrictions and regulations associated with them. That being said, we would expect -- again I'm not trying to give guidance, but we would expect, based on macro data, that our shipments into private non-res will improve in '14 over '13. To give you a quantification of that, at this point, I'm not able to do.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I understand. Well, that's helpful. Looking into next year, the highway bill is set to expire in September. Obviously, like you said, Don, you don't have a crystal ball on how that would shake out, but neither do the state DOTs. And given your experience, what are your expectations for the DOT behavior going into the expiration of the current bill, as we look into next year?","Donald M. James","Well, I think I'd start with what the DOT behavior was coming out of the passage of MAP-21 in September 2012, and that is the DOTs geared up, got projects out for bid, and they'll move -- they got those projects approved through the Federal Highway Administration and they'll move forward. On the regular Federal Highway Program, typically as we have -- get closer to the expiration of the highway bill, the bid letting at the state DOT level on federal projects will begin to diminish. We are still 11 months away from the expiration of that bill. But so far, the contract awards, on a trailing 12-month basis or year-to-date, are still positive. Again, TIFIA is not part of the regular Federal Highway Program, per se, out of the -- and those projects are funded out of a different funding source. As you know, they have treasury, financing is available for those TIFIA projects, along with some private, typically some private money, and they tend to be revenue-generating projects. So I think, even if the regular federal paid highway program out of the highway trust fund begins to slow in terms of contract award, as we approach September 30, 2014, we are cautiously optimistic that the TIFIA projects, which at $30 billion to $50 billion spread over probably 2 or 3 years in terms of contract awards will help offset whatever weakness there maybe in contract awards in 2013, coming out of the regular state aid federal program out of the trust fund. But as I said, the TIFIA is far clearer that it will move forward in a significant way. And the funding source for the Federal Highway Trust Fund is yet to be resolved.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Last question. The recent transaction with Plum Creek, can you talk a bit about the rationale and then kind of, any update on use of funds? Would you be looking more at acquisitions like you did with the last deal, I believe, with Plum Creek, about a year or so ago? Or is there something else that you have in mind there?","Donald M. James","So the thing that makes that transaction makes sense for both Vulcan and Plum Creek is that Plum Creek, of course, is a REIT. They don\u2019t pay federal income tax and their cost of capital is lower than ours. And so a dollar that flows to Vulcan gets taxed at 35%, and a dollar that flows to Plum Creek doesn't get taxed at the REIT level and that makes a big difference in terms of the ultimate distribution of cash from the aggregates business to shareholders, either Plum Creek or Vulcan. As you see, we are paying off debt, as it becomes due. We paid off about $289 million. As we have opportunities that make sense, we want to continue to reduce debt. We also want to continue to look at strategic bolt-on aggregate opportunities. And there are a number out there that we are working on, as we speak, whether we are successful and can find value enhancing transactions, we'll see. But we think there are significant opportunities now. So we continue to look at both bolt-on aggregate opportunities, as well as debt reduction as potential uses for cash.","Operator","Your next question is from Jack Kasprzak with BB&T.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I just want to make sure I'm comparing apples with apples. The categories that you gave for McGraw-Hill, is the public category, the all-infrastructure category that would marry up with your -- what you term your infrastructure component of your business, which is highway and all other public?","Donald M. James","I believe that's correct. I'll defer to any of my colleagues. I think their commercial construction is private, and their public works construction is public, and here comes the answer. Say it again, Mark. Okay. Yes, highways and non-highway public works construction, and then commercial building is private.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Private. Yes. Okay. On the profit improvement, profit enhancement program and SG&A, I mean I know you're not giving guidance for '14, but done a good job keeping SG&A intact, and with that program, I mean looking forward to '14, I mean, should it be, more or less, flat? Would you expect a little bit of inflation? Just how should we think about that line, if you care to offer any comments?","Donald M. James","I think you're getting ahead of us, Jack.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And is there any tax impact from the gain, the $9 million gain, that you reported in the quarter?","Daniel F. Sansone","Jack, there's only a very modest impact. First, we fully tax affected the $9 million gain in our income statement. That gain, in terms of cash taxes, will not cost us anything because it's basically going against our net operating loss carryforwards.","Donald M. James","But from a GAAP purpose -- GAAP purpose...","Daniel F. Sansone","GAAP purpose, we taxed it at the full 39%, 40% marginal rate. And again, it just helps us in the utilization of NOLs.","Donald M. James","But you do the math to get to, what, an EPS at...","Daniel F. Sansone","About 4-ish, roughly $0.04.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","$0.04, right. And just so, long term, I mean we should -- normalized tax rate should still be in the high 20s or so, we think?","Daniel F. Sansone","Yes, when we get to normal operating levels, the key thing that moves our tax rate down from a statutory rate is depletion. And that's worth, at today's volume level, just over $20 million a year of tax benefit. As our volumes grow and our operating income rises, you'll still have that $20 million to $25 plus or minus million of tax benefit for depletion that will bring the effective tax rate down into the range you mentioned.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Last question is diesel prices in the quarter. Can you tell us what they were compared to last year?","Donald M. James","Yes, they were essentially flat with last year's third quarter.","Operator","Next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. Excellent aggregates volume growth in the quarter. Your outlook comments, I think, suggest maybe a slowing year-over-year growth in 4Q versus 3Q. I'm just wondering if you might be able to touch on the drivers of that? Was there any lumpiness in the third quarter shipments we should be aware of? Or just give us some insight as to how you're thinking about that in the fourth quarter?","Donald M. James","Our volume outlook for the fourth quarter, whether it sounds high or low, should be highly suspect, because weather can move that significantly. As we indicated, we had, compared to market demand, depressed shipments, particularly in the second quarter because of weather. We had some catch-up effect in the third quarter. Demand is good and growing. Though I -- we're not -- I would ask you not to focus much on the volume projection for the fourth quarter, simply because there are too many moving parts. But we did have lumpiness in the first 3 quarters of the year, almost totally driven by weather. Although with that weather overlay, there has been improvement in the market demand as we move through the year. So if we can keep that momentum, we're optimistic we could do perhaps better than what our year-to-date volume has been. But if we get unseasonably cold or wet weather or early cold or wet weather, people will shut down and move volume to '14. So we'll have to see how that plays out.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on inventory, you've been reducing them for a while now. I'm just wondering if you could comment on at what point you expect to be producing in line with demand?","Donald M. James","I think, going forward, we probably -- that will be our production schedule. As we look at, from the -- and that has to be done on a quarry-by-quarry basis. It's not some high level inventory management structure. Each quarry, each market has to look at projected future demand, timing of shipments, the sizes, the specifications, and has to build a production plan around the sales forecast. Certainly, as we see here today, if we see volume continue to move, to grow in 2014, our production levels should begin to approximate shipment levels, which certainly help our GAAP earnings.","Operator","Your next question is from Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So Don, a lot of my questions have been answered, but one sort of high level one. On the residential side, you obviously had a lot of nice things to say about what you guys are seeing in the residential markets. Certainly, some of the homeowners, a lot of investors have been concerned about a bit of a slowdown on the front end of what they're seeing in terms of orders and things like that. Can you square the circle a little bit and talk about what you may be hearing from your customers and what they're hearing from their customers?","Donald M. James","Well, a lot depends on what information you focus on. One of the factors that has supposedly slowed the sale of housing is the fact that prices have moved up sharply. And an explanation for prices have moved up sharply is the inventory of houses available for sale has fallen sharply. So it depends on whether you are selling an existing house or you're focusing on building a new house on a new lot. You're going to have a very different view about the current state of the housing market. We like the fact that inventory of houses available for sale is shrinking. We're seeing a significant amount of lot development going on, which is really one of the drivers for our product, much more than the actual construction of the house in markets other than sort of central and southern Florida, where there's a lot of aggregate in the construction of the house because of the building codes. I think we are cautiously optimistic that housing will continue its recovery based on demographics and affordability. Obviously, as interest rates are tending to move up and prices of housing is tending to move up, that will have an impact on demand presumably. But the McGraw-Hill data that I referenced earlier, they're saying single-family housing starts up 24% to 785. That's still a modest number compared to history and demographics and the normalized demand rate and construction rate for single-family housing. So while we recognize there are some headwinds to housing, in our markets at least, housing, at least in our -- most of our markets, the housing is -- remains very good.","Operator","The next question is from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Quick question. The government shut down, does that have any sort of impact on business? I mean, obviously, the volumes are very strong. But when you think about -- kind of having to think about this again, in a couple of months, I was just curious kind of what you -- how the state DOTs react to that?","Donald M. James","It is really hard for us to quantify the impact of the shutdown. If there has been an impact, it's sort of hard to see. But I think it's much more of a macro consumer confidence kind of issue that may have some impact. But it's really hard for us to trace it down to our business.","Danny R. Shepherd","And I think an important point is that the highway program, the Federal Highway Program and the trust fund, is insulated from the shutdown itself.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, that was my understanding that it, like, sometimes, environmental studies and so forth would be delayed, but it didn't sound like that was a big deal. And then as far as the debt paydowns, you guys have done a great job of that. Should we think about that as more as debt comes due? Or are there any specific debt-to-EBITDA targets you're looking at? Just kind of how to think about that? And also, within the context of the 2015 notes.","Donald M. James","Well, we certainly would anticipate paying off the 2015 notes as they become due, whether there's an opportunity to do anything before that remains to be seen. But we do want -- our -- we have a dual strategy here. One is to pay off debt, as we can find opportunities to do that. Also to increase EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA is the metric that needs improvement. And by increasing EBITDA as we reduce debt, we're certainly getting that back in line, where we want it to be.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi, filling in for Bob. Based on the commentary that you provided, it looks like public infrastructure spending should increase materially in 2014 in the states in which you serve, Do you think that growth will be fairly even over the year? Is there reason to believe that volumes will be front or back-end loaded next year?","Donald M. James","I don't have a good read on that. It's -- when some of these particularly these TIFIA projects start is a function of weather and the gearing up of the construction consortium in some cases, I would think the regular Federal Highway Program should be relatively stable across the course of the year. The driver for whether we're seeing TIFIA projects begin to show up in a significant way in the first half versus the second half is really wait and see, I think. We don't have a good read on the actual timing of when shipments will go on the TIFIA projects, even those that we already have booked, and in terms of the first half versus second half.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then someone -- a couple of people touched earlier on SAG, how impressive that's been year-to-date. And it looks like -- the Profit Enhancement Plan is scheduled to result in an incremental $25 million of the annual cost savings in 2014. Given the really impressive performance so far, do you think those savings are still available? Or has some of that been pulled forward with maybe this year and 2012?","Danny R. Shepherd","We still have opportunities. And we continue to make good progress, specifically in the transportation area. And we've had some really good successes on sourcing. So we believe that, that going forward in all 3 categories, G&A, SG&A, sourcing and transportation, we still have more that we can achieve.","Donald M. James","And I think as we see it today, we still believe there's an incremental 25 in 2014 that's not yet shown up on the bottom line in '13.","Danny R. Shepherd","Yes, we do. yes.","Operator","Next question is from Christopher Olin with Cleveland Research.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","I just had a couple of quick questions. Just going back to your operations in Mexico. Are you limited at this point, at any stage, by capacity when you start targeting these growth areas for 2014? I just wondered how much upside can come from that area?","Donald M. James","We are not capacity limited in any meaningful way. We can produce 12 million tons easily in that quarry. We have shipping capacity with our own vessels, as well as charter vessels. We also have the engineering work largely completed to expand the production capacity of that plant as we need to in a very cost efficient way. So that plant, which is our largest quarry, has a tremendous upside, as we look at continued growth along the Gulf Coast and in Florida and Texas, those are the principal markets, 3 markets, Texas, Florida and the Gulf Coast. And we have a plan to, as needed, to expand capacity very efficiently. So that is one of the really wonderful opportunities that Vulcan, going forward, is the shipments out of the quarry in Mexico.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. I guess I was also curious, you were talking about the demand strength across the Gulf of Mexico and building up inventories. I was just curious, within those demand drivers, has there been any impact from this port expansion or potentially people looking to accommodate the Panama Canal growth?","Donald M. James","To date, there's not been any shipments to any port expansion projects. But there are, as you know, there's sort of a race among several of the ports to be the first mover and try to be the port that will be able to take the first of the cape-sized container vessels. And we certainly are well positioned to benefit from any of those projects when they materialize. But to-date, I would say -- Danny, you correct me if I misstate this, I don't think we have shipped any of those projects, with the exception of a couple of years ago, we did a very large project in Norfolk at the Maersk terminal. And most of that material came out of our Havre de Grace quarry by barge. And that was plus or minus 1 million tons, I think. So the benefit of the work for us when these port expansions occur is the infrastructure to handle and store and transship the containers, which requires a very large storage and trans loading area, a huge amount of aggregate and a fair amount of concrete that would go into those projects. And so we're happy -- we'll be very happy to see them materialize, but we don't have any that are in any current state of bidding for materials.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Just -- apologize if you said it, but did you give a -- the outage cost for the cements line or the maintenance cost?","Donald M. James","About $3 million that we spent in the quarter on the scheduled outage.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. James for any closing remarks.","Donald M.

Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We're excited about the continuity and accelerating demand across our markets. We're excited about increasing pricing momentum, and pricing will continue to escalate throughout the year. We're also very pleased with our operating performance in the quarter.","In spite of the difficulties posed by bad weather, our local teams did a great job driving incremental revenue to the bottom line, balancing price, volume, sales and production mix, along with operating efficiencies and leverage. The first quarter is always choppy, but we still saw healthy growth and good operating execution.","Adjusted EBITDA was up 97%, total gross profit increased 128%, and same-store shipments increased 9%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 17%, with strong flow-through in aggregates gross profit, 68%, on incremental freight-adjusted revenue.

We are extremely well-positioned to achieve strong earnings growth in 2015 and beyond.","Slide 3 shows the quality of our first quarter execution. It shows how we continue to convert incremental revenues into earnings growth. Total revenues, excluding freight and delivery, increased 8%, while adjusted EBITDA almost doubled to $77 million. This was due to strong earnings growth in aggregates and earnings improvement in each of our non-aggregates segments, while we held SAG cost flat.","Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by a margin percentage or per-unit profit. We achieved these results despite the prolonged bad weather in many key markets.","Now let's look at our aggregate shipments map on Slide 4. I like the color of this slide. Momentum in shipments continue, with strong growth in key states such as California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois. Volume in Texas was up 22% or 15% on a same-store basis, and North Carolina was up 29% despite bad weather. Georgia volumes were down due to extremely bad weather, but Georgia construction activity continues to heat up and Georgia is on the road to a very good run.","Slide 5 shows the continuing volume growth across Vulcan's footprint. This momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity and supported by highway construction. It's occurring across all end-use segments. This is a result of the increasing number of large projects and growing highway demand as states ramp up their highway programs. Shipments grew 13% in total and 9% on a same-store basis in the first quarter, even with the impact of bad weather in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and in Texas.","The growth rate in aggregates volume on a trailing 12-month same-store basis has continued to accelerate, led by strong growth in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, while aggregate shipments in California and Georgia also had solid growth.","We continue to see healthy price growth, and pricing momentum is accelerating. We had a number of markets with high single-digit or double-digit price increases. For example, Miami was up almost $1.50 per ton; Tampa, over $2.40; Charlotte, over $1.70; Charleston, almost $2 per ton; and the Houston market was up $2; and overall, Texas prices were up over 10%.","We did have some headwinds on both geographic and product mix, with high volumes in lower-price states like Arizona and Illinois, and much larger shipments of base and finds on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Now this is not a bad thing as the volume and product splits helped our overall profitability.","We continue to see confidence in our customers' view of the market and their acceptance of price increases. There will be a lot more to come as we have secured April price increases in a number of key markets. For example, Texas, Georgia and Alabama all secured new increases of over $1 a ton in April. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices -- as new price increases are initiated and realized on both fixed plant work and new bid work. The pricing momentum is what you have come to expect from our industry and from Vulcan. What we are equally excited about is our ability to take top line freight-adjusted revenue growth straight to the bottom line.","In our last couple of calls, we've talked about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding margins and profits. On Slide 7, you can see our gross profit per ton increased 62%. So in the quarter, price was up $0.44 per ton, but gross profit was up $0.80.","Our sales and operating teams continue doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into higher levels of profitability. They are the best in the business at managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product.","This story of unit margin expansion isn't a new one for us. There's a trend here, not just a quarter story. As you can see on Slide 8, looking at this over time, we've continued to compound unit profitability faster than pricing. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 3% or $0.30 per ton. Over that same time period, our gross profit per ton has increased 19% or $0.63 per ton. This is a higher unit profit than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are still in the early stages of recovery. We are very pleased with this momentum.","Demand for our products continues to accelerate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 9 illustrates our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the quarter was 68%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014.","Aggregates gross profit grew by $31 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $46 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 52% as the gross margin on those revenues was impacted by acquisition accounting and seasonality.","Since quarterly figures could be distorted by weather or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was also 68%, adjusted for the same acquisition.","Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $148 million on incremental revenues of $229 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, gross profit flow-through is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.","With Slide 10, we can step back and look at the big picture, seeing the significant progress in the aggregates segment of our business. Before the recovery began, our annualized volumes troughed at 140 million tons for the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013. Since that time, we've added 26 million tons on an annualized basis. Nice, but still a far cry from normal demand. However, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by $216 million, with unit margins increasing 35%.","Again, our people were executing on the disciplines that grow gross profit. These results also foreshadow the earnings power of our aggregates business as we return to more normal levels of demand and as pricing fundamentals begin to improve.","Slide 11 shows our asphalt and concrete results for the quarter. Both of these businesses are improving on a same-store basis and as a result of transactions that we have made to improve our portfolio.","Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was approximately $9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4 million, driven by higher margins and earnings from existing operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 6% from the prior year. Unit profitability increased sharply.","First quarter concrete gross profit was $1 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested Florida and California concrete businesses, unit profitability improved dramatically. Gross profit increased $6 million.","Now I'll turn the call over to John for comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Tom. Capital allocation and capital efficiency, of course, remained critical areas of focus for our management team, and we gear our approach towards sustained value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to the allocation of capital across our business portfolio, let me remind you that in the first quarter we completed an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we exchanged our Southern California concrete operations for 13 asphalt operations primarily in Arizona. Vulcan will continue to supply aggregates to the swapped concrete operations, and you'll see a $5.9 million gain on this transaction included in this quarter's financials. We believe this transaction will prove valuable for both parties as each should be able to earn a higher return on the acquired assets than the prior owner.","Now let me turn from business development activities to the ongoing management of our capital structure and capital costs. As part of our February 25 Investor Day presentation, we outlined certain actions intended to refinance near-term maturities, lower our weighted average interest expense and extend the overall duration of our debt portfolio. Slide 12 summarizes these actions, which are now substantially complete.","On March 16, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes priced at 4.5%. This issue was very well-received, and the pricing reflects our now stronger and rapidly improving credit profile. Those funds, along with borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility, have been or will be used for the refinancing of $620 million of maturities otherwise due between now and 2018, as well as 2 smaller notes due in '21 and '22, for a total refinancing of approximately $640 million.","The left-hand slide of -- side of Slide 12 summarizes the relevant sources and uses of cash. And the right-hand side of the slide presents the relevant accounting charges, both the $21.7 million incurred in Q1 and the $46.9 million we project to incur for Q2.","Now let me turn briefly to Slide 13 to recap the impact of these recent transactions on our overall financial strength and flexibility. Let me first remind you that we have maintained our overall level of debt at approximately $2 billion. We're quite comfortable with that level of debt at this time given our expectations for 2015 EBITDA and our strengthening outlook. Though we have improved the structuring cost of our debt portfolio, as you see on the slide, we now effectively have no maturities due before 2018 and a total of approximately $500 million due before 2020. By the end of this year, when we refinance our 2015 notes at maturity, we will have added a modest amount of lower-cost floating rate debt to our mix, a move which makes sense for our business. In total, our weighted average interest rate will have dropped by approximately 120 basis points to 6.5%.","We expect to achieve credit metrics consistent with investment-grade benchmarks during the course of this year. And as our credit position continues to strengthen, we should have further opportunities to improve the overall structure and costs of our debt portfolio. We should also have the cash flows and the investment capacity needed to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders.","Now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. As noted earlier and as you see reflected in our Q1 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. As outlined in our February call, we continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve.","The Federal Highway Program receives much attention at the moment and deservedly so. Like other observers, we expect an extension of the current legislation, during which time leaders in Congress will seek agreement on funding sources for a new long-term bill. Although several states have delayed work due to uncertainty at the federal level, we currently do not anticipate a major disruption to our projected volumes for 2015. In fact, given our current backlogs and the patterns of new project starts in Vulcan-served states, we remain confident in growing our shipments to public transportation and infrastructure end uses.","Now the deteriorating state of the nation's transportation infrastructure and its very real cost to the average American family become more evident with each passing month. We believe that our congressional leaders understand this fact and we're hopeful that they will find a way to at least begin to address this pressing need.","But amidst all this frustration at the federal level, there is some encouraging news at the state and local level. And with that in mind, we did want to highlight on Slide 14 some of the positive trends we are seeing at the state level for infrastructure funding.","In general, state and local tax revenues have grown and mirrored the overall economic recovery. As state and local tax revenues approach all-time high levels, they provide stronger support for public infrastructure funding. Additionally, many states, and including several in Vulcan's service area, are tapping into other funding initiatives to bolster transportation and other infrastructure construction. At some basic level, this is a matter of responding to the demands of voters, servicing the requirements of growing population centers and, importantly, competing with other states.","Our primary goal today is simply to note this important trend as it is one reason we remain confident that aggregates demand associated with public highway and infrastructure spending will at least continue to grow at a slow but steady pace for the next several years.","To just briefly highlight a couple of very recent examples, I'll point to Georgia and Texas. Georgia very recently enacted new funding for its DOT, providing approximately $900 million in additional dollars annually, indexed to CPI and fuel economy standards, and a near doubling of the overall program. This legislation also eliminates or heavily constrains transfers of transportation revenues to other uses. This improved state-level funding complements the decision of several counties in Georgia to levy an additional 1% sales tax for local road funding. This is very good news for our Georgia business.","In Texas, the State House and Senate each recently passed bills to increase transportation infrastructure investments further. Should final legislation be enacted along these lines, annual funding would increase by a projected $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This commitment comes on the heels of Proposition 1, approved by voters in November, and which directed approximately $1.8 billion in new funds to road repairs and maintenance.","Again, these are just 2 examples of the type of action we're seeing across more and more of the states we serve. States recognize the federal program is necessary but not sufficient, and they are moving to tap new sustainable sources of revenue to protect those funds from being redirected to non-transportation usages and to invest in their future economic competitiveness.","I'd now like to review our full year outlook, which you see summarized on Slide 15. We have not, at this time, adjusted our full year EBITDA guidance from the range presented in February. As we've noted many times, overall first quarter results do not always provide a reliable read-through for the full year. That said, the underlying volume and pricing fundamentals during the first quarter were certainly encouraging, and they underscore not only the improved -- the improvements embedded in our 2015 outlook, but also our longer-term targets. If diesel prices remain around current levels, we currently would expect to finish 2015 toward the high end of our EBITDA guidance range.","In support of this of view and our overall sense of confidence and excitement, let me briefly walk through the assumptions underpinning our full year outlook. With respect to aggregate shipments, our 9% same-store growth in Q1 was on track with our full year outlook of up approximately 8%, despite weather deferring some shipments into later in the year. The gradual recovery in demand appears to continue across all end-use segments and across the vast majority of our geographies. We remain very excited about the continuing recovery in demand and its implications for our full year shipments.","Moving now to aggregates pricing. The momentum we currently see is consistent with or trending ahead of our 6% outlook for the full year. As Tom noted, April 1 price increases appear to have held up well, and we expect to see more price improvement throughout the year. We remain confident in the 6% target, and we expect many of our markets to see price growth well in excess of that rate. Pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets.","In terms of overall gross profit for the aggregates segment, our local teams continue to execute very well, converting well over 60% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues into gross profit. Unit margins continue to improve and to improve faster than pricing alone would indicate.","Diesel prices, as noted, have provided a tailwind and have helped offset certain costs inherent in meeting rising demand during often wet, cold operating conditions. We remain very confident in the full year gross profit outlook for the segment.","Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisitions, divestitures and swap activity. These businesses remain on track to meet or exceed their full year gross profit targets, although we should note that margins in these businesses can be more difficult to forecast.","And finally, SAG for the quarter remained flat to the prior year. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG expense to revenues as the recovery moves forward.","All in all, our business is enjoying strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing very well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. If history is any guide, we're likely to hit a quarterly bump or 2 somewhere on the multiyear road to normal construction activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain very exciting.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments.","James Thomas Hill","Thanks, John. We're very pleased with our first quarter performance. We're pleased with the accelerating volume growth, pricing momentum and strong margin expansion across the business. We're seeing growing construction activity in our markets. We have a lot of large projects already booked and more to come. Residential and non-residential construction in our markets is growing. And key states are also rising to the challenge of increasing funding for their highway programs. Meanwhile, we remain completely focused on the execution of the business. Price improvement, lowering costs, margin growth and capital discipline. Our teams all across Vulcan's footprint are doing that. We are very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us and look forward to sharing the good news with you in the future.","And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess I was hoping just to touch on pricing. I guess there's 2 elements to the question. One, we know reported was up about 4%. Can you talk about the headwinds and how we might calibrate around an underlying pricing number? And then the second question would be just kind of broader commentary, I know you mentioned that you're trending in line to above plan, which is good. But maybe if you could just talk about what you're seeing overall, and then if you could just compare and contrast kind of your results to kind of other data points throughout the quarter, that would be helpful just to get some context around Vulcan versus Martin and peers -- sorry, Vulcan versus peers.","James Thomas Hill","Okay. First of all, as John said, we're on track, if not ahead, I think of our 6% pricing guidance. First quarters are always, as we said, choppy, and so we saw good price increases that stuck in January. We've had very good price increases stick in April. But when you look at the first quarter, it's really not a problem from a mix or headwinds, but it's more -- it wasn't just base and finds, it's also when you have real wet, really cold weather, particularly along the East Coast, you're not shipping to what we call fixed plants, which is your asphalt and concrete customers, which is some of our highest pricing or not very much compared to other jobs. So that's also a mix impact. But if you look at the underlying momentum of what's going in pricing, we have -- it's really going very well and we have a lot of confidence in where we see ourselves at the end of the year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And can you talk about kind of the range of price increases that you put in April 1?","James Thomas Hill","Yes, it was -- in most places, it was around $1. Texas was higher. It was anywhere from $1 to $2. And that was the range.","John R. McPherson","Ted, a couple of additional points and color to add, just to build on Tom's comments. I guess the thing we headline most is that we feel very confident of the underlying momentum, and the underlying momentum is obviously more consistent with our annual guidance than it would be the number you would see in just the first quarter. But a few other comments. I think -- and just because you asked, Ted, in comparison to other numbers, and let's just take Martin's number from last week, certainly, that's a very good headline number and we take it as another indication of the improving fundamentals in many of the markets that we serve. It's very hard for us as outsiders to make a true apples-to-apples comparison when you take into account freight impacts and geographic and product mix impacts, the impacts of the TXI acquisition and those kind of things. But that said, I think if we step back, our best guess would be that we're seeing many of the very same things. As Tom noted, our pricing in Texas for the quarter was up 10-plus percent. Our overall pricing outlook for the year, frankly, is roughly in line with Martin's new guidance, even though we don't measure pricing exactly the same way. Our flow-throughs, I think, were very consistent despite the difference in headline price numbers. So when you step back from all that, I would guess or expect that we see very much the same thing. And we, just to reiterate, again, confidence in the full year price outlook we've put out there, confidence in the trends, confidence in the ability to convert incremental shipments and pricing into gross profit and confidence in the longer-term fundamentals beyond just one quarter. What we're seeing in terms of volumes, what we're seeing in terms of price, what we're seeing in terms of margin expansion, all still on trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just to circle back around to one question real quick and ask it in a little bit different way. Did you -- did I miss it? Or can you quantify how much you think you lost from mix on that price increase number? Or is it just more of a general kind of concept?","James Thomas Hill","I think it's just really hard to do in the first quarter because of what I talk about, the mix effect of fixed plant versus just bid work, and that's really hard to pull out as opposed just base and finds. It's a big piece of where the clean stone goes and how much of it is in there.","John R. McPherson","And one thing we -- to Tom's point, I mean, it's from a one -- from a first quarter-to-first quarter can be very difficult to make accurate comparisons. The momentum is obviously stronger than the 4%, as you can tell by our full year outlook. I'd also just note that despite the strong reported numbers in terms of shipment growth, we still had, by our estimate, something on the order of 400,000 tons in each of Texas, Georgia and Virginia deferred from Q1 and delayed a quarter due to weather. And a lot of that, as Tom mentioned in his pricing comments, was fixed plant business. So again, that's not abnormal for a first quarter. But given the wet days we had in those markets and given its impact and available construction days, not an insignificant impact in the quarter, both on volumes and, by extension, on pricing.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And sticking with pricing for one more, any plans for a second round this year, either in the summer or the fall, of increases?","James Thomas Hill","Yes, you'll see a number of price increases go into effect midyear. You'll see some in October. And then as we bid work throughout the year, we will raise prices on the bid work. And as all work works off, it will impact pricing.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Great. Great. And then I want to ask kind of a general question. I think if the word for the day on the last earnings report was momentum, the word for the day this time is probably accelerating. And that's -- we would term that too in terms of price increases accelerating, volume growth accelerating. But I mean, when you think about the momentum and the business, and I know you've talked about this, but if you think about the momentum in the business, you think about the acceleration of the rate of growth here, what's that being driven by? Is that just sort of a -- you have mentioned large projects, but is it a little bit of everything everywhere? Or is there some particular end market or job type that you're seeing a lot of?","James Thomas Hill","It's, as you said it best, it's a little bit of everything everywhere. All market segments are increasing. Now the private is moving faster than the public, although we've got very good highway jobs, big jobs in our footprint that we secured and also some very big jobs along the Gulf Coast. But it is absolutely everything and all -- it's everywhere and everything. I think large projects are just a piece of it, a very nice piece, but just a piece of it.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Good. And, John, a final question just to nit. Do you have an outlook for interest expense for the year given some of the bond work that you've done?","John R. McPherson","Yes, I think you can subtract the charges from interest expense labeled in the release. It's $221 billion roughly,$218 billion. And then you've got about a $69 million of charges that you could subtract out from that, that would give you this year's interest expense. But just to keep it simple, think about a 6.5% weighted average interest rate on a $2 billion debt portfolio. And so if you think about it for next year, you're looking at about $130 million, if you just take out the, I call it the messiness of this year. And obviously, we'll give guidance around that again as we get to next year. But think about $130 million as a run rate on the $2 billion debt portfolio as it currently stands.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","On your 8% organic guidance, I think you may have touched on this a little bit earlier, give as much detail of what you're expecting from the various end-user markets to make up that 8%.","James Thomas Hill","Yes, if you look at the -- if you look at highway, we'd say low single digit. Infrastructure would be low single digit. Residential would be mid- to high double digit, and non-res would be probably mid-double digit.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And within non-res, a distinction there between manufacturing versus office and things like that, any view there?","James Thomas Hill","Well, I think it's 2 things. It's your traditional non-res, which is office buildings, malls, buildings. It's also -- we've seen big growth in very large projects. As I mentioned earlier, the energy projects along the coast, we'll probably ship almost 3 million tons to those projects this year. And they're special to us because of our unique position in Mexico and our ability to supply those jobs via ships in the quantity and in the time that they need to be supplied. So -- and so that's not a 1-year play. We'll see that much volume or more in 2016. Those are also very, very profitable jobs again because of the advantage we have with blue water transportation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","The first, with oil prices remaining lower than last year, what are you seeing in the asphalt business? Are prices declining there? Or are you seeing any volume pickup from the lower prices? Could you help us understand a little bit of those dynamics?","James Thomas Hill","We haven't seen any price decline at this point. There's other drivers on asphalt than just oil. It's a big one. But we have not seen pricing decline in asphalt. Always, lower liquid prices help, but that's -- that changes across our footprint. Remember, we're shipping asphalt -- we're making asphalt everywhere from Texas, all the way up through Northern California. So there's -- while overall, liquid has gone down, we've got some markets where it's not going down nearly as much as it has in others. Overall, though, I think our, at least in the first quarter, our profitability was up. We had good efficiencies in asphalt. We had good pricing. We had some headwinds due to weather, where it was cold. But so far, our -- we're pleased with our performance in the asphalt product line.","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then switching gears, could you just update us on the M&A pipeline? Is there any shift in the regions you're focused on, given the near-term dynamics? Or are you -- or is it pretty much as it was?","James Thomas Hill","I don't think there's any big shift for the reasons we're interested in. There is -- there are some attractive things out there that we work on. We are also very pleased with the integration we've seen of what we picked up in 2014. Those performed well and on plan, even in spite of some seasonality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First off, you guys mentioned, obviously, weather kind of played a role in some of your markets in 1Q. But that should be -- that volume should be pushed later into the year. How quickly can you guys recapture that volume? And can you kind of talk about what kind of demand trends you're starting to see there through April and May?","James Thomas Hill","Well, let me talk about the first quarter. What we saw there was when it was dry, our shipments were very, very good across our footprint. So there is a lot of pent-up demand. It will, as the weather falls, it will come back to us. It wasn't just -- in the first quarter, it wasn't just cold wet weather, it was prolonged wet weather. And so the times we did have dry weather, everybody showed up and it was there. So we expect it to return sharply.","John R. McPherson","Trey, I guess the best answer, because let's not comment on specific quarters in terms of second or third, but we still have plenty of time in the year to recover that demand. And the way we think about it, our customers still have plenty of the time in the year to get that work done.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just geographically, are you guys seeing any shifts or notable trends geographically since the weather has started to cooperate?","James Thomas Hill","I think what you're seeing is -- Texas is doing very well, but I think what you're seeing is the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states really starting to pick up momentum. This will be a much better year in those markets than 2014 as demand continues to accelerate.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And as we think about mix in light of that comment, is there any mix that we should be aware of, mix change that we should be aware of given the your geographic kind of outlook?","James Thomas Hill","When it comes to mix, as the recovery returns, as we always say this, we'll see a more -- a bigger mix of base and finds, which is a very good thing for us, because overall, it adds to our profitability. But as far as our guidance on price, in spite of mix, we're confident in it. And I would also say that the return of new construction with the demand for base and finds is a very good thing for us.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","All right. My last one is, John, you mentioned earlier, and this is just kind of a point of clarity, that you don't -- you guys don't measure pricing exactly the same way as Martin Marietta, and I know it has to do with the way you guys look at freight. But can you clarify, just so everybody is on the same page here, what you meant by that comment, please?","John R. McPherson","Sure. The way we report pricing is freight-adjusted. And so we take out the -- I think it was net of freight. So instead of reporting gross pricing to the customer, including freight charges that are effectively a pass-through, we report net pricing net of freight expenses to the customer, again, because we think, for us, that's a more accurate depiction of the underlying economics and it's the number we focus on internally as we manage our business. So if rail rates to our customers go up or if we have a broader mix of business that goes by rail or other long-haul transportation, it's not going to affect the net pricing number we report.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask you specifically about any weakness that you might be seeing on the energy markets or how you're thinking about that as the year progresses.","James Thomas Hill","I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you hear me better now? No...","John R. McPherson","Any weakness in the energy markets or do we see that...","James Thomas Hill","No.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","James Thomas Hill","We -- yes. I guess to answer your question, we don't ship much to the drilling -- to the energy market. When I say the energy markets, I'm talking about the oil patch, where they're drilling, where it's affected by the price of the barrel. So we wouldn't see it. We ship very little to that market. Now when you talk about energy when it's about the jobs along the Gulf Coast, which is the LNG jobs, refinery expansions, we continue to see that go very well. As I mentioned earlier, we'll ship over -- probably around 3 million tons of that for those jobs this year, at least that much next year, and we continue to see a number of those projects be bid and go through construction planning.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So seeing that consistent, it sounds like?","James Thomas Hill","Yes.","Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Cool. And yes, I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about priorities for uses of cash in light of the options that you might have with your M&A choices out there looking similarly strong, just your priorities, if you could remind us of those.","John R. McPherson","Just to give the quick walk through, and I'll start. Tom can comment. First, we're obviously going to continue to make the required capital reinvestments back in our franchise. And those protect the long-term health and value of our asset base, and they actually drive many of the productivity benefits you see in our quarterly results quarter-after-quarter. So that, for this year, that $250 million of CapEx, that's obviously a priority. We'll continue to do that in a very, very efficient way. But we're not going to shortchange our core asset base. It's too valuable. Secondly, as we've noted, we're going to maintain our financial strength throughout the cycle. Given the actions we've taken, that shouldn't be a significant use of cash in the foreseeable future. But I would call it out as something we're committed to maintain. Next, on dividends, this is obviously a board-level decision. But it's our expectation that our dividends would continue to grow with earnings, and we think earnings could grow quite quickly during the recovery part of the cycle. But again, that's a board decision that they will take in due course. Then we turn to largely bolt-on M&A, really of the kind you've seen us do in the last 2, 3 years. We think that's a very good use of capital, tends to have very good returns, both on a standalone basis and in terms of its impact on the rest of our business. And so as we find the right assets at the right price, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities. We work through all that and we expect that over time, we will still have some excess cash after all of those other uses. And as stated, we will look to return some portion of that cash in the recovery cycle, if not most of that cash, to investors and through a mix of dividend and share repurchase, but I'd say, primarily, opportunistic share repurchase will be our current thinking.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","First, just to touch back on base and finds that you discussed earlier in the call, could you clarify where you are in terms of working down the inventory of base and finds inventory? And what regions require greater work in terms of working down these inventories versus others?","James Thomas Hill","Good question. First of all, I'd say that I think our operating folks and our sales folks did a really good job in the downturn of managing inventory, so we're starting from a pretty good place. As we do have some, I wouldn't call it a problem, by any means, but it sure does make your operations run smoother when you have large sales of finds and base. It just balances it out, makes the -- it lowers your -- actually lowers your cost and increase -- because it just increases your efficiencies in the operations. So not a problem with inventories, but it sure will be helpful as the cycle goes along to see those base-and-find jobs come through and go to the bottom line.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Are there any regional differences with the base and finds inventory versus any other region?","James Thomas Hill","No, I don't think I see any big regional -- not that I can think of off the top of my head. I think we're -- like I said, we did a -- we took a lot of pain in the downturn to make sure we didn't have a problem with that, and I think, again, I think our operating people did a really good job of biting the bullet, so to speak, when times were tough to make sure we weren't left with a problem.","John R. McPherson","And, Kathryn, well, part of Tom was referring to, and I think you understand this, is that we resisted the temptation. And this is the management team before us deserves credit for this, but we resisted the temptation to build inventory, if you will, to produce the profits as opposed to customer demand during the downturn. And so we've come into this in pretty good shape from an inventory point of view. And I think you see that in our flow-throughs and our incrementals. You see that in our results. So this is more about maintaining balance as we serve rising demand and as production ramps up than it is having any kind of problem.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. Great. This is more a question related to acquisitions. Could you clarify the acquisition contribution in the quarter revenue, volumes, operating earnings? And maybe clarify a little bit more the delta between acquisition and incremental margins versus same-store sale metrics?","James Thomas Hill","First of all, I think, the -- for the acquisitions, and this is not counting the divestitures of the concrete, the acquisitions EBITDA was around $5 million. And I would tell you that that's -- we're pleased with that based on the seasonality we saw and we still had the headwinds of some purchase accounting in those numbers, which hopefully we've worked through most of that. Our guidance on those -- or our outlook on those operations for the full year remains in plan. And I think we're pleased with the integration.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Great. And on the -- I guess you specifically cited Georgia weather impact. Where in Georgia were you seeing a greater relative impact? And in general, when you talk about weather, which was cited several times in the release, was it later in the quarter? Was it more a product of precipitation? So first, specifically to Georgia, but then more broadly speaking in terms of that weather effect in the quarter.","James Thomas Hill","I guess Georgia was all over, but obviously, the biggest market is Atlanta. And it wasn't a matter of how many inches of rain or snow we had, it was days lost due to wet weather. It was how prolonged it was versus the prior year. So it just shut us down longer than before. But I think we had, in Georgia, I think we had, for example, we had 10 more wet-weather days than we did in the prior year.","John R. McPherson","And, Kathryn, that comes out specifically, as Tom mentioned again, in things like our shipments to our key asphalt customers, key fixed plan asphalt customers in the quarter, which are, I'm going to call it, were 400,000-plus tons, if I recall, below plan for the quarter. And that's kind of booked jobs, booked business, so you feel confident calling it out as something that -- our customers weren't able to do the work to get the crews out and so we deferred our shipment to them. Again, it's a lot of asphalt -- yes, a lot of asphalt business and some fixed plan concrete business, but primarily asphalt businesses around Atlanta.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik Simha Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","A follow-up question on the acquired assets. Just as you think out over the next 3 quarters of the year, incremental margins in the first quarter were soft for the reasons that you cited, purchase price accounting, seasonality, but is there anything within those assets that are fundamentally different from your, I guess, legacy assets that would depress or impact incremental margins moving forward?","James Thomas Hill","No, I don't see anything different in those assets. They always take a little time to integrate and, again, we had some seasonality, but I see no reason that they won't perform fairly quickly, or at least over time, as our current assets do.","Garik Simha Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just looking at your volumes, very strong in the quarter. I get why you're hesitant at this point, early stage of the year, to raise your volume guidance. But can you just talk maybe about some of the, if any, risks that you would see to end-market demand, specifically which of the major end markets, if any, are you, I guess, less bullish on? Because the tone of the call, with the theme of \"acceleration,\" things appear to be perking up really nicely across your footprint. Is there any one area or, if any, that is cause for concern at all?","James Thomas Hill","Well, obviously, I can't -- we can't predict worldwide events that may some catastrophic impact, but just assuming that all of that is neutral, I don't see any big risk. We've obviously got to go get a federal highway extension and a federal highway bill. I think there's very low risk that we -- that funding -- federal funding for highways is going to run out or that Congress will let it slip, in fact, a very low risk with that. But we still have to go get a long-term bill. While states, we saw, as John mentioned, a number of states are upping their funding and we actually see momentum with that, we're very pleased with it, states get nervous when there's not a long-term bill out there and they will start holding multiyear large jobs when they're insecure about the federal government's paying the highway bills.","John R. McPherson","The only other one that I think we've talked about internally that jumps out, I'm just kind of thinking this was a good question, is Texas longer-term, with the decline in oil prices and we, of course, monitor it like anybody else. We haven't seen any impact yet, I think it's fair to say, particularly in our business, and you can see that in our Texas shipments this quarter despite a wet quarter in Texas. But that's one that obviously we, like other people, will continue to monitor just to see if that creates any dislocations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if we can just talk about what proportion of your markets do you expect to enter your price increase on April 1, and then maybe share a similar data point for July 1 or how were you thinking about mid-year.","James Thomas Hill","Price increases, and we say this all the time and as we're not hiding behind it, but it's really true, pricing happens at different times in different markets, when I say that, even submarkets. So the pricing in -- for concrete rock versus asphalt rock in a market may be on different timing depending on the personality of the market. As far as April price increases, we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had price increases in Atlanta that went into effect in April. We had very large price increases in Texas that went into effect April 1. They were from $1 to $2, depending on where you were in Texas. And then we saw some price increases that went into effect in April in Florida. We'll see some more in different market segments in Florida mid-year. And as the year goes along, and as I said earlier, when we bid work, we'll continue to build price increases in that bid work on individual jobs, coupled with as you work off old backlog work, it will also give some momentum to price increases.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the asphalt and concrete businesses, you folks have been pretty vocal with earning a fair return on your aggregates reserve and needing to get there. Can you just talk about how to get there in asphalt against concrete? Are you looking for outsized pricing to get there this year? Or is that a 2016 event? Can you paint the path for us for those assets?","James Thomas Hill","Yes, if you -- let's take concrete first. And our pricing in concrete for the quarter on a same-store basis was up almost $7, so we're seeing good momentum in concrete with pricing. And as I talked about earlier, some momentum in not just the aggregates business, but across the entire construction materials segment, so as you see that momentum in concrete, cement, asphalt, and it makes it just that much easier for pricing to flow through with aggregates. So -- and we saw price increases across our footprint on a same-store basis on our concrete product line. When it comes to asphalt with -- you probably won't see a lot of big price increases in asphalt with the impact of liquid. But the profitability in asphalt overall was up sharply, probably over 30% on a unit basis in asphalt. So again, you're seeing the momentum when it comes to profitability and the downstream products, which sets the table for continued price increases on aggregates.","John R. McPherson","And, Jerry, if you step back and think about our -- just our portfolio longer-term, building on Tom's remarks, our asphalt business has earned quite good returns on capital through the cycle. Material margins period-to-period can be volatile, but through a cycle, earn pretty good returns. In concrete, what we have left, the concrete businesses we continue to own, are doing well and earn good returns for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to ask another question about your incremental gross margins on the aggregates line. The factors that impacted you in Q1, most of those were weather-related. I guess some were not. Have any of those negative factors carried into Q2?","James Thomas Hill","I think -- I'm sure -- I'm not sure I understood your question. Would you repeat it?","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes, I mean, the incremental gross margins in aggregates were lower than you saw last year. And my question is, the factors that caused that to happen, did any of those carry into Q2?","John R. McPherson","I think if you look at it on a same-store basis, the incremental gross margins continue to improve. So I think the key for you is probably look at it on a same-store basis to get an accurate read on the numbers. But if anything, we would expect our unit margins at our aggregates segment to continue to expand.","James Thomas Hill","I also think -- you've got to remember, we've got a first quarter in there, which is, as we say, is always choppy. If you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, it's improving.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. The price increases in Texas, you noted were a little bit higher than other places, but you also said you're watching Texas for potential slowdowns. So just curious why you're seeing stronger pricing trends there.","James Thomas Hill","The demand in the market is more mature than other markets. It's just further in the cycle. It's actually foreshadowing what will happen across the rest of our markets as demand continues to recover. You've got to remember Texas never had the big fall that some of our other markets had, and then they were early in the recovery. They were bolstered with all the big energy plays. So the demand in Texas and where we are in the cycle is more mature than we are in other markets. So pricing should be ahead there.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, we're 1\/3 of the way into the year, and I'm curious on the private construction side, are you seeing demand that's in line with your initial expectations for the year? Or is it slightly better?","James Thomas Hill","No, we're seeing it in line. We're actually -- we're seeing very good momentum in the private construction segment of the market.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Collin Andrew Verron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Collin filling in for Bob. I just have a quick question on the public side. So in your presentation, you noted that the states have really been increasing their funding levels. But you have seen some projects being delayed. Can you discuss what states you've seen that in? And where you'd expect this -- expect to see this as uncertainty continues?","James Thomas Hill","The projects -- the places we've seen projects delay because of the lack of a long-term bill are really in Arkansas and Tennessee and just really some large projects that they have. They haven't gone away. They just said we're not going to commit to them and put them out for bid until we have more secure long-term federal funding.","Operator","And at this time, I'll now turn the call over to Tom Hill for closing remarks.","James Thomas Hill","Well, again, we were pleased with our first quarter, and we look forward to the coming quarters and sharing our good news with you. Thank you so much for your interest in Vulcan Materials, and we look forward to talking to you over the coming months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Sherlon, and I will be the conference call coordinator today. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren please begin.","Mark Warren","Good morning everyone and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO, and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this Webcast and on our Web site supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions.","With that said please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of Federal, State and Local funding for infrastructure, the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry, and other risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our Earnings Release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.","In addition to this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.","Our business continues to perform very well, even with a slower rate of shipment growth in the second quarter, our margins continued to improve considerably. We remain on track, consistent with our guidance to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. The fundamentals of the business continued to strengthen.","I'll mention three areas in particular. One, the factors underpinning the continued gradual recovery and demand remains intact, notably, with higher levels of public funding, supporting further growth in 2017 and beyond. Two, our internal execution remains very solid. We're meeting our customers rising needs and we're balancing volumes, pricing and product mix. Our teams are continuing to do an outstanding job converting incremental revenue into profits. And three, the core profitability of the business continues to improve, trading 12-month gross profit per ton in our aggregate segment increased by 31% to $4.77 per ton and adjusted EBIT on a trailing 12-month basis increased 62% to $682 million. So, the foundation for multi-year growth continues to strengthen in demand outlook, in execution and in our core profitability.","Now, regarding second quarter shipments. I want to reiterate a point made in last quarters earnings call. A single quarter's result doesn't always give a good picture of the underlying volume trends in the business. Now obviously, the 3% growth rate for aggregates shipments in the quarter contrast sharply with the first quarter rate of 17%. Prolonged bad weather in certain markets, large project timing, sales mix and other factors can cause our business results to vary substantially week-to-week and month-to-month. Certainly, we've seen that variability over the last two quarters but the underlying drivers and the basic trends remain unchanged.","For example, if we pull back to look at just the first half of the year as opposed to looking at two quarters individually, we see that our core aggregates business has posted shipment growth of 9% over the first half of 2016 and pricing growth of 8%. Those results are in line with recent trends and with our plans for the year. I'll comment in more detail on individual geographies during Q&A. But taken as a whole, the bottom line is that we still see our core demand drivers and longer term project pipelines strengthening across our footprint. In fact, we anticipate sustained growth in all end use segments, even though we've yet to see much benefit in terms of shipments from rising public funding.","We'll see continued recovery in private construction. Public funding will start to pick up in an important way by 2017 and beyond, as states commit to large long-term projects on the strength of the FAST Act and we see a healthy number of large projects that we will serve in the queue for 2017 and 2018.","Now moving back to the second quarter. Just as a number of factors combined to boost the rate of shipment growth in the first quarter, several factors combined to affect shipments in the second quarter. We saw extremely wet weather in several key markets. At the same time, certain markets experienced a lull in large project starts both public and private. This was despite a healthy pipeline of projects and in retrospect, it's likely that some work was pulled forward into the first quarter.","As you know, we typically see a fairly high degree of variance in shipment patterns across our individual markets, particularly month-to-month, but I think it's fair to say that the second quarter brought with it a higher than normal degree of variance. The second quarter could be seen as a story of the haves and the have-nots. Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois combined saw aggregate shipments decline by 10% versus the prior year, while the remainder of our states combined grew shipments by 14%. We continue to see strong shipment growth across most of the Southeast where the recovery has really begun to take hold over recent quarters and certain of these states for example, Georgia have put in place higher levels of public funding that will support higher materials demand in 2017 and beyond, even though we haven't seen much of that impact yet.","For California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, we've seen a mix of weather and large project timing impacting year-over-year shipment rates. All of those specifics vary by State and market. I'd note that California, Texas and Virginia each have healthy longer term growth prospects and what we're experiencing now is more transitional or timing related issues.","In contrast, we don't currently see a similar path to longer term demand growth in Illinois. Due to that states well known fiscal challenges, although our team there has done a nice job of growing its profits and cash flows. I mentioned the significant fluctuations in shipment rates month-to-month throughout the quarter.","As you saw in our press release during May, this resulted in daily shipments declining by about 5% from the prior year. On the other hand daily shipments rates in April and June were up approximately 8% and 6% respectively. These kind of fluctuations are not uncommon. All the more reason to avoid extrapolating from short-term volume trends in a business such as ours. Even though these swings in shipments activity at the local level can create some operational challenges, our teams have done a superb job adapting to changing market conditions and consistently meeting our customers' needs. So ultimately I don't find the recent spikes and lulls in demand to be a great concern. It's just the nature of the business.","Regarding our local teams ability to adapt to changing market conditions, I'm pleased with the way our people are delivering continued profitability gains despite modest overall shipment growth and shifting delivery in production schedules.","Regarding pricing; our average price freight adjusted selling prices for aggregates in the quarter were up 7% over the prior year, despite some headwinds from geographic and product mix. Meanwhile, our unit costs of sales were flat and unit cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86 or 15% from last year's quarter. Our incremental flow through rate exceeded 80% for the quarter and 75% on a trailing 12-month basis. We also enjoyed healthy margin expansion in our asphalt and our concrete segments, despite low rates of volume growth.","On a total company basis and excluding the impact of freight and delivery revenues, gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 500 basis points over last year's second quarter. Those are strong results and they aren't one offs. They represent a next step on a long-term path of continuous compounding improvement. We provided additional information regarding our longer term profit improvements and our release and the supplemental slides. So I won't repeat that here.","Other than to highlight that on a trailing 12-month basis, our gross profit per ton and our core aggregates segment has increased by 87% or $2.22 per ton since the recovery began in 2013.","Now, before handing it off to John, I'd like to share a few thoughts regarding our expected results for the balance of the year. As I've already noted we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We finished the first quarter trending towards the higher end of that range although we gave some of that back during the second quarter. We continue to expect full year aggregate shipments to exceed 190 million tons, but our ultimate results will depend in large part on three things, just as was the case in the second half of 2015.","One, on the ability of our customers to catch up on weather delayed work. Two, on the start and completion timing of larger projects, and three, on the number of shipping days allowed by weather conditions particularly in the fourth quarter.","The demand fundamentals are there and strengthening. The pricing and unit profitability is there. It's on track and it's growing, so then it's really a matter of timing, how we finish will largely depend on how much of the work that is clearly there can be completed by the end of the year before we move into 2017 where demand will only grow.","Let me sum it up. We saw a strong first half with 9% shipment growth and 8% pricing growth in our core aggregate segmented. Longer term demand fundamentals are in place, pointing towards a strong scenario developing for 2017. In the near-term, we've seen rapid growth across the Southeast but a lull in large project activity in parts of California, Texas and Illinois. We are benefiting from excellent continued improvements to our core profitability, even during a quarter with slower volume growth. The pricing climate remains positive and as was the case last year, we need to make up for some weather delayed volumes in the second half. I'll come back in a moment with some final remarks, but for now let me hand it off to John for a few brief comments regarding our overall cost controls, our balance sheet strength and our capital allocation priorities. John?","John McPherson","Thanks, Tom.","I'd like to start with one more complement to our local teams and their operational performance and cost control discipline throughout the early stage of the cycle. Although we have had and will likely continue to have ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter, the overall cost trend has been impressive. For example, in our core aggregates segment, our unit cost of sales per ton as measured on a trailing 12-month basis, has declined consistently with each reporting period since the recovery began in the second half of 2013.","So over a three year period, when our average selling price for a ton of aggregates increased by about $1.64, again measured on a trailing 12-month basis, our average unit cost of sales declined by about $0.57. Lower diesel prices have aided these results, but strong daily operating disciplines, effective coordination among local production and sales teams and a commitment to continuous improvement have also played a central role.","We often talk about how seemingly small improvements compound and add up to a sizeable impact on our business and in this case, our ongoing local operating disciplines have contributed meaningfully to the strong conversion of incremental revenue and to incremental profit that we've reported throughout the recovery so far.","Unfortunately, we cannot make entirely similar observations regarding our SAG costs, despite the fact that we've held administrative headcount basically flat since the recovery began. As you've seen, second quarter SAG was $13.5 million higher than the prior year. A bit more than half of this increase results from the amount and timing of accruals for performance based incentives and deferred compensation plans. Approximately another quarter of the rise in second quarter SAG resulted from higher salaries and relocation expenses, primarily related to investments in our sales and business development talent and the strategic rotation of sales leadership across geographies.","We will continue to make strategic investments in our sales talent and capabilities. Those costs and higher incentive accruals will cause run rate SAG costs to be elevated in the near-term, with our full year projection now at $310 million.","Although we are not fully satisfied with our recent results and trend, we will continue to leverage SAG to sales throughout the recovery and beyond. The investments we're making are sound and ultimately support a higher volume growth at higher margins.","I'll touch now briefly on our balance sheet strength as the facts have continued to improve but the fundamental story remains unchanged. Our stated goal as you know is to maintain an investment grade credit position throughout the cycle. We have achieved such a position. And of course, our cash flow profile continues to improve. In short, we have the financial strength and flexibility needed to pursue a balanced mix of capital reinvestment, growth investments including M&A, and return of capital to shareholders.","Finally, I'll note that our weighted average cost of capital has declined significantly since the recovery began, in part due to our improving financial performance and credit position and in part due to our focus on aggregates and the divestiture of our cement and concrete assets from our portfolio.","Turning now to capital allocation. Our summary message is that our recent and planned activities remain consistent with the priorities you've heard us articulate several times. We do remain active in terms of business development and the pursuit of acquisition opportunities that fit us strategically. And I think it is fair to say that we are aggressive but disciplined. We're looking at a number of opportunities at various stages of development, and again, we have the financial capacity to grow without overly straining our credit position. And we have continued to return additional capital to shareholders via share repurchases. As you know, we have not committed to a specific repurchase target. Instead we will remain opportunistic and seek to balance a return of capital and reinvestment over time.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom. ","Tom Hill","Thanks, John.","Before taking your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my confidence in our company. I've been with this company for over 26 years and I believe our business is stronger and more resilient than it's ever been. We're in the midst of a sustained multi-year recovery. We're enjoying an ongoing recovery in private construction and on top of that, we are just beginning to see a new wave of increased public spending. We'll highlight these demand trends for 2017 and beyond during our aggregates date event on September 29.","We have an amazing aggregates focused asset base that positions us extremely well to serve the demand growth that is coming. Our core profitability and cash flows are very strong and just keep improving. Our balance sheet is strong. Our financial condition gives us a lot of flexibility to do smart M&A, to reinvest in our operations and to return capital to our shareholders. And our culture at this company is great. Our people are helping each other get better every day and they are upbeat and they are on their game. Our position is frankly an enviable one, especially when viewed against the back drop of uncertain times and I really like our position looking out over the next several years.","At some point, our country must address the major infrastructure challenges that we still face as a nation. Look, it's good to have a five-year federal highway bill, but we still have a degraded highway system. Major U.S. infrastructure investment must and will occur eventually, whether as a matter of smart proactive economic policy, reactive fiscal stimulus, dire necessity, or some combination of these. We don't assume such a scenario in our longer term outlook, but we will be well positioned to meet that need when it arises.","In the meantime, we remain very confident in our business and are focused on making a strong franchise even stronger.","Let me conclude by thanking our outstanding employees for their performance during the quarter and for the work they continue to do every day to deliver another year of very strong results. And thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials.","Now, if the Operator will give the required instructions we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson","Good morning. First going to focus on more specific states. For Georgia in particular how much of your strength was driven by the new funding initiatives with House Bill 170, new rail lines in Savannah, or just overall improved economic health of the State. Just really helping us to balance because each of those are different types of buckets one being a new business opportunity, one being new funding and one is just day-to-day business.","Tom Hill","At this point Kathryn, it's all just organic growth in Georgia. You aren't seeing flow through from the new highway funding. Might see a little bit towards the end of this year, but that's really going to be 2017 and 2018, so that's just really healthy growth in Georgia.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. And nothing really from the new rail line to Savannah?","Tom Hill","Not at this point.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Flipping to two states that were softer, California, Virginia. Virginia we were well aware of some of the wet weather, but specifically addressing those two states, to what degree were volumes impacted by large project delays, wet weather or any other relevant factor we should take into consideration and if you're able to comment on how trends are progressing in each of those states as we go into Q3.","Tom Hill","Yes. I think if you're asking me, do we see some kind of change or deceleration in demand growth in these states or -- the answer is no. Both the private side, residential is very healthy, non-res saw a little bit of softening in the second quarter, but the leading indicators in the pipeline very healthy. The public side will only get better. We'll see a little bit of a lull in California while they are responding. But overall, we don't see any deceleration in either one of these states.","I think that take them one at a time. California very positive. Our strength there is large commercial and highway projects. We saw a lull in that of recent, commercial side some of our customers maybe didn't pick up as much work of late as we would have liked. In Canada, we can do a better job with that. On the highway side, we'll see a little bit of a short-term decrease in funding because of gas price, lower gas prices, but that's got to rectify itself. California is rated the worst roads in the U.S. There's a number of bills in the State government for funding from roughly $3.5 billion -- increase of $3.5 billion up to $7 billion. And then there's I think around more than 10 measures that are on the ballot for November for local and county work that would total roughly an increase -- annual increase of about $2 billion. So overall, California is going to be fine.","Virginia as you said we saw extreme weather and also had a little bit of timing with projects we had two big projects last year the midtown tunnel and a large wind farm that was going. We had one pushback this year the Fairfield marine terminal. But, just to give you a little flavor around that. If you took three large jobs that are coming I66 in Northern Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay bridge job, and the Fairfield marine which I just mentioned, that would be -- put those jobs together you're going to be around 7 million tons. So demand in Virginia will continue to grow.","John McPherson","And Kathryn, it's John. Just to put a little more color on the four states we called out and just to give you support, and again, to echo Tom's point, we do not see any cyclical change here in these states or across our portfolio. Really the only one if you back up and take a trailing 12-month look that's down on volume for us is Illinois. And we've talked about Illinois before that's just a bit of a different fiscal picture rolling over some large projects that we didn't have this year that we did have last year. That's the one place the demand growth outlook just isn't as clear. Everything else that we're calling out is primarily a timing issue. It's weather related, it's pulling work forward into the first quarter, or it's just how large projects get started and they flow through the pipeline so Illinois is a little bit different but everywhere else is basically on the same track that its been.","Kathryn Thompson","And Illinois, how should we think about modeling Illinois not just for the next quarter, but for 2016 and what's your view going forward and how we should think about modeling Illinois volume? Is it a situation where we should expect a decline or flat, any color would be helpful? Thank you.","Tom Hill","We probably expect in Illinois and I'll make sure we follow-up on this with you. But, just to give you a sense, I'd expect flat to kind of low single digit growth from where we are today. Going forward, so it's not rapid decline, it's just not the same kind of growth on the shipment side. Now the other thing we call out in these states, California, Texas, Virginia, Illinois of note is the businesses are still strong, so don't take near-term volume challenges as fundamental business challenges. I mean just to give you a sense, those four states had pricing growth over the last 12 months in the double digits.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay.","Tom Hill","They had improvement in cash margin per ton over the last 12 months over 20%. And so the businesses are good and sound. It's just a question of project timing and flow. Virginia for example, was up strongly in volume in the first quarter over 20%. So we probably pulled some work forward there. We call it Illinois because it's the one place we just don't see the same kind of longer term robust growth that we see in rest of our portfolio.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, great. And final question for me today. You talked about mix and geographic mix having an impact on average pricing in the quarter. Are you able to give a little bit more granularity of which was a greater factor in the quarter? Thank you.","Tom Hill","I think it was a combination of the two. We saw shipments get impacted in coastal Texas with weather, extreme weather and some timing of projects, it's healthy pricing, so that was geographic. And then, you saw some substantial base jobs and shot rock jobs particularly in Florida, so you put all those together was just under a percent.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","John McPherson","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could just say more about what you saw demand by end-market across your footprint sounds like private non-res may have slowed, can you just flush that out for us either based on shipments in the quarter or based on indications that you're hearing from your customers? Thanks.","Tom Hill","Yes. I think what we've seen is the growth in recent activities weakened just a little bit. Longer term our backlogs are growing, the pipeline has strengthened, employment levels and other factors point to sustained growth and at any given time that activity at different geographies will vary pretty widely. But, if you look at the leading indicators, the Dodge Momentum Index, ABI, they point to renewed pace of growth in 2017 and beyond. And then just simple fact that you've got single-family construction growing at the pace it's growing will pull non-res up and that we'll see that coming.","Jerry Revich","Okay.","Tom Hill","Our shipments to private non-res work in the quarter were still pretty healthy. So they can vary market-to-market. But I think we've all probably called the death of non-res spending prematurely several times now. Even if we see a little bit of weakness in near-term start indicators with our customers, and then, the data we look at we're seeing just as much if not more strength in the longer term pipelines. We still see growth across all of the India segments we are talking about.","With the one thing that surprised us being slow kind of jumps out is really public infrastructure spending. So again, the outlook there is strong, but we haven't seen as much in public infrastructure as we would expect it so far this year giving all the fundamentals, all of the fundamentals are there, but the spending really hasn't been quite where we thought it would have been.","Jerry Revich","And John, Tom, can you say more about that last point? Is it an issue of timing in terms of some bigger jobs getting started or getting the bidding process done, what are you seeing as driving that delay and how broad based is it?","John McPherson","On the infrastructure piece, it's really just now you're starting to see the big capital projects, water, airports those kind of projects. If you look at tax receipts in our markets they are at or near all-time highs. So it's going to happen. It's just a matter of timing and I think the local governments making the decision to go forward with the capital projects. But you'll see that come on in 2017 and probably more in 2018.","Jerry Revich","Okay.","John McPherson","And it's a little bit of -- I'm going to call it a little bit of conjecture from us Jerry. But, we at least hear some comments about just I'm going to call it overall election cycle uncertainty, putting some near term breaks, some public infrastructure spending in some places. But again, as Tom said some of the spending on things like sewers and water infrastructure is not even really discretionary if you're going to build as much new residential, as we are building you are going to have to build new water. So it's really a question of timing in our view, but its one area that so far in 2016 we haven't seen the kind of growth we would have expected.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And lastly, I'm wondering if you can comment on how volumes and pricing looked in July, so May obviously stands out as a month of downside in the quarter. Can you just give us some context on how July looked?","John McPherson","Well, Jerry I'll jump in and say as the CFO that we can't comment on the third quarter yet. But in the spirit of that question, I guess one thing I'd note is, if May had had the same kind of shipping rate trends that we had seen in June and April, you would probably have a very different feel to this call and results. We wouldn't be asking some of these questions. So as Tom said it's not uncommon to have some variability in shipping rates week-to-week, month-to-month in a business it's all outdoors. But again, we haven't seen anything from our view that would indicate any kind of deceleration or anything that would take us off long-term trend. This is still a business with solid outlook for 2016, strengthening visibility for 2017 and in our view multiple years of growth ahead of us.","Jerry Revich","All right. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital Markets.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to -- and maybe this is for John. You guys had commented on your last conference call that the high-end of the range for capital spending would be around $400 million this year and I think you're about running at $200 million. And what are your expectations? Are you going to still keep up with that $400 million number or given what you're seeing in the market are you going to tap the brakes a little bit?","John McPherson","I think Bob, we'll keep up with that number. But let me give you a couple of important reminders. Our core CapEx spending as a portion of that $400 million is about $ 275 million. So think about that as core operating maintenance capital. And then there's another $125 million in that number that's essentially growth capital. Non-M&A growth capital.","So our CapEx outlook both now and through the balance of the recovery remains unchanged. We have not seen anything in the marketplace conditions and I'd underscore this that would cause us to put brakes on our own capital spending or on our pursuit of M&A. Again, our view on the business and its outlook if anything is probably strengthening, so nothing from a external market condition point of view that would cause us to adjust our capital spending.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you. And one question on profitability. Your gross margin expansion was pretty tremendous at 500 basis points and that came in ahead of what we were anticipating and I wanted to understand what were the drivers of that? Was it more about getting favorable pricing as obviously a huge tailwind for that, but how much was also operating leverage and what kind of relief did you get from lower costs for diesel fuel?","John McPherson","Yes, Bob, obviously we had healthy price in the quarter and that will continue. But I thought our folks did a really nice job with their operating costs particularly with a little bit lower volumes and they continue to not only leverage the volume, but also just improve on the key operating efficiencies and disciplines that drive the profitability of the business. So it was a combination of the two. To answer your question on diesel, total diesel was an impact of about $7 million.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. Okay. And just one final. I think you guys doubled your spend on share buybacks for the quarter from $23 million in the first quarter to $46 million. Any thoughts as you look out into the back half of the year about share buyback activity and what's left under the authorization? Thanks and good luck.","John McPherson","Thanks, Bob. I think we have over 2 million shares left on the authorization. So I think that it's not a question of authorization. Our path on share repurchase I would call unchanged as we've said before, we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders at this point in the cycle primarily through share repurchase, we'll remain opportunistic in doing so as opposed to give any particular commitment to a certain level of repurchase activity in advance. But again, our basic approach to capital allocation remains unchanged and as such, we may continue to repurchase shares as another way to return capital to shareholders.","Operator","We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms","Hi, good morning.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Trey.","Trey Grooms","Couple of questions on kind of getting back to the lull in the large projects that you guys mentioned. I know you touched on some of the public stuff, but you also mentioned that there was some private projects there. And then also, May being the weaker month in the quarter, I'm guessing weather played a big role there that you highlighted. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is that the timing of when these projects that were either pushed to the right or what have you when those could come through. I mean, is that a third quarter event or fourth quarter would they be more like into 2017? How do we think about the timing?","Tom Hill","Well, I think it will be all over the place obviously with large projects. Let me give you kind of a little bit of a view on some large projects and put a little flavor on that. So if you look at Virginia for example, I mentioned Northern Virginia, the Route 66 projects will be probably 6 million tons, I85 and that job actually will go in 2017, I85 in Southern Virginia is over 800,000 tons, but you'll see some of that in 2016, but a lot has got pushed into 2017. And in North Carolina, the I85 widening it's probably 1.2 million tons and those will see a little bit of that in 2016, but a -- majority of it in 2017 and the Northwest Corridor in Atlanta is 1.5 million and that's the widening of I75 and it's a 1.5 million tons and that will probably do a little more, we will probably get 700,000, 600,000 tons in 2016.","So it will be all over the place. And again, as John said earlier, it's going to be a matter of timing. The good news is the contractors and our customers want to get the work done, they are going to press to get it done because they have visibility and know what's coming in 2017, and so they've got to get this off their books so they can free their crews up and go on to other projects. So the desires there, it's just a matter of, will they have the crews in the fourth quarter, will the weather allow them to do it.","Trey Grooms","Right. So kind of with that, I'm just trying to get a feel for how we should be thinking about the quarterly cadence kind of looking into the back half. Third Quarter or Q3 obviously faces a tougher comp, but it's also generally a seasonally stronger quarter for you guys and then with kind of the back drop of weather and how things have moved around, anything unique about the seasonal cadence or your expectation there as we look in the back half?","Tom Hill","I don't think there's anything unique about it except for very similar to last year. I would underscore what I just said about the contracts and desire to get it done. They are pressed even more in 2016 than they were in 2015 to get this work done because there's so much work coming for 2017. You'll see both on the commercial side and highway side, so desires there and the third quarter is always healthy, but depending on weather the fourth quarter could be great too. We'll decide to just wait and see.","Trey Grooms","Got it. And then, last one for me and John, I mean, you guys in the whole team impressive incrementals and gross profit per ton. And I think last quarter you said that you expect to see incrementals for this year a little higher than the longer term kind of 60% target. And with half the year behind us now and the current cost environment, can you update us on your thoughts there?","John McPherson","Sure, Terry. I think we still say 60% is our long-term as in through the entire recovery and expansion cycle number but that's a multi-year view. We've obviously been doing better than that of late, sometimes substantially better. I think for the balance of the year, I'm not sure we see a much different trajectory than we've been on so far this year in terms of incrementals. Some of that in a very short period of time if you took an individual month or maybe an individual quarter can be influenced by the mix of price and volume in our growth. But overall, our team has continued to do a great job.","Again, I come back to something Tom said in his remarks. The work is there. The demand is there. Importantly Terry to your question, the profitability is there, core profitability in our business maybe running a little ahead of our plan. And so we come down to for 2016 is really a question of timing of the shipments and how much gets done this year versus next. But again, the work is there, the demand is there and importantly the profitability is there and we see that trend continuing.","Trey Grooms","Great. That's it for me. Thanks a lot.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Garik Shmois, Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","Hi, thank you. First question is, just you talked about the weakness in Illinois sounds like there's a fundamental change perhaps when you think about that market. Could you just speak to perhaps the importance of that market strategically. And then just broadly what you're seeing and what your appetite is for either acquisitions or divestments at this point in the cycle?","Tom Hill","First of all, as John said, you've got a lot of well known funding and budget issues, although they did reaffirm the highway spending in Illinois on one hand the positive and they also cut the toll way spending in half, which will cost us about $700 million in the State for next year. I think the positive side of that is you're still seeing growth on the private side. And as John said, this is a very good business for us and we have a very, very strong market position and our teams up there have done a great job of improving their unit margins even with some falling volume.","Some of that volume Garik is, we were at two very large jobs one at O'Hare and one the toll way that we were working on last year and we're starting to wind down so some of that's just again timing of projects. But overall, it's a strong market for us and an important market and one that I think our folks have done a nice job improving.","Garik Shmois","Okay. And could you touch on just second part of the question with respect to M&A at this point in the cycle, what are you seeing out there as far as valuations are concerned, what's your appetite for additional deals and how do you balance that relative to your capital structure?","Tom Hill","They're still out there. We've got a number of them as John said in his comments that we're working on, when they will close is always, each one separate, each one is timing. But you always have to be disciplined about what you're buying and what you are paying and what the unique synergies that we have for Vulcan are and how do we leverage those so it's there. We're hot on that trail and we've got a number of them in the pipeline.","John McPherson","And only thing we would add to your question, which I think we also addressed in our comments is, if anything we're pushing harder on opportunities particularly those that fit us strategically. We're going to stay disciplined on valuations obviously but we've worked hard to be in a position where we now have the financial capacity to really do good deals where they exist, to make the right ongoing capital investments in our business and to return some capital to shareholders so we can balance all those things and we will certainly have the financial flexibility to pursue M&A of that growth. All that said we're going to stay really disciplined about it.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks just want to shift as my follow-up question to the coastal markets in Texas clearly weather impacted demand in May in particular. Are you seeing anything fundamentally changing or decelerating along the coast? If so, how does that impact the productivity out of your Cancun quarry, and then, also would there be anything for us to think about over the maybe in the medium term if there is deceleration in the coastal markets in Texas around price mix given it was a headwind in the quarter?","Tom Hall","I think that the story as you said in Texas was the coastal piece of it. Weather was a big impact. Let's face it coastal Texas was under water for more than a month and so that impacted. We also had as John says timing of large projects we have the grand parkway and some big energy projects we are working on last year. We've worked some of that work off, there's still some in the pipeline, golden pass, Beaumont LNG, so you'll see that come -- some of those tons come back next year.","It's hard to tell what's going on in res and non-res with the weather pattern we had in the second quarter, probably some softening in Houston. But behind that, you've got huge increases in highway spending that we've seen some of that in 2015 and 2016 but you're going to see more of that in 2017 and 2018 and 2019.","And nothing Garik was already summed up, the visibility is not great because the weather is so bad, in a quarter where you have volumes drop to 30% in one market, it's hard to get a lot of visibility with that kind of drop. But as you look at it, you've got strengthening public spending that should offset potentially some weakening private spending. We haven't seen that weakening elsewhere in Texas yet by the way. The little bit we've seen around Houston we've not seen spread to the rest of Texas.","And finally your question about price impact or impact on logistics out of our quarry in Mexico, I don't think anything I'd call material anyway-- ","Tom Hall","Well, I think you have to remember the quarter in Mexico we shipped to some 17-18 port facilities all the way around from Brownsville all the way around to Jacksonville, Florida. So where you might have some temporary softening and timing of projects on the coast of Texas, you've got the Southeastern Florida and those markets picking up substantially. So there's a lot of flexibility in that overall business. And we think we're fine with it.","John McPherson","And again on pricing, which is just really a mixed issue not a fundamental underlying price issue. I don't think we would expect these kind of declines we saw in the second quarter and future quarters. So I don't see anything that I would try and model in on pricing.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Timna Tanners, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Hey, good morning guys. ","Tom Hall","Good morning.","Timna Tanners","So I was curious about your comment on the election year having a numbing effect or people whatever you said maybe on the local side. And just wanted to get a sense of, if you could characterize the political sentiment you're getting from you're canvassing of Washington in light of kind of the positive spirit of dialogue lately on public infrastructure spending.","Tom Hall","I think the good news there is everybody is talking about it. Both Presidential candidates, who got a number of people in Washington concerned about the countries infrastructure. They all know it's an issue. And they also understand that it is stimulus if we do it correctly. So like I said we have a five year bill, but we still have degraded highway system and that bill is not going to improve that grade. So it is an issue and now what's going to happen we don't know, we know what's going to happen with the election, but it is an important issue in one that people are putting out there in front of everyone.","John McPherson","And Timna, it's John because I may have made the comments just to add to that. And my comments weren't reflective on the nature of the dialogue around future infrastructure spending which we actually as Tom said is quite positive at a federal level, State level and local level across many of our geographies. It's more just a negative tone and some degree of uncertainty that would seem to affect private investment levels. And you'll know more about this than us but you may have seen some of that in second quarter GDP data. And we probably have some customers who on balance just given negative tone out there particularly on the private side are a little more reluctant than they would be in a different time to add their own additional capacity to make their own big capital investments whether that's a new equipment or land for development or larger staffs.","So I wouldn't want to make it too big a deal. What's interesting though is, just this disconnect between the tone you're going to hear in the middle of an election cycle which is really negative and what we see in our own business which frankly is pretty positive but nothing longer term, the dialogue around higher levels of public infrastructure spending particularly on road infrastructure and other infrastructure we are pretty excited about.","Timna Tanners","Okay. And then to wrap up with a couple other thematic questions. So are you seeing much for small on labor constraints that we've been hearing about on construction? Is that an issue at all for you? Second of all, how good is your visibility relative to normal levels in light of that kind of more cautious sentiment?","Tom Hall","I think that the first of all the labor issue, yes, we're seeing shortages with our customers whether it's ready mix truck drivers or finishers or carpenters on residential. So there are constraints -- there are labor constraints out there. And it is a bottleneck for our customers and therefore for us. I think they are working through it. We've been on this theme for now about a year and that's actually good news because it means it's growing and it's growing faster than they can fill the ranks and the work isn't going to go anywhere it's a matter of getting enough timing.","John McPherson","And on your question about normal, it wouldn't change our view of normal, but as we've discussed many times before, these bottlenecks whether they are labor or others that some of our customers face, they probably do constrain on the margin, the rate of growth or the rate of recovery keeping us for now in the 7%, 8%, 9% rate as opposed to something that the underlying demand would justify being higher. Flip side is that it can create a generally positive pricing climate but it may make for a longer recovery at a slightly slower rate like that 7%, 8%, 9% rate as opposed to something that would get up into the sustained double digits for a very long period of time.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Stanley Elliott, Stifel.","Stanley Elliott","Hi, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. A quick question on the outlook for costs -- the unit costs on the aggregate side. Obviously, the incrementals are going to be strong this year. Diesel has been a bit of a tailwind. How much longer can diesel realistically, be a tailwind for you guys and then maybe speak to some of the investments that you're making either on the sales side or on the production side to help us keep these incrementals as strong as they are or at least tracking above your historical average.","Tom Hall","As you look out towards the second half of the year and the price of diesel last year versus the price of diesel this year is probably not going to be a big cost advantage going forward. I think that -- as I said earlier, I think our folks are doing a really good job of concentrating on our own operating efficiencies that we can control. Volumes are coming back, can help that. So I feel pretty good about our cost and our ability to take incremental revenues to the bottom line.","As far as capital projects, they are all over the place. Some is as simple as replacement of mobile equipment, screens and crushers, usually when you do plant capitalist a combination of both replacement and process improvement to get more throughput or reduce down time, which helps on your cost obviously other than just like-for-like replacement.","On the growth side, we've got a number of facilities who are working on our distribution network both rail and blue water that were all of them are different stages of completion and then we've got a number of greenfield projects that we're working on at different stages in completion.","John McPherson","Only additional color I would add is while we may not have the same tailwinds from diesel moving forward we should be beginning to work out of a period where we had elevator repair maintenance costs kind of earlier in the recovery. So we're hopeful those trends will offset each other a little bit some more work to do there.","And just a reminder we've got a lot of fixed costs yet to leverage in this recovery. So as Tom said we're pretty proud of what our teams did and particularly as an example in a quarter without much volume growth and still with very uneven production schedules due to weather challenges to control your costs in a quarter like the one we just finished, is a good sign of the right disciplines, so we have a pretty positive outlook about our margin performance looking forward.","Stanley Elliott","Absolutely I agree. And just a reminder, when do the new ships come on line? Is there anyway to talk about either improved efficiency or cost savings or anything along those lines around the ten new vessels? ","Tom Hall","Yes. They will come on line at different stages next year. And they will both be more efficient both particularly in fuel also they have less draft and more tonnage capacity. So we'll see improvements cost wise with those ships as they come on line and we'll be excited to get those.","John McPherson","Probably a little early to talk about it specifically though. That may be something more a 2017 item probably a little too early to talk about it specifically but they are good investments.","Stanley Elliott","That sounds fair. And then, lastly on the M&A side, obviously, plenty of flexibility within the capital structure, are you thinking more on the bolt-on side or there new markets you'd be interested in entering, how should we think about that from a footprint perspective?","Tom Hall","Both, primarily bolt-on. I mean those are some of our best returns and it proves out the efficiencies in the overall franchise, but and it's healthy, so and then as far as new markets we did that 18 months ago in New Mexico and where we have a path to number one or number two position, we'll look at new places and if not we probably won't.","Stanley Elliott","Is it still fair to say mostly aggregate focused and potentially some downstream assets but certainly not the primary focus?","Tom Hall","You said it well. We like aggregates.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect guys. Thanks very much and best of luck.","Tom Hall","Thank you.","John McPherson","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Norfleet, Alembic Global Advisors.","Nick Chen","Hi. This is Nick Chen for Rob. Thanks for taking our question this afternoon. You guys touched on a little bit earlier just discussing California, but I was hoping you could opine a bit on just some of the State level funding bills that you guys are tracking and sort of where you expect them to have the biggest impact going forward?","Tom Hall","Sure. I talked about California. They were going to lose a little bit of funding but there are a number of three bills in particular that would add between $3 billion and $7 billion. And they have to address their roads, and then, the local impact, which is in total if they all pass would be $2 billion a year. So Texas is one of the fastest growing highway markets. We saw a 30 in our markets in Texas in just the highway lengths alone. In 2016, we'll see an improvement of over 30%, state is a whole improvement of over 20% and a lot of that will really actually go in 2017. And then you'll have improved funding again in both 2017 and 2018. That will go up about 15% or 20% in 2017, and then, there's another over $2 billion that comes on to Texas in 2018.","Georgia basically doubled their highway funding that passed a year ago and we'll see a little bit of that in 2016 as I said earlier majority will come in 2017 and 2018. North Carolina has improved their funding as has Florida, as has South Carolina, as has Virginia. There are bills being discussed in Alabama and probably won't be addressed until 2017.","I'd tell you a similar story in Tennessee where it needs to be addressed, they have not, it won't happen in 2016, hopefully will happen in 2017. So as I said, a lot of our states have marked improvement in funding and the vast majority of that except for Texas will flow through in 2017 and 2018. So we're really looking forward to this. And this was a real bright part of our future.","Nick Chen","That's really helpful. Thanks so much.","Tom Hall","You bet.","Operator","We'll go to Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Thanks. Good morning.","Tom Hall","Good morning.","Brent Thielman","Is there a way to think about the moving pieces of these various issues in May in terms of the impact you reported average price for the quarter?","Tom Hall","I think the average price as I said earlier was healthy in spite of some geographic and product mix issue, probably one of the bigger impacts in the quarter was on that was -- just the mix issue was coastal Texas as John said volumes were down 30%. It's a very -- it has healthy pricing and so that had a little bit of an impact. But overall, the environment for pricing across our footprint remains healthy, it's strong, throughout the entire construction segment pricing is moving up and that's driven by demand increases and is also driven by the visibility of what everybody sees coming in 2017 and 2018.","JohnMcPherson","Just giving little more color if it helps, I think our average selling prices, if you take all of the moving pieces and adjust as best you can on a like-for-like basis probably would have been $0.03 or $0.04 higher than what we reported. Again, a lot of that is having a big decline in coastal Texas. Now at the same time that's accounting for some of our South Eastern markets which have good pricing too growing pretty quickly. So on a total like-for-like basis, when you look at geographic issues and the product mix issues, our rate of price growth year-over-year would have been a little closer to eight than what we reported. But I wouldn't let any of that distract you from what Tom said which is the core pricing outlook and climate remains positive given where we are in the recovery.","And I'd also just remind you prices went up pretty healthy in those very same markets that were volume challenged, so Virginia, Illinois, California, Texas those are all markets that have had good pricing and margin improvement not just in this quarter but for the last few quarters.","Brent Thielman","Okay. That's helpful. And then you've talked about the variability and timing of all of these large projects in terms of volumes. When we think about your outlook for potential volume for the year and kind of the company overall, is it more heavily impacted by larger projects than what we would typically see?","Tom Hall","No. I don't think it's more. I think this is just a piece of it. So part of it is going to be the large projects. As we said earlier part of it just across the entire market segments is going to be, can the contractors and can our customers get the work done in the time that they have. So we talked about labor shortages, you have those and those are an issue so it's about both timing of large projects, our customers ability to get work out. And then how many days do we have of construction in the fourth quarter. All that will go together to really see how the year turns out. But I'll remind you this is exactly what we saw in 2015.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Margard, Rainier Investment Management.","Jim Margard","Hi. Thank you. Could you comment a little bit more on the mix as you mentioned, the Texas coastal situation was impactful and presumably that mix will turn more favorable so simply by virtue of that. But could you elaborate a little bit more going into the future and also were there any other mix issues other than coastal Texas and as you go more into your bigger infrastructure build, in 2017 and 2018 what are the implications for the mix in that?","Tom Hall","Well, first of all, in the quarter, pricing was a combination of the mix impact was both geographic which was Texas and then mix. So we had some large base work in the southeast and we also had large shot rock projects in Florida. And while they may have an impact on price it has a overall positive impact on profitability because you've got to sell those mix of products and some of them are cheaper to make. And so the price of the margins while the price maybe lower the margin is very healthy and you need to sell the full product line to maximize profitability in our operations.","On your question about highway construction and coming highway construction, that really plays into our hand in that -- it is a really healthy mix of what our plants produce. It has a combination of base and fines because it's new construction and it has asphalt rock, it has concrete rock, so it gives the full flavor of everything we produce and just pushes the overall profitability up.","John McPherson","And when you think about it geographically, we really like the -- particularly -- well, we like it now, we like it longer term, the breadth and positioning of our particular geographic mix. These trends we're seeing and where we see the growth and the nature of the increased public spending we commented on earlier. If anything these should give us tailwinds from a geographic mix point of view. We're well positioned against where the growth is coming.","Tom Hall","Over and beyond that on aggregates it also fits into our hand with our asphalt business. So we have very strong positions in a number of states with asphalt, which is a lot more public driven, so all of the spending on highways will help that business.","Jim Margard","Great. Thank you.","Tom Hall","You're welcome.","Operator","At this time, we'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hill for closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials and we look forward to talking to you this quarter and over the balance of the year. And I would like to thank our employees for all of their hard work and the things they do to make this company great. Thanks.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22080":["Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call February 14, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Mark Warren - Director, Investor Relations","Tom Hill - Chairman and CEO","Suzanne Wood - Senior Vice President and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.","Mike Dahl - RBC Capital Markets","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Scott Schrier - Citi","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Garik Shmois - Longbow","Phil Ng - Jefferies","Stanley Elliott - Stifel","Adam Thalhimer - Thompson Davis","Brent Thielman - D.A.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder today\u2019s call is being recorded.","Now I would like to turn the call over to your host Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren you may begin.","Mark Warren","Good morning. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow their prepared remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. A recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Additionally, you can sign-up to receive future news releases through to the quick links on the Investor Relations homepage.","Finally, please be reminded that comments regarding the company\u2019s results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks along with our other legal disclaimers are described in detail in the company\u2019s earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company. In addition to discussing the fourth quarter and full year results, we will also touch on several other matters of interests, including our improving pricing dynamic, our view on 2019 demand and shipments, and our financial expectations for 2019. Suzanne will review the financial shortly.","But first, let me get right to the notable things about the fourth quarter that set us up for a strong 2019. The quarter was a great finish to the year. We delivered a 24% increase in gross profit in our core Aggregates segment. We enjoyed solid shipment growth, compounding price improvements and discipline cost control.","A principal driver of the strength in the quarter was an 8% increase in total Aggregates shipments, 4% on a same-store basis. These higher shipments were largely due to the growing demand in the public sector.","The many increases in state and local highway funding that we have seen across our footprint are now turning into shipments. We are in the very early stages of big growth in highway demand. Shipments in the quarter rebounded in Texas and Virginia, states that are among our more profitable markets, and solid growth continued in Florida Arizona Alabama and Illinois.","Our pricing dynamic also improved in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of mix, our freight-adjusted pricing increased approximately 5% compared to last year\u2019s quarter, including mix, pricing increased 2% due to stronger shipments in relatively lower priced markets such as Alabama, Arizona and Illinois.","We have seen improving pricing momentum quarter-after-quarter. This ongoing momentum sets the stage as we move into 2019. It\u2019s supported by improved backlogs of private and public work, customer confidence, demand visibility and logistics constraints.","Throughout the quarter and the year we were highly focused on operating efficiencies and cost control. For the quarter, we converted all of our higher revenue into gross profit, finishing the full year with a 12-month same-store flow through rate of 64% in our Aggregates segment.","Overall, for the full year we, increased total revenues, earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and adjusted EBITDA, while decreasing our overhead expenses as a percent of total revenues. For the full year, we achieved record Aggregates cash gross profit per ton of $6.32.","Our safety performance, which is a leading indicator of operational excellence and proper stewardship of our most important resource, which is our people. I am immensely proud that we further advanced our safety performance improving on our record setting results from the previous year.","For 2018, our injury rate was 0.92 per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is world-class. This is a great tribute to the performance of our people throughout our company. Our performance in our core Aggregates business improved throughout 2018. The momentum we generated and these positive trends in our Aggregates business will play forward into 2019.","We continue to see growth in private demand in Vulcan-served markets. In the public sector, demand growth is coming on strong and it\u2019s most notable in the markets that we serve. Nine Vulcan states that generate almost 80% of our revenue have passed infrastructure legislation over the last three years. These laws have raise funding by almost 60% over 2015 levels.","Altogether, state laws and local initiatives to increase transportation infrastructure revenue have added more than $20 billion annually of funding in just these nine Vulcan states. That\u2019s nearly half as much as the federal government provides each year for all 50 states.","So the pace of the conversion of public funding and lettings into shipments continues to accelerate and while the timing of those shipments is never precise, the direction is clearly up. This creates a healthy and positive pricing environment.","Our backlogs and booking pace are in great shape and are improving. This along with our 2019 fixed plant price increases gives us confidence in the growing strength of 2019.","Now I will turn the call over to Suzanne for a more detailed view of the numbers.","Suzanne Wood","Thanks, Tom, and good morning. I will cover some key points from the full year and then move on to our 2019 guidance. For the year just ended, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.132 billion. This represented a 15% improvement over 2017 and was achieved despite significantly higher diesel fuel and liquid asphalt costs. Diesel costs increased $26 million or 25% in 2018 and liquid asphalt costs were up $54 million or 32%.","Gross profit in our Aggregates segment increased 16% in the year, our unit profitability increased 6% and our margins expanded due to solid growth in shipments, compounding pricing improvements and operating efficiencies.","For the full year, shipments grew by 10% or, on a same-store basis 6%, mix adjusted pricing increased by 3.5% improving as the year progressed, and importantly, our same-store unit cost of sales decreased by 2%, more than offsetting the higher diesel costs, I mentioned earlier.","Together with our improved Aggregates pricing, this disciplined approach to cost resulted in the 64% same-store flow through for the full year that Tom mentioned earlier. These results demonstrate the strength of our Aggregates-focused business even when we experience headwinds.","As stated last quarter, we remain focused on the things we can control such as our cost base and the efficiencies and operating leverage that drive our Aggregates\u2019 profitability. We focus on these rather than things not in our control such as cost pressures, inclement weather or the precise timing of large project starts. Our focus on accountability is a large part of our success and we will continue these disciplines.","Now with respect to the non-aggregates part of our business, it was a bit of a mixed bag. For the Concrete segment, gross profit increased by 10% year-over-year. On the other hand, the Asphalt segment had a challenging year with liquid asphalt costs negatively affecting gross profit.","While we were able to increase our own prices to customers by approximately 6% in the full year, much of the rise in liquid asphalt costs occurred in the second half and so we were unable to fully offset the higher annual costs, and as a result, the Asphalt segment\u2019s full year gross profit declined by $35 million or 38%. We will continue our efforts to price so as to offset these costs, but the impact will be gradual as we cycle through existing contracts.","In the accompanying slide, you will find information on our cash flows for the full year, but I will quickly recap the more noteworthy items.","In the year, we spent $222 million on operating and maintenance capital in line with our prior estimate. Our growth CapEx investment was $247 million, a bit lower than our guidance during the third quarter call. While some of this difference is timing related, we do remain disciplined with our capital spending and continue our careful review of the nature and scope of projects.","In 2018, we also invested $221 million in bolt-on acquisitions, which complemented our existing positions and expanded our capabilities in Alabama California and Texas. And finally, we returned $282 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases compared to $193 million in 2017.","So moving on to 2019, when we last spoke with you, we shared a preliminary outlook that called for mid single-digit growth in shipments and pricing for Aggregates, with the caveat that our detailed budget development and reviews were under way.","Having concluded those processes our current expectations are in line with those earlier assumptions. We expect continued demand growth in our markets, particularly on the public side and this view is supported by what we are seeing in our backlogs and new bookings.","Specifically, for 2019, we expect Aggregates shipments growth of 3% to 5% and freight-adjusted price increases of 5% to 7%. Additionally, we maintain our longer term view of an approximate 60% same-store flow through rate to gross profit on a trailing 12-month basis, understanding that like this year the rate can vary quarter-to-quarter.","Turning to our non-aggregates segments which include Asphalt and Concrete, we expect 15% to 20% growth in gross profit collectively with the assumption of relatively stable liquid asphalt costs.","SAG expenses in the year are forecast to be $355 million, reflecting higher revenues. Notably, our SAG expenses as a percentage of revenues continue to decline and we remain focused on efficiently leveraging our overhead costs.","We anticipate that interest expense will be approximately $130 million and that the category of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization together will approximate $360 million. The combination of these assumptions results in a 2019 adjusted EBITDA range of $1.25 billion to $1.33 billion, with the low end of that range representing a double-digit increase as compared to 2018.","Now, as you know, our business is an inherently cash generative one and 2019 will be no exception. As you model our cash flows for the year I will share some thoughts with you that will help you fill in the blanks. The most important point is that we will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities and will stay within our debt leverage target range.","We project the non-discretionary uses of cash to be as follows in the year. Cash interest expense of $125 million, operating and maintenance CapEx of $250 million, and finally, cash taxes of $160 million.","The discretionary uses of our cash involve returns to shareholders, internal growth capital and acquisitions. So let me touch on each of these. First, we expect to maintain a progressive dividend, generally growing it in line with earnings to a level that is fully sustainable through the cycle.","Second, we expect to spend approximately $200 million on growth CapEx for projects that are largely underway. These include the opening of strategic quarries in California, Texas and South Carolina, as well as improvements to our logistics and distribution network and sales yards.","Third, we will continue our disciplined evaluation of acquisition opportunities as they arise and we will only invest in those which fit our strategy and which offers superior returns and synergies.","And last but not least, we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders.","As I conclude my comments on our 2019 guidance, let me quickly address our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, strong balance sheet structure and debt-to-EBITDA leverage between 2 times and 2.5 times.","Currently, our weighted-average debt maturity is 15 years and our long-term weighted average interest rate is 4.6%. This debt profile, together with our strong cash flow, gives us the flexibility to sensibly and responsibly manage our business. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we will be disciplined in the use of that capital, always seeking to improve our returns and shareholder value.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Thanks, Suzanne. I am proud of our people\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Despite serious external disruptions in 2018 and large increases in the cost of liquid asphalt and diesel fuel, we still delivered strong top and bottomline growth, while also growing the business in strategic locations.","Our strategy is clear and compelling. Our operational structure is lean and locally led and our positions in attractive long-term growth markets are simply unrivaled. Our teams perform to high standards, focused on continuous improvement. We are well-equipped to take advantage of market opportunities or market challenges.","We have big goals for 2019. These goals are focused on improving our performance in our operating disciplines, how we service our customers and how we grow our people. We are leveraging our strengths and growth opportunities further building on the deep engagement we have in the day-to-day improvement of our business.","We also continue our strategic focus on logistics all across our footprint, encompassing rail, trucking, Blue Water and our barge system, with a focus on improving internal efficiencies, while continuing to enhance the customer experience.","We are excited about 2019 and the following years for a number of reasons. Most notably, the sea change we are witnessing in the public sector investment in transportation infrastructure and the very positive impacts of our focus on growing unit margins. Moving forward, we are especially well suited to benefit as infrastructure demand in key Vulcan states continues to grow, fueled by these substantial increases in state and local funding.","Now we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.","Tom Hill","Good morning Trey.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Trey Grooms","Hey. Good morning, everyone. First off, I guess, I want to just ask on the pricing, 5% to 7% increase this year. Can you talk about, is there any mix expectations one way or the other there and any color you can give us maybe on how to think about cadence and any other driver factors behind that guide?","Tom Hill","Sure. As Suzanne and I both said, the pricing momentum in our business is clearly improving. We saw another big step up in the fourth quarter. If you look at \u201819, our confidence is really built on three things and three things that we have a lot of visibility to.","The first one would be our current booking prices continue to move up.","Number two, our bid and backlog prices are up. That\u2019s something we see very clearly and it constitutes about 60% of our business.","And then, third, Trey, we are experiencing solid price improvements in our January and our April prices increases to our fixed plant concrete and asphalt customers. We are seeing price increases across every one of our markets in \u201819.","Supporting that confidence is our customer\u2019s, the visibility they have in demand growth and it\u2019s really underpinned by the improving pipeline of big public work and solid backlogs of private work. I am pleased with the disciplines in our sales force and how they blew pricing up over the last two or three quarters.","There may be a little bit of positive geographic mix built into \u201819 but the reality is, if you look at our backlogs our bid work and fixed plant prices, they are all just definitely up as -- from where we were a year ago.","Trey Grooms","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then -- appreciate that. As a follow up, if you can give us a little more color on kind of how you build into that 3% to 5% volume. You mentioned solid growth of course in private demand and then I think you used the word strong growth in public demand. But any more color you could give us around your assumptions there, anything to note around weather or end market or you mentioned geographic mix, but just anything else that you could give us on how you build into that a little bit more granular?","Tom Hill","Yeah. So I think it\u2019s probably easier done if I just kind of take you around the country and talk about just maybe some different markets and it\u2019s a little bit of a long answer. But California -- starting with California in the west, we see solid volume and price growth in 2019. The public side is showing real strength with SB-1 measures starting to flow through and those projects starting to ship.","Private side continues to grow both in res and non-res. We may see a little bit of weakness in housing in the Bay Area, but other than that, the private side is good and we had strong pricing California in \u201818, we will continue to see that in \u201819.","Moving to Arizona, good growth strong growth in public and private res and non-res continue to be strong. We have got some big highway work that we started shipping in \u201818, it will flow all the way through \u201819, good pricing momentum.","Texas, very strong highway work in Texas as Prop 1 and Prop 7 money start kicking-in in \u201819. This will benefit Vulcan both in Aggregates and Asphalt. Housing remains strong, non-res, not quite as strong, but growing. Overall good demand, very good pricing momentum. Now, Coastal Texas is particularly strong, we had seen the downturn, we are back there both on the private and the public side.","Moving to the middle of the country, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois probably challenged demand, not as robust as the West Coast or the East Coast. But where we are encouraged about there is our execution on price cost particularly on unit margin and I am pleased with the team\u2019s performance and maybe even though they are facing some headwinds.","Tennessee, highway work will be very good as the Improve Act starts kicking in in \u201819. We will see both Aggregates and Asphalt on those projects, very good pricing environment, we either backlog or bidding some 25 Improve Act projects now.","Moving to the Southeast and that would include Georgia, South Carolina and Florida in this, very solid growth in all segments, a really strength for us and also very good pricing.","North -- from there North Carolina, strong growth, again, in all segments and healthy price improvements. The highways are starting to kick up and funding is starting to pick up in North Carolina. And then Virginia, solid growth in all segments also, with prices moving up. This will be a strong year with prices, as I said earlier, moving up across every one of our markets.","Trey Grooms","All right. Thank you very much. That\u2019s all very helpful. I will pass it on. Congrats on a good quarter.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Mike Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to actually follow up with my first question on the geographic commentary and drill down specifically into California and I was hoping that you would be able to give, if possible, a little more in the way of order of magnitude for growth on the public versus private and I am thinking within private specifically on those comments about residential. If we look at what the builders are reporting from an order standpoint, certainly some significant declines. Just curious kind of how much of that is just going to impact you guys with a lag or if there\u2019s something else driving the offsetting strength in residential?","Tom Hill","I will start with the public side. We think Caltrans is doing a good job accelerating to SB-1 funding and the lettings. We have already backlogged over 30 projects. We are -- we know of another 15 to 20 projects that will bid in the next few months. So they are really doing a good job of getting worked out, getting it let and we are starting to see -- starting to ship that.","Remember, in California, it does -- we are the largest Aggregate producer but we are also the largest Asphalt producer and these early jobs have a lot of hot mix in them. So we are very encouraged by Caltrans and how quickly they have taken that funding put in the lettings and we will see that work shift throughout 2019.","On the res side, I would tell you in the vast majority of markets in California, we continue to see growth in residential. As I called out, the Bay Area maybe -- would probably be the exception to that and that we will see some weakness there, when it\u2019s still -- the fundamentals are there and inventories are still quite low in California.","Non-res, we see strength in our backlogs and our booking phase in non-res. So we think we will see growth in California in non-res in \u201819.","Mike Dahl","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Tom Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Mike Dahl","My second question is with respect to the guidance around Asphalt and so just hoping to understand that a bit better, I think the combined three categories you are guiding for in dollar terms an increase of something like $16 million to $22 million in gross profit. So I think there\u2019s a comment that most of that\u2019s driven by the Asphalt part, but can you just give us a little more detail around how much improvement to expect in Asphalt and I know you mentioned timing, but just given where Asphalt costs are currently, should we expect that that whole $54 million is recouped at some point over the next, call it, four quarters to six quarters?","Tom Hill","Well, I think, the improvement -- the 15%. 20% that Suzanne talked about in other products, the -- you are right, the majority of that is in Asphalt. Looking back a little bit \u201818 was just a really tough year for us in the Asphalt product line. We had -- wet weather didn\u2019t help us but really we got caught with the cost of rapidly rising liquid cost which cost us over $50 million.","But with the new public funding coming through strong in Vulcan markets, we are expecting to see double-digit growth in volumes in \u201819. It\u2019s supported by backlogs and what we see bidding in highway lettings in \u201819 which is very strong.","We believe that the liquid prices should stabilize, are stabilizing and we think we will see some modest improvement in unit margins as we work through \u201819. Remember we have been -- we raised prices dramatically all the way through \u201818 so we are starting to catch that.","We are always behind the liquid price. We are starting to catch it now, and we should see much improved performance in the Asphalt product line in \u201819 over \u201818 driven by demand and price improvements and stabilization of pricing or cost in liquid AC.","Suzanne Wood","And I would just add to that in terms of the pricing, I -- in my remarks I had called out the fact that we had increased prices by about 6% in that Asphalt sector for the full year. But in the fourth quarter, we increased by about 7%, so you can see that that is on an accelerating trend as we are trying to catch up with those costs, the majority of which happened with big spikes in the second half of the year.","Mike Dahl","Got it. Okay. Thank you both very much and nice results.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Suzanne Wood","Hi. Good morning.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. I wanted to ask about the cost performance in Aggregates, you obviously had good fixed cost leverage and cost outs enough to offset rising prices, for example, diesel and other costs. As we look ahead into \u201819, should we look at the efforts in \u201818 as being more one-off efforts that might not be repeated or can you keep up the kind of pace of the cost outs in \u201819?","Tom Hill","Yeah. Look, Suzanne and I are very proud of our operating teams and their performance improving their operating disciplines in the fourth quarter and actually throughout 2018. As I mentioned in my remarks, they finished the year with a world-class safety performance, which is -- just speaks to the discipline in operating side of the business.","And they actually lowered their cost in the fourth quarter and the full year in the face of dramatically rising fuel costs and probably some pretty wet conditions. I\u2019d just say that\u2019s just a job well done and great momentum that we carry into \u201819.","As you guys know this operating discipline is a key part of our continuous quest to improve our unit margins. It\u2019s just part of that formula and the good news I would tell you is, I don\u2019t think our operators are done. I think they still have potential out there and I kind of know this that they are working hard to implement their 2019 execution plans, while they build on that \u201818 performance. So I just tell you, I am really pleased with our operators and encouraging them that we are not done that we will keep the momentum and improve on it in \u201819.","Suzanne Wood","And I will just add to that too. I mean when you think about our business, you can really drive it down to something pretty simple that sets us apart from others, perhaps, and that is our unit profitability.","Our main goal is to drive that unit profitability, that\u2019s something that isn\u2019t one year initiative, as Tom said. It\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s ongoing because you can\u2019t stand still with that. You have got to continue to move it forward and we have got three ways to do it, you focus on pricing, you focus on volume and then you focus on operating efficiencies, and the discipline and the accountability in each of the plans.","And like Tom, I am very proud of what we have accomplished here for the year and in particular for the last few months. I especially like focusing on the operational efficiencies and driving costs at the plant level because I call that self-help.","It\u2019s something that\u2019s within our control. It\u2019s not something that you are waiting for that could be impacted by a number of things, not least of which is weather. So, yes, that\u2019s an ongoing effort and it\u2019s something, I can tell you, we think about and talk about here every single week.","Nishu Sood","Got it. No. Appreciate the color there. Second question I just wanted to ask about the volume-price relationship. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a pretty well established relationship there and we are seeing it in effect, but as volumes are accelerating pricing is as well. My question is we have had a much choppier environment for Aggregates volumes growth over the last couple of years versus let\u2019s say earlier in the recovery. Does that affect the relationship between volume and pricing in any way, I mean, we have heard arguments from investors both ways, it might depress the relationship or it might enhance it. What are your thoughts on that, if there is any change from the choppiness?","Tom Hill","I think it\u2019s really the visibility to the future is what impacts price and so that people know that there is volume coming and jobs coming they can take risk on the jobs they are bidding at that point. And that\u2019s really important because as we move through the recovery, the public side moving up rapidly is much clear, those jobs are very public.","The DOTs, everybody knows within six to 12 months of what\u2019s going to let and how it\u2019s letting and those lettings are increasing dramatically in our markets. That does a whole lot to give our customers and entire segment visibility to what\u2019s coming to be able to risk price.","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. And I would just add to that with respect to the highway shipments, I mean, the timing might not always be precise and crystal clear on those, but the direction of travel certainly is. It\u2019s something that we and our customers and others in the space can get their minds around.","And I think that the sales folks here really did a good job in the early fall kind of setting the tone for price increases upcoming volumes by sending out price increase letters and talking to our customers really, really early on that.","Because that, if you have that conversation with your customers and everyone understands what the expectations are prior to our customers speaking to their customers and going down the chain, it just gives them the time to do what they need to do and it just creates a much better pricing environment and I think with the sequential and year-over-year pricing improvement that we saw Q3 and Q4, I think it really that was a good starting point for it.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Hill","Good morning Jerry. Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Hi. Good morning.","Jerry Revich","Really nice to see pricing cadence, it\u2019s not normal seasonality for pricing to really accelerate into the fourth quarter. So I am wondering, if you folks can expand on just the comments you made on the drivers of price acceleration into the fourth quarter of \u201818 and as I think about what \u201819 could look like as a result relative to the guide, the starting point is plus 5 and we have price increases coming over the course of \u201819. Seems like it\u2019s pretty easy to get toward the higher end of your guidance range for pricing if that\u2019s the cadence, I am wondering if you care to comment on that please.","Tom Hill","Yeah. I think that, first of all, I -- we are very pleased with the momentum and the pick-up. That\u2019s what we thought was going to happen in the second year and it just goes to our visibility as I spoke to earlier of the bid work and the backlog pricing and it\u2019s underscored with the fixed plant pricing that we saw in January and we will see in April.","We have done this before. We have seen it before. We have stepped up and it just over time in sequence. So I think we feel very good about it. Whereas this past year in \u201818, was very much back-half loaded. I think we will continue to grow prices as we go through \u201819. I don\u2019t think it will be as choppy as \u201818. I think it will be much smoother. But as we work off old work and we put new work on it will move up.","Now remember, the comps will get tougher as you go throughout the year also. But -- so I would always, I think, we will see the prices ease up as we go through the year. I just don\u2019t think it will be quite as choppy if \u201818, if I am answering your question.","Jerry Revich","Yeah. That\u2019s helpful, Tom. Thank you. And just to take a step back in the early phases of this recovery, you folks have certainly been leading the markets from a pricing standpoint and you have highlighted at your Analyst Day that that had come at the expense of some share. Are we at a point where your share you view as normalized and we are now back to the point where we could lead the market in pricing beyond \u201819, I guess it feels like you have got pretty good momentum heading into \u201820 and I just want to make sure I understand your view of the competitive landscape, as well as we exit \u201819 at a pretty healthy pricing clip.","Tom Hill","I think whether it\u2019s the competitive landscape or our customers, I think, what\u2019s really going to support pricing and I am kind of repeating myself is the visibility and the clarity to the growing public work and while we will see big growth in public demand in \u201819 and solid in private, \u201820 will be more public work and \u201821 will be the more public work.","Because remember in all of these states where we have seen increasing funding they have got to mature through the process and so the jobs and work are going to build as we are able to take those funds and put them to work and hopefully put them to shipments of stones. So that visibility and that growing demand was really what\u2019s going to support price increases throughout Vulcan-served markets.","Jerry Revich","Heading into \u201820?","Tom Hill","Yes. \u201820 and \u201821.","Jerry Revich","Perfect. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Schrier with Citi.","Suzanne Wood","Hi. Good morning Scott.","Scott Schrier","Hi. Good morning. I want to start off with a broad-based question on the guidance and understanding the components that go into it, volumes, price or incrementals. I am curious you have been talking about it in the past several months everybody has that we are going to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way we model weather in there that not every day is going to be a blue sky. So, with that in mind, if we have more normalized weather this year, does that mean we hit the midpoint of guidance straight and when I say normalized, I mean maybe a little bit less of the rain that we have had. Does that mean we hit the midpoint of that guidance or does that mean we are more at the high-end? I just want to see how you thought about that in the context of your guidance.","Tom Hill","You know, I think when we put the guidance together, we were thoughtful in our guidance about the weather impact knowing that the last couple of years we have seen wetter weather. I think if you look at the last two quarters, it gives me a lot of confidence in that guidance and I will give you two, three reasons why. One, the price increases continue to accelerate and we have got a lot of confidence in that.","Two our sales volumes in the fourth quarter were really strong in spite of wet weather and a little -- that being said, that tells me that the contractors have got big backlogs and they have got to get work done. When the sun comes out, they got to make hay and we saw some of them really execute on that in Q4.","And the third, as we talked about earlier, our operators executed with real discipline in the face of higher fuel costs and tough wet conditions in the fourth quarter and we will carry that forward.","So, as we look into \u201819, I think that guidance I think we were thoughtful about weather and maybe some other headwinds and what we have to do regardless of the outside forces to make sure that we make our guidance.","Scott Schrier","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to follow up earlier on the cost question, obviously, you had very strong results in the quarter, 75% incremental. It was a pretty easy comp, so you talked about the diesel and even with that you are up on a two to -- both at for two years and three years on your cash gross profit per ton understanding 5% like-for-like pricing obviously helps. I am just curious, in this particular quarter, is there anything else that we should consider whether there is any kind of inventory build or anything in there? And then, going forward into \u201819, should we be taking into account any consideration outside of normal trends for inventory builds or stripping costs or anything of that like?","Suzanne Wood","Yes. Sure. I will -- I will try to address just your first point on whether the comps were easier or not. I mean we have talked about a lot of the pressures that we had -- cost pressures we had this year and in particular in fourth quarter those continued.","Our diesel fuel pricing was actually or our diesel fuel costs were actually higher this year in fourth quarter than last year. We had, even though we didn\u2019t call them out, because we are trying to perhaps move away a bit from calling out some of these, what I consider to be sort of relatively small items unless it\u2019s material and unless it\u2019s trend-worthy.","So we didn\u2019t go through a detailed weather exercise in the fourth quarter. Although, I think for those of us who watch the weather channel obsessively it certainly was pretty wet in fourth quarter.","So I think again with $5 million more in diesel fuel with some disruption from rail where we had to truck items around quarter-over-quarter, I think, that that increase in EBITDA of $53 million was pretty real. I am not sure that I would necessarily consider that to be the easiest comp in the whole wide world.","You also raised the question on inventory in the fourth quarter and what we did with respect to that, and look, our inventory is based on production planning that we do every single week. We put together that production plan based on the demand picture that we see what is in our backlog and what we expect very near-term shipments to be.","And so, in the quarter we had a very slight inventory build, it was around 3 million tons or so, the delta between Q4 \u201817 and Q4 \u201818 and that had less than -- certainly less than a $10 million impact. It is mostly fixed cost that you are talking about. So pretty minor stuff with respect to that and again it was on the basis of what we expected those really near-term shipments to be and I am glad we did it. Tom, do you have anything to add?","Tom Hill","No. I think you covered that well. Thank you.","Scott Schrier","Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate all the detail and the color, and then, obviously, congrats on a strong finish to a challenging year and good luck.","Suzanne Wood","Okay. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today.","Suzanne Wood","Hi Kathryn.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Kathryn Thompson","Good morning. One is just a follow-up on California, and it really has to do more with conversations that we have had with a variety of different industry contacts in the state certainly are seeing a good flow of infrastructure projects, but leading into the November it\u2019s our impression that we are really now seeing more the benefits of local measures and haven\u2019t really seen the full effect of SB-1, would love to get your color on that commentary and your thoughts on the local measure versus seeing the SB-1 momentum right now. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Yeah. I think your question was, are we seeing the impact of SB-1 and the local measures or either, what\u2019s the question?","Kathryn Thompson","Are you seeing -- yeah. Are you seeing a greater impact of local measures right now and is there really more to come with SB-1, I mean...","Tom Hill","Yeah. So the answer to your question is, we are seeing both the impact of local measures and SB-1 and in those projects, there is some of the local measures that I named, the 30 projects that we backlogged and the 15 or 20 that we will bid in the next couple of months, so both of those -- both local measures and SB-1are flowing through.","I think the bigger impact right now that we have seen in the projects we backlogged has been SB-1. But remember there\u2019s $46 million of that is locals that are coming. So you are right to point out that they will really -- they will start to -- they will start to impact \u201819 though you have much bigger impact in \u201820 and 21 along with SB-1.","Kathryn Thompson","Perfect. Thank you. Just wanted to get an update on Aggregates USA integration and really focusing on what progress you are seeing with the revenue synergies that you had outlined previously really realistically would be fitting in \u201819 into \u201820, but if you could you just give an update on revenue synergy progress with Aggregates USA? Thank you.","Tom Hill","So you know first of all, we continue to be really, really happy with that acquisition. It\u2019s a great strategic fit between their distribution network, our distribution network, their quarries and our quarries and how we piece all of those pieces of the puzzle together.","Our execution has been very successful. We are actually ahead of the planned -- quite a bit ahead of the plan on unit margins. We had -- as you know, we had some rail service issues that we experienced in \u201818 that hurt us, but we think we put most of that behind us and as we look at Ag USA, we think \u201819 is shaping up to be a very good year to take full advantage of the synergies between all those operations.","Kathryn Thompson","Great. Thank you so much.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Garik Shmois with Longbow.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Garik.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning, Garik.","Garik Shmois","Hi. Good morning. Congratulation on the quarter.","Tom Hill","Thanks.","Garik Shmois","Yeah. I just want to nitpick a little bit on the volume guidance of 3% to 5%. It is a little bit less than the 6% same store volumes that you put up in 2018. So I just kind of want of reconcile some of the bullishness that you are expressing particularly on the public side versus the expected volume growth in 2019. Just wondering -- I know you had some large project shipments in I think Illinois, Arizona, just wondering if there\u2019s maybe some timing issues that might be weighing on the potential growth in 2019 or if there is any labor constraints or anything else that you might be able to call out that is underpinning the guidance?","Tom Hill","As I have talked about in the range, I think, we try to be very thoughtful as we went into \u201819 about both weather -- maybe wetter weather or weather issues, also as you just called out, very thoughtful on the timing of large projects. So -- and so that we wouldn\u2019t maybe have to have those big swings.","But I think that we are confident in that guidance. We feel good about it. The private side continues to be healthy. We see growth across our footprint in the private side and the public side, as we said, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s our best estimate, educated estimate of the timing of those projects with new funding. As always, that can accelerate or slip and so that would be the delta in the range and also, like I said, we have had wet weather for the last two years and we try to be thoughtful about that also.","Garik Shmois","Okay, understood. And just a follow-up, just on volumes and just the cadences as you expect it to progress over the course of the year, understanding you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance. But you do have some tougher comparisons in the middle of the year. So just wondering if maybe you can maybe help us with expectations on how the volumes are expected to progress.","Tom Hill","I don\u2019t see \u201819 as a cadence any different from any other year. The first quarter is always just dicey and so weather dependent. Second quarter we start to build as the construction season comes on. Third quarter is usually the strongest quarter, obviously, we have gotten blown up a few -- for the last couple of years with hurricanes. But we -- and then the fourth quarter again can be very good if you carry weather forward.","So I wouldn\u2019t see the changing any at all, and I think, we have got backlogs of good solid both public and private jobs, some of which are large -- some of which are large and we are already shipping. So I think that we may have a little bit better clarity on the timing of large projects than maybe we had in \u201817 or \u201818, but the cadence through the year of shipments, I wouldn\u2019t expect any big changes to it.","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. I will just add to that. I agree with what Tom said as part of coming in relatively new here. One of the things that I spent time looking at is really how -- I looked at it not just on a revenues basis but also from an EBITDA basis in terms of what is the phasing during the year.","You are right, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but I found it interesting that if you go back for a three year historical period or a five year historical period and you sort of look at how these things -- how our business phases by quarter. It\u2019s actually a much more narrow band than you might think it is. So I would encourage you to go back and just have a look at it in that historical way. Yes, there will always be some puts and takes between quarters but it\u2019s a bit tighter than you might think.","Garik Shmois","Okay. We will do that. Thanks again and best of luck.","Suzanne Wood","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Hey guys.","Suzanne Wood","Hi. Good morning, Phil.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Phil Ng","Good morning. You are expecting a pretty noticeable uptick in pricing for your Aggregates business. But if pricing falls let\u2019s say a little short, closer to the lower end of the range that you have highlighted. Do you have enough levers on the efficiency front to kind of deliver your 60% incremental margin target?","Tom Hill","Short answer to your question is yes. And I feel a lot more confident about that based on the performance of our operators and their improvement in efficiencies in the second half of 2018. They worked very hard on focusing on those efficiencies, particularly in our larger operations and now we are carrying it through all of our operations as we head into \u201819.","So I think we feel very confident that our cost will pull-through no matter -- that our costs will come in as expected, no matter what gets thrown at us, and quite candidly that\u2019s what our operators will tell you their job is.","Phil Ng","Okay. That\u2019s excellent. And I guess, when you think about government shutdown risk, that\u2019s obviously dissipating right now, but how do you think about the prospect that the two parties come together and get an infrastructure bill negotiated this year and what\u2019s the risk that projects get delayed on the public side next year with funding winding down on the federal side by 2020 if no new bill gets passed? Thanks.","Tom Hill","The short answer is shutdown was really no impact. We had a few states that pushed jobs back about a few months into later lettings, but really no impact on us, and as you know, the Feds already distributed the funding for \u201819.","On the federal highway bill what we know this, is that House T&I Chairman Peter DeFazio is working hard on an infrastructure bill. DeFazio wants to solve the Highway Trust Fund issue. We for sure want to support him in that and our country needs that. So the need is there, both parties want this to happen. But I wouldn\u2019t venture to guess what\u2019s going to happen with that yet.","Now if -- as we go into \u201820 and we have seen -- I don\u2019t see any pushback or problems with the FAST Act in \u201820. If you get to the end of it, it runs out, the Feds are not going to let funding go down they are not going to let it to be unfunded. Now that gives some -- I believe in \u201821 that will give some -- maybe some short-term views for problems for DOTs.","But remember you also have massive state and local funding improvements and as we called out in the prepared remarks, the federal highway bill is $45 million. That\u2019s not going to go away, but in our markets -- per year, but in our markets, $45 billion, excuse me, but in our markets you have an improvement of another $20 billion per year that\u2019s just now starting to flow through in increase.","So I am always worried about the Highway Trust Fund. It\u2019s something we work hard on. It\u2019s something everybody needs. But I think we will be fine as long as our federal government works hard to fix that problem and it may take some time and some effort to fix, but I believe it will be fixed.","Phil Ng","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Suzanne Wood","Hi. Good morning.","Stanley Elliott","Good morning guys. Thank you all for fitting me in. Quick question, when you talk about the CapEx piece and you mentioned kind of the extra $200 million of growth CapEx. How long do you foresee that -- the plans, I guess, on a go-forward basis, because at some point, right? I mean you are going to be close to the low end of your leverage target by the end of this year. Certainly by next year for sure and depending upon kind of that swing flex piece on the CapEx side, it could leave you guys in a pretty interesting situation?","Suzanne Wood","No. That\u2019s right and good for you for getting to that math quickly. You are right. If you run that through we will be well within that that 2 times to 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA debt band that we always talk about or leverage brand.","I think it\u2019s management\u2019s responsibility to make sure that we have a good balance sheet structure and we have a responsible, somewhat conservative leverage target. I believe we absolutely have those in place. I think it\u2019s also our responsibility to create as much flexibility and optionality as we can for the company and I think being well within that leverage target certainly gets us there.","If we find ourselves approaching the low end of the leverage band or even outside it, as we go forward, what we would, I mean, we will go back to our capital allocation priorities. I mean that\u2019s really why we have those in place and there is a priority waterfall to them which is investing in our same-store growth.","It is the least risky and it is the most profitable for us. Then we look to internal growth projects that are high returning. Then we potentially look to M& A being very disciplined in our approach to that. It\u2019s got to be strategic and it\u2019s got to add value to the company and have a high return and failing that then we have the opportunity to return excess cash to shareholders.","So I think our view now is that we want to set ourselves up to have that flexibility and optionality with the cash and as we begin to approach that point, I am sure at the board level, we will have -- be having discussions about exactly how to invest that cash and how to distribute it in such a way that we will drive shareholder value and so I would characterize it as a quality problem to have.","Stanley Elliott","Yeah. No doubt. And then last one, do we still think about kind of the business kind of the 255 million tons kind of a mid-cycle number or normalized number that equates to $8.25 cash gross profit per ton or have those numbers changed either through internal efficiencies, better logistics, a larger footprint, anything like that would be helpful.","Tom Hill","Fundamentally, we still think about it the same way. I think if you would ask us five years ago, where are you on that curve, I would tell you a tale of two different answers. One I think we would have thought that some of the public would have come on earlier and we may be a little ahead, we would have been a little bit ahead of volume. If you look to unit margins, based on where we are with these volumes, we are ahead of the curve I think and moving up rapidly. So, but fundamentally the answer to your question is yes that\u2019s still the way we look at it.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. Thank you. Appreciate it. Best of luck.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","Thanks guys.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","Good morning and congrats on a great Q4.","Tom Hill","Thank you, Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","I wanted to zero in on the M&A pipeline first, Tom, do you think this is a good environment, I mean the privates want to sell right now and then are you seeing large companies for sale small companies for sale or both?","Tom Hill","I don\u2019t -- the timing of that is always you got to watch whatever comes up when it comes up and you can\u2019t control the timing of M&A projects. There are some buzzers around out there. We are always looking at those. But it goes back to our simple answer which is discipline, choose the markets you want to be in, what are the synergies that are unique to Vulcan, what can we do with it, make sure you buy it at a price that is reasonable and once you get it, make sure you integrate it effectively, efficiently and fast. So we are always looking, there is always something bubbling out there, but the timing of that and the disciplines are key.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. And then also wanted to ask you about the Texas Gulf Coast, you mentioned that quickly, but can you give us some additional color on what you are seeing there and what impact that could have on your business in \u201819 and \u201820?","Tom Hill","Yeah. So Houston really saw a downturn in \u201817 -- kind of late \u201816 early into \u201817. It has rebounded both on the public side, and then in Texas you also got added to that massive funding in highway projects throughout Texas, many of those are along the Gulf Coast, including the best part in Houston. So economy and demand in Gulf Coast and in Houston will be very healthy we think in \u201819 and \u201820 driven by both the public side and the private side.","Now there are also along the Gulf Coast both in Texas and Louisiana there\u2019s a lot of projects in the pipeline at various stages of development from an energy perspective, particularly LNG and refinery expansion.","We are tracking 10 of those projects right now in Louisiana and Texas. It\u2019s a little early predict for \u201819 when -- at where we are in \u201819, when those projects will ship. Now these tend to be very large, very fast projects that are right in our wheelhouse because of our unique Blue Water capability and the massive delivery you can do in one swath with those 60,000 tons ships.","We believe we will see a lot of these projects start in the next two to three years. We may see a little bit of that in volume at the end of the second half of \u201819, but I wouldn\u2019t make a call on that at this point.","But it\u2019s in the pipeline and we will follow it and we think they are going to go but the timing and that\u2019s permeating in all those kinds of things we just wait and see, but good stuff to come along the Louisiana and Texas Coast.","Adam Thalhimer","Perfect. Thanks Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Great. Thanks.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Tom Hill","Hi, Brent.","Brent Thielman","Good morning. May be back on the growth CapEx, if you sort of look at the slate of other internal things you could be doing over the next 12 months. I am curious sort of the sensitivity to that estimate for the year, could it be far too modest if you just pull a trigger on a few of those items, call it, prospective kind of near-term investments?","Suzanne Wood","Yeah. No. It\u2019s a very good question, I mean, again, we went through that thoughtfully, we went sort of project-by-project talking about the ones we might kick off in \u201819. Although, I will tell you a lot of the money set aside for \u201819 is really to finish off projects that were begun in \u201817 and \u201818 because some of those are sort of what I will call long lived projects, particularly as it relates to opening new quarries in markets that are going to be really important to us like California, South Carolina and Texas.","So we have put together what we think is an appropriate level of guidance in spending $200 million, we will look at if other projects are brought to us to look at that we think might be incredibly meaningful and returns enhancing to the customer, I mean, to our company then we will certainly consider that and we will keep you updated on that as we go forward through the quarter, but we are pretty comfortable with the $200 million that we have given at this point for \u201819.","Tom Hill","Yeah. I\u2019d add to that that remember these -- the greenfield projects are some of our highest returns. They are like an -- they take a long time to do. They are very expensive to get permitted and get up and take years, but once you get them, it\u2019s decades and decades long quarry. They look like an acquisition without paying the blue sky. They also take a little longer to ramp up, but once you get one of those quarries developed, the returns are quite enhancing.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe a follow-up back on Asphalt, I think, Suzanne, you mentioned sort of this gradual impact of offsetting the higher liquid asphalt costs as you go through these contracts. This isn\u2019t -- you guys have been through this many times before obviously. But would 2019 look any different than past cycles where you have seen these costs fluctuate maybe because of jobs you are working on are larger than usual?","Tom Hill","I wouldn\u2019t think they look a lot different from past cycles. I have seen too many of these to count I think. But I wouldn\u2019t say you look a lot different than other cycles. The big question is, we have seen liquids stabilize. We think it will maybe stay at where it is or maybe come up a little bit in the year, but not the big spike in ramp up that we saw through \u201818 and in doing that you will have that time which we are already catching up on to raise prices and get that material margin where it ought to be.","I think we are already seeing that. I believe that based on our hot mix prices and our liquid prices, but I\u2019d also tell you, the first quarter is a tough barometer there because the Asphalt business is just tough in the first quarter. The weather keeps just cold and wet so it keeps just -- so the tale of that will be how do we -- how does that come across in Q2 and we will have obviously better visibility of that when we get to the end of the first quarter.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.","Tom Hill","Thank you. Suzanne and I are very proud of the performance our operators and our teams did in the fourth quarter and the second half of \u201818.

Aggregates pricing continue to march higher. This coupled with our disciplined cost control resulted in same-store unit profitability increasing 8% to $5.45 per ton.","We achieved a 15% same-store increase in gross profit, while delivering same-store flow-through of incremental Aggregates revenue of 65%. The extreme bad weather we experienced was and is a short-term disruption. These disruptions have had no long-term impact on underlying demand, on pricing dynamics, or on flow-through of incremental revenue to gross profit. The third quarter bodes well for the future. Prices continue to escalate. With improved flow-throughs, all of which is supported by growing demand.","Total revenues increased by 13%, reflecting growth in Aggregates volumes and Aggregates selling prices. All of this contribute to a 65% increase in net earnings and a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA. We obviously had extreme wet weather from \u2013 and flooding in the Carolinas and Virginia from Hurricane Florence and Tropical Storm Gordon caused record rain days in Dallas and San Antonio. We believe the severe weather negatively affected third quarter results with a loss of some 2.5 million tons of Aggregates and related flooding costs. We estimate that the pre-tax loss due to weather to be approximately $27 million in the quarter.","Now, I'd like to move on to the core drivers of profitability in the business, ex-weather. We continue to see growth in private demand, but we're really excited about the strengthening public sector. Highway construction demand is strengthening across the country, but much more so in our markets. We're now seeing the conversion of public funding in the shipments, and this showed up in 10% growth in our quarterly Aggregates shipments and a 6% on a same-store basis.","While these are strong growth numbers, they're particularly strong given the severe weather we experienced. However, we are still below normalized demand levels, much less the next peak. As we've said all along this year, price increases will continue to climb throughout the year and throughout 2019. Average selling prices in the quarter, adjusted for mix, rose more than 3% on a year-over-year basis, and approximately 50 basis points over the second quarter.","As we look at our booking pace and backlogs, we will continue to see good upward trends in pricing. Our discussions with customers on price increases for 2019 are encouraging. Our preliminary view is that the pricing will improve mid-single-digit in 2019, reflecting the positive momentum we're seeing today.","Turning to same-store cost and flow-throughs, our freight-adjusted unit cost per sales declined 2%. This cost leverage and other operating efficiencies more than offset a 28% increase in diesel fuel and operating inefficiencies caused by bad weather. Again, we're very pleased with the way our operating discipline has enabled solid improvement in unit gross profit, despite difficult conditions.","Regarding outlook for the fourth quarter, we would expect three things; one, shipment growth similar to that of the third quarter; two, prices to continue improving; and three, we expect the operating disciplines you saw in the third quarter to continue, allowing for over 60% flow-through, consistent with our long-term trends.","Given what we accomplished in the third quarter and how things are going in the fourth quarter, we've set ourselves up well for 2019, and here is why. I am pleased with underlying demand growth and corresponding volume growth, driven by growing public demand in our markets. And as we approach 2019, our DOTs continue to pull tax revenues into job starts, which is translating into Aggregates shipments.","Our backlogs and booking pace continue to grow. The fact that pricing and our backlog and bookings continues to increase along with positive 2019 fixed plant pricing conversations, gives us confidence in the continued accelerating pricing trends into 2019. The progress we made in our operating cost execution also reinforces our confidence in realizing continuous compounding improvements in unit margin, and 60% flow-throughs in 2019 and beyond.","And now, I'll turn it over to Suzanne for a more detailed review of the numbers. Suzanne?","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Let me begin by saying that I am delighted to be part of the Vulcan team. In the eight weeks that I've been on board, it's clear to me that this is a great company, a market leader with strong culture and business model. I look forward to working with Tom and others as we continue to improve our business and to sharing that progress with you.","Today I'd like to cover several topics starting with an overview of third quarter results. You've heard some of the highlights from Tom, but I think a few are important enough to reemphasize. Next, I'll touch on our Aggregates flow-through of incremental revenue to gross profit and that improving trend. Third, I'll review our full-year outlook, as well as share some preliminary thoughts on 2019. And finally, I'll give a quick update on our strong balance sheet, cash flow generation, and capital allocation priorities.","Now, as Tom mentioned, despite the challenges of the quarter, we realized double-digit growth in earnings. Our Aggregates shipment volume, average selling price, flow-through rate, and unit profitability improved. Shipments of Aggregates were strong in many of our key markets, and our mix-adjusted price improved both year-over-year and sequentially. Our strong same-store Aggregates flow-through rate in the quarter helped to drive gross profit per ton higher.","These results demonstrate the strength of our Aggregates-focused business, even when we experienced cost pressures and wet weather. And unlike most industrial businesses, our main raw material is the rock in the ground, which is unaffected by inflation.","Our operating leverage and efficiencies drive profitability by helping to offset cost pressures like diesel fuel. For example, during our third quarter, our unit cost of diesel fuel rose by 28% compared to the prior year and impacted the results by $8 million. Despite this, same-store unit cost of sales for Aggregates declined by 2%, and unit profitability increased by 8%.","Now, with respect to bad weather, as Tom stated earlier, we estimate that this quarter's results were negatively affected by approximately $27 million on a pre-tax basis. As a reminder, we had about $30 million of storm-related costs in last year's third quarter. Since the impact from weather in the comparative quarters is broadly similar, the effect on this year's flow-through is not particularly significant.","Our same-store flow-through target is 60% on a trailing 12-month basis. It was therefore pleasing to see our year-to-date same-store flow-through rate move up to 52%, another step in the right direction toward our goal. Given the underlying and ongoing improvement in our business, we expect continuing margin growth and unit margin improvement.","We remain keenly focused on the cost control efficiencies and operating leverage that drive this flow-through number. While there are a number of things in our business that we can't control like weather, diesel prices, or the exact timing of when a large highway project starts, we can control our costs and we can drive our per-ton margin metrics higher.","The next topic I'll touch on relates to our 2018 outlook and some preliminary thoughts for 2019. First, 2018, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion. In our core segment, Aggregates, same-store volume growth in the fourth quarter should be similar to the level of increase experienced in the third quarter. Additionally, as Tom emphasized, there will be upward movement in pricing. Aggregates' unit profitability will continue to improve.","Moving on to the Asphalt segment, we now expect full-year gross profit to be $25 million lower than the prior year as a result of liquid asphalt prices, which rose sharply again in the third quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. Average selling prices in the Asphalt segment are moving up, but will only partially offset the impact of more expensive liquid asphalt for the balance of the year.","Our full-year expectation of profitability for the Concrete segment remains unchanged. And finally, the outlook for other major expense lines such as SAG expense, interest expense and DD&A expense remains unchanged.","After further review of our 2018 capital spending plans, we now anticipate that operating and maintenance capital expenditure will be $225 million rather than $250 million. Our growth CapEx will reduce from $350 million to $300 million. These capital spending reductions are part of our ongoing view to reevaluate the merits and timing of the individual projects. Using these assumptions, we now expect our 2018 after-tax cash flow from earnings to be approximately $810 million.","Moving on to 2019, please keep in mind that we are in the midst of our planning and budgeting process. As we have in the past, we'll provide more specific guidance when we report fourth quarter earnings, but for today, felt it would be appropriate to share some early thoughts.","Tom has already commented on the attractive public and private demand picture and we anticipate mid-single digit growth in both Aggregates volume and pricing. Our views here are supported by what we're seeing both in backlogs and the pace at which we are booking new business.","In conclusion, I'll address our balance sheet strength and capital allocation priorities. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, strong balance sheet structure, and debt leverage between 2 times and 2.5 times EBITDA. Currently, our weighted average debt maturity is 16 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 4.5%. This debt profile, together with our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to sensibly manage our business. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged, and we will be disciplined in the use of that capital, always seeking to improve our returns and shareholder value.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Suzanne. I'm proud of our peoples' performance in the third quarter. They delivered impressive results under tough circumstances. We continued our sharp focus on all aspects of operational excellence, including our safety performance where our year-to-date injury rate is 0.91 per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is world-class. In the third quarter, we made solid progress toward our longer-term goals. And as we look to 2019, we're confident that we will continue to gain momentum in compounding improving price increases, and in our operating disciplines that drive cost improvements, both of which continue to grow unit margins.","Now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will first hear from Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Tom and Suzanne.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Trey.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","A quick question on the price acceleration that you've been seeing. I mean, you guys have been calling for that for most of the year. And here we're starting to see that come through and it sounds like that's going to continue into 2019. Can you just kind of talk about some of the drivers you're seeing there that's behind some of that acceleration?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. If you step back and look at our pricing momentum in our business, it's clearly improving. We like the continued growth that we're seeing in price increases. Now, we expect, as we talked about in the \u2013 all through the year, we expect pricing increases to continue to step up quarter-over-quarter. And you saw that between Q2 and Q3, and it's really \u2013 that's really the basis of that is the continued improvement on price increases on bid work. We can see it in our backlogs. We see it in our booking paces. And as you kind of go through the individual markets, you can watch it just inch up week-over-week, month-over-month.","Now, Trey, we'll see a bigger jump in January, as most of our price increases for fixed plant work go into effect at that point. Those conversations are happening as we speak with those fixed plant customers for 2019. We're very encouraged by those conversations. The preliminary view, as we said, would be mid-single digit. Obviously, we'll give you a lot more clarity of that in February, but underpinning all of this, and we talk about this a lot, is a visibility to big and more and more public work that's coming. We're starting to ship a lot of those jobs, so people are feeling good and have confidence in the market. They have good visibility. Diesel prices and logistics costs, we're starting to overcome those and that just widens our moat. So, as we step back and look at it, our price increases are clearly moving up.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks for that, Tom, that's helpful. And then you're looking for volume and, it sounds like, demand trends in 4Q to look similar to 3Q. Can you give us any ideas what you guys are seeing specifically in October with that at least coming close to a close here?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. I would tell you that the momentum we have had in Q3 is carrying right into Q4. I'll say it right up front, we try to be thoughtful about how many shipping days are available in Q4 to make up the postponed work from the weather in Q3. Texas continued to be wet all through October. But when the sun came out in Texas, we've shipped strong. Now the rest of the country has been very strong and it just underpins the strength of our underlying demand in our markets. When we got dry weather, we're shipping. Prices on bid work continue to move up. I think the operations execution we saw in Q3 clearly carried into October. So, we should see not only that volume momentum go into Q4, we should also carry that unit margin improvement momentum into Q4. And this really sets us up good for 2019 kind of along all those disciplines.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll just add a couple of comments to that on Q4. You're right, the guidance does imply an uplift of about 22% year-over-year, and obviously that's going to be driven by the things that Tom mentioned. When we looked at the volume in the quarter, it's about in line with what we experienced in the third quarter in terms of sort of 6% same-store volume in the Aggregates segment. We've got the gradual step-up in price, and we've also \u2013 we are assuming that flow-throughs will be good and unit profitability will improve.","As Tom said, I think the keyword here is thoughtful. We're sitting here at the end of October talking about guidance for the full year and giving some preliminary view to next year, so we tried to really be thoughtful about the guidance we were given. We've got pretty much of October behind us. We only have one more day to go. So, any of the trends that we saw strength across the country, perhaps a little bit of wetness in Texas early in the quarter, we \u2013 or early in the month, we have already factored that into the guidance.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that color, Suzanne. That was good. And then lastly for me and I'll pass it on is, you mentioned, Suzanne, capital spending, operating and maintenance CapEx dialing that back a little bit from $250 million to $225 million, and I think growth from $350 million to $300 million. And do you have any preliminary view, and I know there was some commentary, maybe a quarter or two ago, but just any update on how to think about those two pieces of CapEx as we look into 2019?","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Not really. I mean, we are still in the early stages of our planning and budgeting. I guess if I had to say something on a very, very preliminary basis, it would be in terms of the operating and maintenance side. That will probably be relatively in line with what you will have seen us spend this year with respect to growth CapEx. And actually \u2013 we're actually having a big roundtable discussion about that here next week, so I think it would be a little bit preliminary to give you a guide on that, other than to say that as we had indicated, we had a number of projects on line for growth spending this year. And if I had to give you a directional comment one way or the other, I would not expect it to be quite as high next year, but we'll firm that up when we give fourth quarter guidance. Does that help?","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks a lot, Suzanne. Thanks, Tom, and I'll pass it on. Look forward to seeing you guys next week.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Great.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Jerry.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and Suzanne, welcome.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I wonder, Suzanne, I'd love to hear as you step up into your new role, can you just talk about the strategic priorities that you see for the organization over the next 12 months? I guess, how should we think about the opportunity set relative to the items that you're most focused on over the next year?","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, absolutely. That's a fair question and I'll try to give you a couple of examples of that. I mean, first and foremost, our strategic focus needs to be on improving our business, and when I say that to be specific that means improving our unit profitability. So all the actions you see us take with respect to pricing improvements, with respect to improving efficiencies across all of our plants with respect to any other initiatives we put in place, it's all around driving that unit profitability.","And in addition to that, making sure that when we are deploying our capital, we are doing it in a very disciplined and thoughtful way to drive an appropriate return on that. So, really getting sort of into things with operations. It's something I love doing and I plan on working hard to try to help the field identify some of those unit profitability improvements and getting those into place.","And then in addition to that, just making sure that all of that hard work converts into a good cash flow stream, I think is key. So, those are the priorities. I hope that's helpful and I look forward to updating you on those and talking about those as we go through the year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure. I appreciate it. And then in terms of \u2013 as you look across the business performance in the quarter, really strong organic growth despite the storms. Can you just give us a flavor for the breadth of disparity in markets that you're seeing, what the low end of the growth curve look like and are there any significant outliers on the high end that are contributing to the strong shipment growth on an organic basis?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll take a shot at that. We talked a little bit about that in the geographic mix and price. And so we saw big shipments on large, particularly public work jobs in Arizona, Alabama and Illinois. We would take those jobs every day but they are at lower prices and therefore lower corresponding unit margins. At the same time, we got hit a little bit with weather in Virginia and in North Carolina, which are both higher price and higher margin. So all that mix was in there, but you're going to have mix at any time in this, I think.","But if you look across our footprint, Jerry, we're seeing prices go up pretty much across our footprint. I think in the third quarter, I was very pleased with the breadth of operating improvements and kind of everybody's unit margin improving. And to make this thing happen, you want the whole group to go up at the same time and just move everything up a notch. And you've seen us do this before. And I think you saw the beginning of that in Q3 and we look \u2013 I think we're taking that right into Q4 and 2019.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Tom, you folks have been prudent in assuming SB1 as part of the business outlook in California until the money starts being spent. If SB1 stays in the mix after Election Day, what sort of magnitude of upside should we be thinking about to the preliminary volume guidance that you folks are laying out here?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, as you know, that's more than a doubling effect of funding in California for highway funding is what SB1 is. We're already seeing \u2013 that work is already being lapped. We won't see any those of jobs this year. But we'll see a fair amount of that flow through in 2019, both in Aggregates and in Asphalt. I'll remind you, we have the leading positions in both product lines. But I'll just address SB1 if you want me to.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Please.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","We're really encouraged by the support we see at SB1. There is an enormous effort to defeat Prop 6 in California. And if you watch the World Series, you even saw TV ads for defeating Prop 6 in California. People in California want their roads fixed and they're tired of it. Ironically, there's 15 local ballot initiatives in California on \u2013 right now in November for increasing infrastructure funding.","So, supporting SB1 is just the right thing to do. Remember, we've already collected almost $5 billion in taxes that will flow through in 2019 and 2020. On top of that, there's another $1.5 billion per year in local funding. So, as you've heard us say before, California is growing. It's going to grow with or without SB1. SB1 is the right thing to do, and we're very encouraged by the support we've seen from Californians for SB1.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And Tom just to clarify, so if the repeal effort is defeated, that would be a significant tailwind. In other words, it's not already assumed in your guidance. Correct?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we will hear from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Glad you provided outlook.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, and welcome Suzanne, looking forward to working with you.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you. You as well.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Glad you provided \u2013 yeah. Appreciate the outlook on pricing and volumes for 2019. Can you kind of provide some color on the buildup of how you're thinking about public versus private, and could you see some upside in some of this pen-up demand given the weather drag you've seen this year?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. So, I think I would characterize that as solid, private very much growing public, and the public is really driven by highway funding, which we have a lot of visibility to. And we're just starting to touch the tip of the iceberg on flow through of all that funding, because remember it always takes two years for it to flow through. So, the demand we see is really public driven. But if you'll allow me to, I'd like to just kind of cover 2019 while we're on it.","If we step back and look at it from a broad point-of-view, remember we're still \u2013 as I said earlier, we're still in the \u2013 we have long way to go to normalized demand much less peak, particularly with this much public funding coming on. We gave you mid-single digit price and volume. The business performance in Q3 gives us a lot of momentum going into Q4 and into 2019. Backlogs are at much higher levels and at higher prices, so is our booking pace. As we said earlier, the conversations on fixed plant increases for January of 2019 have gone very well. And I would summarize it to say that our \u2013 you're really seeing our profit engine start to accelerate.","I would \u2013 kind of to Suzanne's point about strategy, I'd point to four key factors. One, our markets are going to grow faster than the rest of the country really because of our geographic advantage, but also our customer service and what we're \u2013 our visibility to backlogs and very large jobs that are booked are coming. Second point is, as Suzanne said, we expect to deliver expanding unit margins with good flow-throughs, drivers which will be, A, compounding price improvements; B, operating leverage with higher volumes; and C, our operating efficiencies that you saw in Q3.","Third one, as you talked about, conversion of earnings into cash flows. And the fourth one was our disciplined approach to capital deployment. We're really focused on getting the full value out of our acquisitions and capturing the synergies that are available. We'll come back with guidance in February and a lot clearer view from your volume perspective, as we get kind of through the fourth quarter we got a better view of where these projects stand, particularly large highway projects and large non-res projects. And so, we'll just have a clearer picture at that point. But this is, our core structure's clear and it's really the same model you've seen from us deliver before.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll add just a little bit to that as well. I mean, coming in new, I try to look at it from what are we hearing on the macro front. We look at some of the same drivers that all of you on the call do, the ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index and various other measurement points. I would call your attention to one slide that is in the supplemental information we prepared. It comes from Dodge Analytics. I'm a big \u2013 I'm impressed with the information they provide having used it a lot in my past life.","But on page eight in the slide deck, it shows the year-over-year change in trailing 12 months in terms of highway award dollars, and it separates that into what that picture of improvement looks like in the markets that we serve versus all the other markets. And as Tom mentioned, in the markets we serve, there is a significant increase in highway award dollars there. So where we are geographically does help us quite a bit from the macro perspective. And I think that we have many touch points on the ground, our plant managers, our sales people, other employees, our customers and so we want to make sure that we listen to what they're telling us.","I think that as a complement to the macro data, you can't overlook what you're hearing on the ground and that provides you with a lot of intelligence as well. And so we're getting good indicators from those people as well. So, what we have heard on the ground isn't inconsistent in any way with macro.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","That's really helpful color. I mean, I think your stock is unfairly being kind of being beat up a bit on housing concerns. So Tom, if there is a view out there that hasn't moved sideways and just given the backlog and visibility you have on public, how do you think about growth the next years? I mean, how confident you are in terms of kind of sustaining that mid-single digit run rate the next few years in light of maybe some softening on the private side of things?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","So let's back up Q3, we saw that momentum. Q4, we're in October. We're seeing that growth momentum. I would describe the private side as solid. I would describe the public side is growing, and we're turning those rapidly-growing public funding and Aggregates shipments now, which we've been waiting for a while. But if you look at states like Georgia, Texas, South Carolina Tennessee, California, just to name a few, there's big, big public demand growth. So I think if we step back and let's put it in a little different perspective. If you look at nine of our states, which constitute over 80% of our revenues, the highway funding and local initiative funding in those states is up $20 billion per year. And most of those shipments haven't hit us yet.","We haven't converted those tax revenues into shipments. And if you put that on a \u2013 compared to a federal bill, that would be an increase of almost 50% in a federal bill in just nine states. So that's a sea change in public funding and it's just now starting to flow through, so it'll flow through, it'll continue to increase in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. But this is a big deal and it underpins our confidence in the markets and the demand in those markets.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","That's really helpful. And just one last one for me. Some of the mix headwinds you called out in 3Q, do you expect some of that dissipating in the fourth quarter, and how should we think about mix going into 2019? And, obviously, early in the year you called out some lag between pricing for ship and quoted pricing. Is that kind of largely behind you at this point? Thanks a lot.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll take big jobs in any market I got any time. I think what we \u2013 what you're seeing though is with good weather in Virginia and North Carolina in October, we've shipped very well. So those are not a matter of I don't want to see a decrease in shipments in Alabama, Arizona or Illinois, but I think you're starting to see that volume, that pent-up demand ship in places like North Carolina and Virginia even Georgia.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, I wanted to ask you a question around the 2019 guide and more conceptually around kind of how you're approaching things relating to obviously last year having some major storm impacts, this year having some major storm impacts. As you're looking at the guide for 2019, what are you taking into account as far as weather? Is it status quo, which will be kind of the new normal in terms of you're going to have some extreme weather year-to-year, or is there some different way that you're thinking about it looking into next year?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","How do you know the conversations we're having right now? Actually, we're just working through that, and that's a great question and one that, if you look at the mid-single digit volume, I would tell you we have solid confidence in that. How we vary from that will be timing of \u2013 as I said earlier, timing of large jobs. We've still got to step back and look at weather effect and how that works, which is extremely hard to do, but we'll get through it. And I think we'll give you a much clearer answer in February. I'm not trying to dodge your question, but that work is going on as we speak.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, the second question, I guess just more of a clarification around how some of the affected regions have progressed over the course of September and October. Are there any areas where you're still seeing facilities that are unable to ship into \u2013 or either unable to ship or unable to ship into major regions or \u2013 for the most part, I know you called out Texas as still being an issue, but have things returned to kind of pre-storm activity?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","That's a great question. The characteristics of the storms this year are quite different from last year. We don't see the lingering impacts that we saw and \u2013 both in shipments and in cost in general. Now, as you called out, wet weather in Texas has been an issue. I'd also tell you when the sun shines in Texas, we're shipping very strong. We've still got pumps (38:19) pumping lower levels, but we're operating all of our facilities. I don't think we have any facilities that aren't back up and running. So, I would call us in good shape on the East Coast. I'd say we're very healthy in Texas. When it quits raining every day, we ship. So, I don't see any lingering effects like we saw a year ago.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure.","Operator","And next we will hear from Stanley Elliot with Stifel.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Stanley.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thank you guys for fitting me in and welcome, Suzanne. A quick question. When you think about \u2013 I guess, one, could you help us with how inventories are out in the field, how balanced are you guys heading into next year? And then maybe kind of take that and as we're looking at maybe higher public spend market or public spend environment next year, does that end up making it easier to balance inventories or is there not much of a difference?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, first of all, I think we were pretty disciplined in the downturn. And I think we've been very disciplined over the last four or five years in making sure where we had inventories that were long, i.e., fines or base, that we cut into those and I think we're in much better shape. Always you have sizes that times get short, particularly Asphalt, and I think we've done a good job maximizing our efficiencies in our plant, which affects cost but also inventory.","So, as we stand right now, I think we're in great shape on inventories, not too much, not too little, and the right amount. I think that our planning process and our coordination has gotten better, and we've honed that in the return back to better shipments. So, I think we're going in a great shape. I think our plants and our facilities have a lot of flexibility to move up or down and be nimble with adjusting demand whether that's fundamental or timing of jobs or weather, and I think we've actually gotten better at that. And obviously, we've had good practice with weather over the last couple of years. So, I think we're in great shape.","As far as the public demand is concerned, it tends to, and I'd underscore tends, new public construction tends to support a lot of base, also which is very good for operations, uses up our fines and I think we can adjust quickly off of that. It also uses a lot of the high-end pricing of asphalt aggregates, and also fits our Asphalt business. So, I think we're in really good shape and I think our folks on a local level have done a very good job being coordinated and ready for whatever comes at them.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I would agree with that and I would also add, if you look at some of the comparative inventory numbers, either comparing our Q3 number back to the beginning of the year or to third quarter last year, it will appear that it's a little bit higher. But that's as a result of the acquisitions that we've made over the year and really doesn't reflect any significant movement in the inventory levels at our same-store quarries.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. That was my thought too. And then thinking about kind of the capital structure into next year, if 2 times to 2.5 times is the number, I mean, you should be right at the low-end, if not below, depending upon assumptions. What is the preference? Is M&A still of interest to you? Is it more organic growth? Is it buying shares back? Obviously, increasing the dividend is something you guys have talked about as well.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll let Suzanne take this, but I'll start with telling you that our capital priorities haven't changed. As you look at the M&A out there, we are as I said earlier, we're really focused on capturing the synergies of the acquisitions we've made and the greenfield work that we're working on, both of those tend to be some of our highest returns. But remember, our biggest engine of growth is going to be the volume growth and growing unit margins. You got a taste of that in Q3. It's exciting. We see it flowing rapidly into October and November. So \u2013 but I'll let Suzanne take capital priorities.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, absolutely. I mean, just adding on to what Tom said, which I agree with, the capital allocation priorities do remain the same. You know what they are. We've got a bit of both in there. But they are predicated on the waterfall that shows us making sure that we spend an appropriate amount of operating CapEx to make sure that our existing business that we maintain and grow the value of the franchise. We do have an eye toward a progressive dividend. We've talked about the fact that we want to make absolutely sure that it can be sustained through the cycle regardless of the amount. Whatever we get to, we just need to be able to sustain it. But we would expect that to progressively grow in line with earnings.","We look at growth CapEx. We've talked a bit about that. And then, we also have in the capital allocation priority returning excess cash to shareholders, primarily via share repurchase. And we have been in the market. Through the end of the third quarter, we spent about $100 million with respect to share repurchase. So, our job is to balance all those in an appropriate way and be disciplined about the use of capital and make sure that it goes into the areas that will be highest returning.","With respect to M&A in particular, obviously, we're going to look at M&A opportunities as they arise. But we will be returns focused. We will be thoughtful about multiples. We certainly don't want to be in a position where we overpay, particularly when there are other competing uses of our capital.","And I just want to reiterate the point, as Tom said, M&A is an important part of growth to the extent you get the right fit and the right returns. But always, always same-store growth, improving the business that you have is always going to be the most profitable business you have, and also the lowest risk because you own it and you have complete control over what you're doing.","So, we'll continue to look, but our principal focus, I think, in the near term is going to be fully integrating those businesses we have acquired, betting them down to make sure we capture all the synergies that we planned and that we can capture. And then, as I said earlier, I think it may have been the first or second question, we want to focus on making sure in our same-store businesses that we are improving that unit profitability. Does that help?","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Best of luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","I guess my first question is just as you look out to 2019, can you just speak to some of the inflationary buckets in the Aggregates group that you are concerned about? Is it mainly diesel that's going to move around and drive less visibility and I guess as a knock-on to the inflationary question, are there any tariffs that you are exposed to that might impact either CapEx or raw materials?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","If you step back and look at the Aggregates business and with the Aggregates-focused business, we're just different and I'd call us special in this area. We have clear potential to do quite well in an environment of rising commodity cost. And that's really driven by three things; improving prices; compounding over time, which we've talked about; and remember, higher fuel and logistics only widens the moat and now you're starting to see us starting to capture the widening of that moat. You saw the tip of that in Q3.","We own our major input, which is the rock in the ground. And the third point is there's plenty of room for improving unit margins with prices, better operating execution, and seeing fixed cost leverage. I'd take you back, as a reminder, over the past five years since the recovery began, our total cost of sales is up less than 1% per year with diesel being up 7% per year. So if you talk to our folks, they'd tell you that improving unit margins no matter what happens at the outside, it is our job, it's what we do. You saw progress of that in the third quarter. You've seen us do this before and you see us take great momentum on this into Q4 into 2019. So I have great confidence that we'll continue to grow unit margins regardless.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I would just add there, also referencing back to the slide deck when you get a chance. On slide 4, we have put in some longer-term trend data where we actually calculate our compound annual growth rate and we measure that as against trailing 12-month second quarter 2013, sort of really the start of the recovery.","I like this slide because it shows that the improvements we made are not sort of one quarter, one-year type improvement. These are incremental compounding improvements that we need to stay focused on and continue to drive. On that slide, it specifically calls out the one measure, which I think is a great one and says a lot about how nimble and flexible Vulcan is when it comes to managing through sort of whatever comes at you over a five-year period, and that's unit cost of sales has increased less than 1% over that five-year period.","And also on the slide, it's what I think is one of the most exciting numbers on the page and that is that through some compounding pricing improvement, over that five-year period, through managing our costs and efficiencies at the plant level, over that same period, our compound annual growth rate and gross profit per ton is 13%. That's a pretty \u2013 it's a pretty strong business model to take us forward.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Of course. Thanks for that color.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Just wanted to ask also on, if you think about pricing into 2019, I think as we were coming into this year, Tom, you were pretty bullish about pricing accelerating, particularly in the Southeast. I'm just wondering if there's any additional markets that you can call out when you look into next year that are kind of on a cusp for this breakout, whether it's from overly tight supply and breaking out. I know there's been fits and starts in mix this year that's impacted reported pricing. But I think you're too far ahead of yourself. As I look back, pricing really picked up in 2015 into 2016 as demand was very strong. Any regions that could maybe mimic that type of performance into 2019, 2020?.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Let me just kind of take you through the haves and have-nots on that. California, demand solid private, really big growth in highways. We've seen really good unit margin improvement in California. You've heard us talk about prices with step function in California over last year and this year, and I think that continues. They've also done a really good job of improving their cost and a lot of their operating efficiencies.","So, I think the issue \u2013 and I'm really looking at from a growth and unit margin perspective, I'll give both price and how I see that. So very healthy in California; Texas, solid private growth, big growth in public demand with highways. Remember, Prop 7 again kicks in this year with an additional $3 billion. Prices in Texas, I would call out as energized. That started kind in the second half, but it's really going to hit in January 2019 with fixed plant price improvements, costs have been improving, solid margin growth, and you're going to have upside in Texas potentially in 2019 and 2020 in energy projects and we'd go back to that later. Gulf Coast, I would tell you a little slower and kind of \u2013 not a little bit of growth in volumes, some price increases. But I would tell you a little bit harder, but they're doing a good job with it just because the volume is big and public is not there. Southeast, very healthy good private, good public. Big funding South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia. Pricing is very good, continues to be very good. Improving operating discipline, so you'll see another jump in margins in 2019.","East Coast, again very, very good. Growing private, growing public, much better pricing I think right now in bid work and going into 2019. And I think we've seen their operations breakout in the third quarter. So in the end, overall, I think our business model is on track. Solid \u2013 summary, solid private, growing public, prices moving up sharply in a lot of places, good operating disciplines, driving spend margins. I think we feel really good finishing this year and going into 2019.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just my last question is on Asphalt. Can you give us some perspective on how quickly can you actually raise pricing to offset inflation into next year or maybe another way to ask that, how many \u2013 what percentage of your markets have real-time escalators that could provide...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Let's step back. I'll let Suzanne kind of talk about what happened because I think it's important visibility to what happened in Asphalt in Q3 and then I'll touch some on the markets and what to expect.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Sure. I mean, Tom is right. I mean, the liquid asphalt is where we saw a pretty significant acceleration of price in the third quarter. We've had some price increases leading in before that and had raised our prices to take that increase into account and combat. So our prices actually went up about 8% in terms of what we were able to pass along to customers in the third quarter. But liquid asphalt cost in the third quarter went up 29% and that had an impact \u2013 that 29% had an impact of about $60 million in the third quarter. So that's a pretty tough number to overcome, particularly when it happens quickly like that. But just as you saw us be able to raise prices 8% going in, we will continue to raise prices to offset this 29% increase that we saw. I mean there's always just a bit of a time lag on the front end as you try to catch that upward curve.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think that's well explained. So, our prices went up $4. And sequentially quarter-over-quarter Asphalt went up for about $40, which is $2 of cost. Our unit margins were down $2.50. So you can see we were going to catch it except for we got caught again with an increase in liquid.","This is the one place in our business where commodity\/energy can hit us hard and fast. It \u2013 remember, it's only 10% of our business, but it is also only temporary. Unit margins will catch up. They always do. I think our Asphalt business has a very bright future, particularly with all the highway funding, which is a big driver of asphalt demand.","And it's really exciting if you look at where that money is and where we're in the Asphalt business or leader in the Asphalt business in Texas, Tennessee and California. So this will fix itself. It always does. And by the way when it turns down, we'll put a bunch of that in our pocket.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Understood. Thanks again. Best of luck.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Kathryn.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","First color is \u2013 first question is really just circling back on the rails, any color on rail line transportation bottlenecks easing? And also, I know that there were several rail lines that were washed out post-Hurricane Florence and wanted to get any color you have on recovery efforts there. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. The railroads continue to try to improve. We're still having issues. I think we're \u2013 they're slowly getting there, but it's cost us some volume and it's cost us some opportunities in 2018, and in fact, we're working on railroad stuff next week to try to make sure that we got it behind us as we enter 2019.","As far as the storm is concerned, we did have a washout, which cut us off for a few weeks from one of our yards. Bad news is, we couldn't get the yard. The good news was, we shipped rock to fill in the washout. So kind of a little bit of good and bad with that. But as far as our facilities are concerned and it's a great question. I think that we're in good shape including railroad ability to service our yards along the coast.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thanks. I wanted to focus a little bit on residential. We've noted in this \u2013 as you know we try to have a boots-on-the-ground view of the market and I found that in both Texas and in Tennessee in particular, we've seen some larger greenfield residential projects that were either put to the side in last cycle and are starting up or are being developed to address fast-growing markets. What are you seeing in terms of this type of trend, particularly in the light of rising interest rates, and would love to just get your view on that trend in general. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think we've seen a little bit of that. I'll also tell you, we've seen \u2013 we're seeing some very large ones kick-off, particularly in Southern California. In fact, one of the largest ever done is right outside of our quarry in San Diego, which we're really excited about. It'll start to really crank up next year.","If you look at res in our markets just fundamentally, ours are stronger than most around the country and the fundamentals are just there. You got population growth. You got continuing employment growth. You still got low inventories of houses, I think. So we see continued steady growth in res, maybe not as robust as it's been in the past, but steady. Maybe probably a little stronger in single than multi, which is okay for us because it's more Aggregates-intensive.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'd I just add to that the states that we called out there that have seen some of that improvement, Texas and California, keep in mind, those are two of our largest states in terms of Aggregates. So whatever is going on there, we will definitely get our fair share of it.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah. No, we're definitely aware of that. Then just in terms of \u2013 you've touched on SB1 in California and starting to see strong lettings out of that state, we've been tracking on our end. Could you talk about other states where you're seeing those dollars translating to volumes that perhaps passed legislation, for instance, like in Georgia and Texas, but you're seeing in terms of the pace that will \u2013 volumes will improve from the dollars? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. I'll touch on probably the newest ones. I think Georgia is actually starting to flow-through. We're seeing shipments on those big projects that we've talked about. Texas is the most mature, we've got Prop 7, as you know, with additional $3 billion in 2019, they've really got their act together, and I think they'll get that worked out pretty fast. On the IMPROVE Act in Tennessee, which is a 40% increase in funding in Tennessee. Tennessee DOT, I would describe it has done an excellent job and one of the fastest to get worked out. We're already starting to ship on both Asphalt and Aggregates on projects. We've got a lot of work \u2013 a number of jobs booked for 2019. As I said, we'll actually see a little bit in 2018, which is quite quick.","South Carolina is a little slower. We've not seen anything in 2018, probably see it being in 2019. But remember, South Carolina had the big bonds from a few years ago, so we've seen a big slug of big interstate work, which we'll ship on \u2013 we're shipping on now and will flow into 2019, which will kind of bridge us over to Act 40 (60:46). Is that giving you some clarity?","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah. No, it definitely does because it helps to set expectations for California because the way we've seen it, it typically takes at least 24-plus months for the dollars to hit to the volumes to actually get flowing. So, that was helpful.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Right.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you. And then finally, one of the things that we've seen with these big infrastructure projects that's maybe a little bit different than the past is they're really \u2013 they're very large projects...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Right.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","...they're multiple years. But they may not be new projects. They're more like I'm adding three additional lanes to a current project. For the markets in which you serve, are you seeing a similar type trend or are you seeing perhaps more of a mix of just entirely new roads in addition to significant expansions?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I would call it a mix. I would also point out that the inside to this is that these large projects, the different DOTs are at different stages of being able to handle them and handle them in a timely manner. Texas, like as I said earlier, has done the best job of giving big projects and having them ready and have them flow through smoothly. We are just seeing in a lot of states the big design build jobs take substantially longer than maybe what is budgeted or is planned by the DOT or the contractors. And we've been talking about this.","I think that we have a better handle on that as we plan for 2019 and 2020 than maybe we did as we planned for 2017 and 2018 just because we know the right questions to ask. But you're right. It is a mix and it is taking longer to get done. Now, once they get going, they're quite efficient.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Perfect. And based on the quarry run you held at Nashville, your inventories look just fine in Middle Tennessee. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Did you win?","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Not so much. Not so much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks for participating.","Operator","And next we will hear from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Notwithstanding the weather issues, pretty good volume growth here. I presume that's helping you work through some of that backlogged work. Is there a way for us to think about what's left in that backlog, Tom, that's priced well below the ASP at least we can see today? Is that likely to bleed into the construction season next year, or is there an opportunity with some decent fall, winter conditions to work through a lot of that?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think is what we've been saying is week-over-week, month-over-month, the work we're putting in is at higher prices. So \u2013 and we have put in a lot more work. So I would say that the bid work will continue to step up much similar that what you saw between Q3 and Q4. As Suzanne called out, it was 50 basis points.","And so, as every day you're working off old work, replacing it with new higher price work, I think the market gets it. And so there will be two \u2013 there will be kind of two stages to the price increase, month-over-month, week-over-week, the bid work will continue to march up, and that will just continue through 2019. And then your fixed plant work, you'll see a bigger jump in January as fixed plant price increases go into effect for the year. Does that make sense?","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","It does. Thank you. And then, on the outlook for this year, has the expectation for U.S. Aggregates changed at all? Has that been impacted by weather as well?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","The short answer to your question, yeah, U.S. Aggregates has been impacted. As I step back and look at it, these assets are a really good strategic fit for us. We'll probably be a little short, about $50 million, maybe in the $45 million range. Three issues there. And the short-term issue is weather, as you called out, really related to Michael. As we talked about earlier, the rail service interruption have been real for us there. They have cost us volume. They have cost us opportunities in customer service. And then there's \u2013 the third item there would be there's a very large \u2013 there's some very large project work in Florida. There's backlog. It's to the tune of about 2 million tons. We expected it to ship in 2018. We'll start shipping in 2019. Probably a blessing in disguise with the rail issues we have that it did get pushed back.","But one of the things we're really pleased with, with Agg USA, is the plant improvements and the efficiency improvements and cost improvements that we implemented this year. It gets us set up for 2019. I think if you look at 2019's plan, we'll capture the synergies in volume, cost, prices and unit margins. And so far, we can't control temporary issues out of your control obviously, but we're pleased with execution, plan and strategic fit.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Okay, perfect. And then one more, I guess breaking out the crystal ball here, but do you guys have a view on liquid asphalt costs as it relates to IMO 2020, possible tightening in the market? Any preliminary thoughts there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","We've read a lot about it. There's all kinds of theories that it will cause diesel to go up and liquid to go \u2013 AC to go down. I think what's important about that is, as we talk about all the time, we'll handle what \u2013 we can't control that, we'll handle what gets thrown at us. We'll adjust accordingly with price and with escalators, and we'll watch it very closely, but too early to tell. And I don't know that we need a view as much as we need to be ready for whatever happens.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Understood. Okay. I appreciate the color.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Schrier with Citi.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for getting me in there.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I want to go back. Last quarter, you had mentioned that you were kind of expecting that trend you have in same-store shipments to continue. I think you were at 11%. And I'm curious \u2013 and I understand you had weather in September \u2013 I'm looking at slide 5, that July and August was 7%. So, is there anything to read in there in the quarter? Was there residential slowness, was there any kind of project delays or anything in there or do you feel that July and August on a same-store basis met your expectations?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think July and August were meeting our expectations. There's no slowdown. That is really shipping at a pretty good pace. And last quarter, same-store, if I remember, it was \u2013 or the same-store this year, this quarter, it was 10% and 6% (01:07:46). There was a lot off from what we had last quarter. I think if you look at the underlying demand and all the leading indicators and what's happening on the ground, we feel really good about volume. We continue to ship strong in October. We called out Texas, but every place \u2013 even in Texas, we were shipping when we have a ray of sunshine, and the rest of the country has been strong. So, I think we feel really good about underlying demand, project work starting to flow, public funding starting to flow in, kind of steady on the private side. And I think October only gives us more confidence in that.","The mid-single-digit for next year, it's just too early to tell. We've got work to do. We have confidence in that, but we've got a lot of work to do on that as we've talked about in the call.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then...","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","And I think again, we \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 I think, again, that mid-single-digits for next year \u2013 and my favorite word is thoughtful \u2013 we've tried to be thoughtful about putting that together. And as we get more information leading into when we next speak to you guys with Q4 and as we go through next year, you get more and more visibility. There's more activity being booked. And so we would, as we always would, adjust that as needed as we go forward next year. If things pick up and are strong then we will come back in and share with you our latest view on that.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about Concrete. It seemed like you had a pretty strong result there, especially considering \u2013 I know Virginia had the weather but you had pricing, you had the material spread. So I'm curious if you could talk about your expectations in Concrete. Do you see the fundamentals there to continue to expand your material margins?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes, we \u2013 the short answer is, yes, we do. Our Concrete businesses are in, what I'll call, privileged markets, both the growth profile and the structure of the markets. But we \u2013 even with volume down, we did better, and that was really weather in Virginia. But, again, there are \u2013 prices continue to move up and offset any raw materials costs or fuel costs. And we would expect that flowing into 2019.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will now move to Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Michael Wood - Instinet LLC","Hi.","Suzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Michael Wood - Instinet LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the residential side of your private spending. The slowdown according to the homebuilders and building product companies seemed to have accelerated really near the third quarter. And I appreciate your comments it's in the large projects that are about to get started. But if the slowdown does worsen, when would you expect to see the impact on your business as like when would your backlog that you have now currently get worked through?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","As we look into 2019, we don't see the slowdown in the projects that we see out there in our markets. So, they'd be further out if it \u2013 much further out if it happens. And again, the fundamentals are there, our backlogs and talking to our customers, we actually feel kind of good about slow and steady. But we're not seeing a slowdown in our market. So, it's hard for me to predict it, but it'd be pretty far out because we have some visibility to it.","Michael Wood - Instinet LLC","Is your California mix between private and public relatively similar to your national mix?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I would \u2013 yeah, it's probably not too far out in any of our markets, particularly with our Asphalt business in California. You got to remember that with public coming on, it really helps the Asphalt business and the flow-through of Aggregates into that business and the base that goes underneath it. So, we are looking forward to more highway projects in California.","Michael Wood - Instinet LLC","Great. And just finally I wanted to ask about the cost control, besides just managing your operations around the weather, is there anything else that you have to highlight in terms of what's helping you reduce costs at your quarries? If you can give us some details, I'd appreciate that.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. It's just core disciplines, and we've taken a look at our largest facilities, a number of them had teams look at them for opportunity searches. I think our folks are always doing this. If I took you to any of our plants, they're going to have a conversation about how to improve throughput of the plant, how to improve downtime in the plant, how to get more out of their fuel costs, out of their explosives costs. There's nothing here that is anything except for really, really good hard core operating disciplines and attention to detail and sharing knowledge across our footprint. And if you talk to any of our folks, they'd just tell you that's their job, that's what they do.","Michael Wood - Instinet LLC","Great. Thank you.","J.

Please note, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations home page of the website. A recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Additionally, you can sign up to receive future news releases under the e-mail alerts quick link on the Investor Relations home page.","Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our call today. Our second quarter results are another really solid step towards our longer-term goals. We finished the first half of the year on plan, and well-positioned to stay on plan for the balance of the year. The business is running well, as expected. And we're seeing good things come together.","Higher public funding for transportation infrastructure is now converting into increased shipments. Pricing momentum, including our backlog work, continues to strengthen and we've turned the corner on cost challenges we faced in 2017 with flow-throughs moving towards long range norms. We expect each of these trends to continue through the second half of this year and into 2019. We are well-positioned for continued shipment growth, compounding pricing improvements, and further gains in unit profitability.","Now, we experienced spikes in diesel and liquid asphalt costs, but these headwinds will be offset by pricing gains over time. Diesel prices have risen 28% year-over-year and 59% since June 2016. Those increases are not yet fully reflected in our reported product pricing. But we are already pricing worth (00:03:17) higher. Remember, higher logistics costs widen the natural economic moat around our quarries. Also, liquid asphalt prices have risen 22% year-over-year putting pressure on our Asphalt margins. But hear again, these headwinds will ultimately be offset, and we're already seeing prices improve.","Good things are happening as public construction demand joins a sustained private recovery. And our Aggregates-focus business model positions us extremely well for this dual recovery. We are keeping our midpoint projection for full-year adjusted EBITDA at $1.2 billion. And we expect to move into 2019 with very good momentum in market demand, in shipments, and in pricing.","Now, let me touch a bit more detail \u2013 on a bit more detail on the trends we're seeing in our core Aggregates segment with a focus on shipments, pricing, and cost. John will then recap our full-year outlook, and I'll sum up with some closing comments. First, our strength in shipments. Public demand is kicking in. We're finally beginning to see the transportation funding increases that passed in many Vulcan-served states showing up in our shipments.","And as I pointed out last quarter, we expect this demand to build over multiple years as state DOTs and contractors deliver on their large backlogs of bigger and more complex projects. At the same time, private end-use demand in Vulcan-served markets continues to recover steadily, growing at a rate that is significantly ahead of the rest of the country.","Our local sales teams are covering our markets and serving our customers well. We've taken steps to give them more time to partner with our customers and help them grow. They are reaping the benefits of more back office support, less paperwork, and more time with our customers, and it's paying off nicely. We expect strong shipment growth at a pace similar to the second quarter for the balance of the year, based on demand patterns and our booking pace. And the shipment results we reported this quarter don't yet reflect the strength we're seeing coming in California or Virginia. Those states were actually down in the quarter.","Regarding California, we're very encouraged by the letting data we've seen in efforts to accelerate public projects. We're having success in booking key new jobs. We expect second half shipments in California to be up mid- to high-single digits over the prior year, with that growth still supported by strong private demand. We continue to expect the benefit of stronger public construction activity in California to start impacting our shipments in 2019. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on longer-term materials pricing improvements in this key state. Our average selling prices for aggregates in California improved 7% compared to the second quarter of 2017.","So, to recap, we're seeing real strength in shipments, 11% same-store shipment growth in the quarter as public demand joined to sustain recovery in private demand with a similar growth rate expected for the remainder of the year.","Second, let's talk about pricing. Geographic mix impacted our total reported average selling prices in the second quarter. Excluding this mix impact, average aggregate selling prices improved 3%. Given the continuing recovery and public demand, geographic and product mix may continue to affect reported average sales prices for the next few quarters. But let me tell you, I'm not concerned about this mix effect. It's good for the business to sell a full product mix and we're focused on driving prices higher for all product types. Please don't base funds (00:07:45) across all geographies. We like the pricing trends we're seeing in our backlogs. And project pricing continues to strengthen, and will throughout the year. We're pressing for second half price increases in many of our markets across all customer segments.","As you know, there's a natural lag between pricing and shipments. For example, we're shipping today on several large public jobs, initially priced well over a year ago. Our reported pricing will benefit as we work off older jobs and shift on more recently quoted work. And, of course, the shipments strength we've experienced with public demand joining what has been a private-led recovery bodes very well for pricing strength into 2019 and beyond.","Third, let's discuss how we convert that top line growth into profit growth. We're doing a good job controlling the cost that we can control, moving toward more normal flow-through rates on same-store incremental revenue. For the quarter, our unit cost of sales in Aggregates on a same-store basis fully adjusted was essentially flat.","We delivered with operating leverage and shipment strength. But this per ton cost benefit was offset by the spike in diesel costs and also by distribution-related costs that are behind us as we move into the second half of the year. Excluding higher unit cost for diesel, our same-store flow-through rate on incremental sales for the first half was 56%, a clear move in the right direction.","And we expect further improvements in the second half of the year. Diesel cost ultimately passed-through in our product pricing. But despite diesel, we finished the first half essentially on plan with respect to operating cost results and total gross profit for Aggregates segment.","And following the flooding from Hurricane Harvey, we've now finished dredging our Houston port facility and our new ships are fully operational bringing additional cost efficiencies to the business in the second half of the year.","Our continuing world-class safety record underscores our confidence in our operating discipline and execution. Our MSHA\/OSHA incident rate through the first half of the year is less than one injury for every 200,000 employee hours worked. Our people are focused on every aspect of operational excellence and it shows.","Now, I'll hand it off to John for a brief review of our full-year outlook for profitability and cash flow. John?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom. Let me begin by providing a bit more background regarding our balance of year outlook. In our core Aggregates segment, as Tom mentioned, we expect continued strength and shipments roughly in line with the second quarter results. We now project full-year same-store Aggregates shipment growth of between 7% and 9% compared to our beginning-of-year expectation of 4% to 6%.","We expect freight-adjusted price increases in the second half of approximately 3% in line with our beginning-of-year projection. However, given geographic mix impacts through the first half, we now project a full-year increase in reported freight-adjusted average selling prices of 2% to 3%. Absent these mix impacts, which are largely tied to stronger than expected shipments in certain lower priced markets, pricing momentum was in line with our plans through the first half and should strengthen through the second half and into 2019.","Our projection for full-year freight-adjusted revenues for the Aggregates segment remains in line or slightly ahead of our year-beginning plan. Again, as a function of stronger shipments at a marginally lower geographic price mix.","As noted, diesel prices in the first half rose more than projected. We now expect full-year diesel costs for the Aggregates segment to be approximately $15 million higher than in our year-beginning plan. Again, higher diesel prices should support higher Aggregates pricing over the longer-term. As, along with other logistics constraints, they serve to widen the economic moats around the better-located quarries.","Absent the short-term impact of the rise in diesel costs, Aggregates segment gross profit for the first half was in line with plan. Aggregates segment unit profitability should improve in the second half, as expected, as the business benefits from higher volumes, solid operating disciplines and the absence of certain costs tied to hurricanes and other weather events in the prior year period.","In total, full-year Aggregates segment gross profit should approximate, beginning-of-year expectations, as higher revenues offset the impact of higher diesel costs. In contrast, first half results for the Asphalt segment, trail plan in the first half and likely will remain below plan for the second half and full-year.","Due primarily to the increase in liquid asphalt prices, first half results missed plan by approximately $15 million. Second half material margins, although stabilizing and improving, likely will remain below beginning-of- year projections due to higher input cost. And we expect full-year segment results will miss plan by approximately $20 million.","Concrete segment results were in line for the first half and should meet plan for the full-year. Management expectations for SAG expense, interest expense, taxes and operating and maintenance CapEx remain unchanged. Taken as a whole, we continue to project full-year net earnings of between $4 and $4.65 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.","We do note that the current year impact of higher diesel and liquid AC prices may make the higher end of this range difficult to reach, despite the shipment strength we see. As Tom referenced, our midpoint expectation for full-year adjusted EBITDA supported by our bottoms up business unit projections, currently stands at $1.2 billion.","Again, the business is generally performing as expected, with shipment growth better than planned and petroleum-related input cost worse than planned. Strengthening shipments to public end-users, plus improving pricing and unit margins, plus maturing growth investments should position the business very well heading into 2019 and beyond. Our overall capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as does our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.","Now, I'd like to wrap up with a reminder of the fundamental strength of our franchise and aggregates-focused business model. Ours is a business that, in the last five years, has done the following. In the Aggregates segment, using trailing 12 months figures, we have compounded shipments at a 6.5% annual rate. Unit pricing has compounded at a 4.3% rate with unit costs growing at less than 1%. Unit gross profit has, as a result, compounded at nearly 13% annually. And total company adjusted EBITDA has compounded at a 20% clip.","Furthermore, ours is a business with attractive cash flow dynamics. As noted last quarter, after tax cash flow from earnings, that's adjusted EBITDA, less working capital growth of $50 million, operating and maintenance CapEx of $250 million, and cash taxes of $75 million, should approximate $825 million for the year.","And all of this backed by an advantaged, irreplaceable, essential asset base. And a culture centered on taking care of each other and winning the right way. And now, this business sits at another positive inflection point. With public construction activity beginning what should be a multi-year recovery backed by new, higher dedicated funding.","But as great as Vulcan's business is, and you know it's a great business, it is an even better place to work and an even better team to be a part of. I will miss it deeply. But I have every confidence, every confidence, in our direction and continued success.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, John. As you all know, this is John's last earnings call as our CFO. I want to thank John for his outstanding work as part of our senior leadership team. He has been a key player in developing and refining the fundamentals of our strategy and our business models. Working together as a closely knit team, we and our employees throughout the company are shaping a direction that has delivered and will continue to deliver great value for our shareholders, our customers, and our employees. And you can continue to count on that kind of continuity and steadiness both in strategic direction and our daily operational excellence that is a hallmark of the way we do business at Vulcan.","I would like to personally thank John for his friendship and partnership and all that he has done for his Vulcan family. Thank you, John. And although I'm sad to see John moving on at the end of the year, we have had an organized smooth transition under way. Suzanne Wood, who joins us as our CFO on September 1, is an outstanding talent with deep and broad experience. She will bring her own highly-regarded leadership abilities and fresh perspectives. She will be a key member of the team that is tightly-focused on strategic growth and superior execution in all aspects of our business. That is of the utmost importance to us.","It's how we go about making our company better every day. We know what we need to do to maximize the value of our asset base and our franchise. We are going to keep focused on that and on day-in and day-out execution. We are more than ready to meet the growing demand in public and private sectors. We are securing increasing business in projects of all sizes from major projects to small construction jobs, all across our footprint with particular growth in our high-margin, high-population markets. We will continue to achieve price and volume gains that further improve our superior unit margins. And we will remain keenly focused on our operational excellence and maintaining our world-class safety performance.","And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","First off, wanted to say, John, being your last call, it's been great working with you and wish you the best.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, bud. Appreciate it.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","First off, I wanted to just talk about the kind of turning the corner on cost challenges that you guys have talked about. Really, if you could just kind of go into more detail on how to think about the flow-through in the bridge to your expectations here in the back half understanding your \u2013 some of these things are behind you. But just really trying to get our head around the shift in incrementals needed to kind of get to that original Aggregates kind of go \u2013 growth \u2013 gross profit goals.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Trey, I'll start and \u2013 just with a view of the quarter in the first half, and I think Tom will comment on the full-year, and we're going to clarify as best we can. First thing we would say, as we said in the prepared remarks and in the release, is we're on plan. For the Aggregates segment, we are on our plan for the first half of the year. Albeit driven a little bit by stronger shipments than originally projected, offsetting the higher diesel cost than we had expected. But we are on our plan for the first half of the year.","And in terms of flow-throughs and just the way we look at it as a management team, internally. One, always trying to take a little bit longer-term view of that number. But as we look at the first half, first, you got to look at it on a same-store basis. I'll just remind everybody, the flow-through on acquired revenue, particularly Ag U.S.A., is always going to distort those numbers. So, you got to look at it on a same-store basis.","As we look at same-store flow-through the first half, we see 43%, absent the year-over-year impact in diesel, which we will overcome as we move forward and put in their own (00:22:57) pricing, that's 56%. I noted in the release, I don't want to distract anybody, but if you look at the pensionary class and what that did absent that, it's 59% to 60%. So, our main message on flow-through and on the business as a whole for the first half is that we are on plan.","We also expect those flow-throughs, as we've said, I think all year long, to improve meaningfully in the second half such that the full-year number is basically in line with what you'd expect from our beginning-of-year guidance, of course, and at or slightly above that 60% long-term number.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Trey, in the second half, we will definitely see flow-through improvement and it's really driven by three things. Number one, prices will continue to rise. Our backlog pricing is much higher. You've got fuel offset in that. And also we're just simply working off our work. We've got some work we're working off right now that's one or two years old and is priced out long ago.","Then, second, we'll see significant cost improvements. First piece of that is we've moved past the old storm-related and some of the transportation costs that we saw last year and we saw in the first half of the year. The second piece of that is we'll reap the benefit and not the cost of the first half improvements we did in some big plants that we took down in preparation for the season.","And the third thing is, you're just going to see that volume growth continue and it's really driven by the big jump in public demand. So, I think we're confident in how we did in the first half and how it sets us up in the second half.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And then, Trey, if you wanted to square \u2013 and others, if you want to square the guidance for the year and just taking a look at the total business and kind of how we get there, again, this is all consistent with our plan. We're looking for about $160 million of profit improvement in the second half year-over-year. And again, if the question is how do you get there, here's the way we look at it.","We've got significant benefit in the second half from acquisitions, about $30 million year-over-year that's mostly Ag U.S.A. We've got, as you know, significant operating cost and margin improvement in the Aggregates segment in the second half. Again, we're comping over a bunch of storm-related cost in the second half that shouldn't repeat, that's about another $30 million to $35 million.","We've got approximately 10 million more tons in the second half of this year on a same-store basis than we had in the second half of last year. That drives its own benefit at a strong flow-through way. As Tom mentioned, we've got higher pricing in the second half than a year ago. That's probably another $40 million of benefit year-over-year on the second half. We'll have a little bit of contribution from the downstream businesses, not a lot year-over-year given the headwinds in our Asphalt segment. And SAG, that's slightly up in the second half over the prior year, maybe $5 million, but largely flat.","So, look, our plan is basically intact. We're kind of following the exact plan we had at the beginning of the year. Only difference is really being higher aggregates shipments driven by stronger public shipments, which is fantastic, offsetting higher than anticipated diesel costs and helping offset what will be a full-year miss in our Asphalt segment.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. And then, second one for me is just around a lot of the noise out there around SB1. Obviously, a lot of chatter, possibility for repeal, obviously, on the ballot for November. Just trying to get maybe your updated thoughts around how we should be thinking about that or how that could shake out. I mean, understanding you guys don't have a crystal ball either but some of the polls that we see look like \u2013 could be pretty much a coin toss at this point. But as you guys know, these polls can sometimes be a little bit deceiving depending on sample size and the population there. So, really just trying to get any updated thoughts you guys might have around SB1 from where you sit today.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I think your opening comment about SB1 was completely accurate. There is a lot of noise, and there will continue to be noise for the next four months about it. But let's kind of step back on and look at the facts as we know it in California. And I would point out four things.","Number one, remember, California is the fifth largest economy in the world. And it's also got some of the country's worst roads. Number two, California voters understand how bad the roads are and of all \u2013 they've already supported 20 local initiatives that increase transportation funding, we saw that year-and-a-half ago. And fact number three, as you know, SB1 was firewalled for transportation uses only in June which is very good for us and also removes the biggest argument for repeal. And fact four, SB \u2013 you've got to remember, SB1 has incredibly broad and deep support in the state.","So, those are facts if we'd go on (00:28:16) California (00:28:17) don't forget three other points. Remember, Caltrans is already moving. So, by November, they will have already collected an additional $4.7 billion for highway construction. And those local initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they will raise $50 billion over the life of the initiatives. Fact number three, remember, Vulcan shipments and prices to the public market in California are going to be higher the second half of this year. They'll be higher than that in 2019, and they'll be higher than that in 2020 given our current pipeline and backlogs.","So, our success in California is enhanced by SB1 but it's not dependent on SB1. Look, we have a fantastic position in the fifth largest economy in the world. Our backlogs are higher, our \u2013 the pricing on those backlogs are higher than they've been in years and they're accelerating and that price momentum which was very good in first half of the year will continue to grow balance of this year and into next year and into 2020. So, again, our success in \u2013 we're going to be successful in California. SB1 will only enhance that.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the thoughts, Tom, and good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Jerry.","Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Good morning. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just wanted \u2013 morning. Just wanted to start and get some more color on pricing in light of such strong shipment growth. So, double-digit volume growth in the quarter. Can you kind of help reconcile that strength with 3% clean pricing?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. So, pricing momentum is good and improving. If you take a closer look at our individual markets, we're actually where we thought we'd be. It's really 3% or 4%. 80% of our markets that we're in, had prices in the 3% to 4% range. And we've been raising prices all along.","So, as we work our whole work, we'll see it replaced with higher price jobs. Some of that \u2013 the mix are very similar prices that we're working on today are priced one or two years ago. As we always, say rising transportation cost is good for pricing in our economic moat, same thing for diesel. And when we're quoting higher prices over \u2013 because of those things right now. And this will keep building the second half of the year, our booking and backlogs or higher prices.","Remember, accelerating volumes are very good for pricing. Public work is driving improved volumes and prices. And I'll give you a couple of examples like this. So, in the first half of this year, we've seen California, Virginia and Georgia up mid- to high-single digits. So, the pricing is coming. And it's \u2013 and you see it across the vast majority of our markets.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I mean, can we just remind a number of you that it's not atypical at all for us to have a six-month lag on average between when we quote something and when we ship it. It obviously varies by job type. But six months on average isn't way off. So, a lot of what we shipped in the second quarter this year, we quoted and booked in Q3 and Q4 last year. So, when we referenced improving pricing in our backlogs and when you've heard us talk in Q1, I think pretty clearly and obviously in this call pretty clearly about the direction we have as a company on pricing, and the fact that that's only reinforced by strength in public, you're going to see that come with a lag.","So, what you're saying is good for pricing in the second half, but it is equally good for pricing in 2019. And look, this is a business that's compounded pricing through the recovery so far our business at almost 4.5%. Pricing comp is probably only improving in total, some periods higher, some periods lower. Mix is going to affect it in a given quarter. But don't lose sight over the power of the business model. None of that has changed and really has a whole another push from these higher logistics costs, which widened the economic moats around our quarries. So, I hope you can tell it's not something that we're overly concerned with on this. And we see it as something that's actually be quite positive for the business moving forward.","Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, in California, you gave us pricing up 7% year-over-year. Could you help \u2013 give us an idea of how shipments were in the quarter? And then, related to that, if you think of SB1 as we head into the end of the year and maybe people \u2013 who knows \u2013 maybe some people get cold feet. Is there any pull forward into late 2018 in what was supposed to be beginning in 2019?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at the shipments for the year, we're just a little ahead of where we were prior year in the quarter, they were down. Now, all of that is timing of how we work in California. As we said, we had a strong first quarter.","The private demand in California continues to be solid. The second half, its growth is some private but a lot of that is public flow-through. If you look at our backlogs, both in volume and price in California are up where we should be. We don't see a lot of SB1 in 2019. It'll really be in 2020 and beyond.","But, in spite of that, in 2019, our backlogs will support the volumes that we're projecting the second half. So \u2013 and, as I said in my comment about SB1, remember, Caltrans will have already collected additional $4.7 billion by November and you've got the impact of the local funding of an additional $1.35 billion. So, there's a lot of increased funding in California and I think we feel good about it. As I said, about \u2013 when I was talking about SB1, (00:34:26) second half of this year, we feel good about 2019, and that'll grow into 2020.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And again, just to be clear, I mean, we're super excited about what Caltrans is doing. It's just we don't expect it to show up in our shipments in 2018 and that's always been our view that's not a change. So, anything that happens there is effectively upside but very good for 2019.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","The shipment strength we saw in the quarter just as a reminder, came without help from California, without help from Virginia, without help from Georgia. Many of our higher priced markets, all those markets are super healthy long-term. Just some timing issues there in the quarter. And you're going to see good growth in all those areas in the second half.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","We have full flavor on Caltrans. And they really \u2013 like John said, they've done a good job. I mean, we've already backlogged 1 million tons of aggregate off of SB1 funding and about 300,000 tons of asphalt. This is really early in the game. I would not expect to see much of that in 2018. It will be 2019 and 2020.","Ben Burud - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll hear from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Morning, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Morning. Thank you for taking my questions today. Still on the policy vein, wanted to shift coast and go to Georgia, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina, which we in our work have seen some better lettings in the first half of 2018. Given strong lettings, obviously, there can be a delay between the dollars and lettings which we saw last year. But also, possibly, wanted to get a little bit more color of, now that we've seen good lettings numbers out of those key states, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of work flow-through and also what you're seeing in lettings going into 2019 based on the early read from this year? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think that we're seeing a turn in a lot of markets. When I say a turn, it is in, really, a turn in profitability driven by volume and price. And that turn is also \u2013 the catalyst for that turn is the turn in public work. And I'll talk about three markets where we've seen a big turn there.","The first one would be coastal Texas, and we saw a big turn in coastal Texas probably in the last six, eight months. We had a downturn there. It's recovered. The private side is recovering. There's good highway work. Our volumes are dramatically up. You're seeing prices \u2013 actually, prices in the second quarter rose over prices in the first quarter, and they'll continue to rise through the year. And all of that's driving marked improving profitability in coastal Texas.","And that's without the impact of the energy work that you're hearing out there. There's dozens of energy jobs and billions of dollars that are in the planning stages. We don't expect to see that until 2019 and 2020. And then behind that, you're going to see, in 2019 and 2020, you'll start to see non-highway infrastructure pull through, with Harvey projects that are in the design stages right now. Those \u2013 I could \u2013 I think there's 30 of those in pre-planning process. So, very exciting in coastal Texas.","Turning now from there to Tennessee, particularly Nashville, is a great example, Kathryn, where that has been a very healthy state for a long time. But we actually \u2013 the Tennessee DOT has done an excellent job already pulling through improved ag projects. That's a state where those \u2013 some of those projects will hit this year. And with that turn in public, you've also \u2013 again, you've got the \u2013 you have the price and the volume flowing through in Tennessee.","The last one I'd mention is a state that's been hot for a while, Florida. DOT is really solid private, really solid public. You're starting to see infrastructure \u2013 not how we infrastructure flow-through in Florida but with the big public work maturing in Florida, you get a better mix. So, actually, our overall profitability and our unit profitability is getting better with the volume and mix.","And you could go on and on and on across the country, wherever the funding is, has \u2013 is starting to mature. And as we always talk about, you'll see a layering effect of that over the next three or four years.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","(00:38:50)","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Kathryn, just to walk you out, I mean, I know you understand all this actually quite well. But from inside our shop, in each of those markets and others, there's a turn not just in volume but also in profitability, as Tom said, and in pricing. So, if you took coastal Texas, and we've talked a lot about that over the last year, given the hurricane impacts and those kind of things.","Again, that's turning in volume and you know very well the DOT outlook, you know the Harvey Relief Fund outlook, you know the recovery in private, you know the energy projects. All of which give great visibility. That's a market where, in the first half, we would have had \u2013 the way we measure it on a freight-adjusted basis , down pricing. That freight headwind to the way we report pricing is going to reverse. And on top of that, our overall pricing is moving up. So, if you looked at kind of down pricing first half, you'd see up pricing in the last month to give you a feel.","So, that's a really good story moving forward. Same kind of dynamic of the places. You had asked about Georgia in your question. We really like what we see in Georgia. Of course, still some issues with capacity constraints, really, logistics constraints, I should say. Not ours, but the markets. In particular some rail issues there, that's one place that's been affecting us. But the outlook on public and just the backlog of work to be done bodes, again, really well for the second half. Continued pricing; pricing in that market has been very strong and, again, strength into 2019.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Kathryn, Georgia. A little bit of good news in Georgia. Over top of all the DOT funding that has been growing in the state, we also starting to see some local initiatives particularly in South Georgia right in the middle of where all the Ag U.S.A. rail yards are. It's about $0.5 billion that will flow-through. Again, that will take a while, but we're pleased. We're very pleased with that in light of what's going on with Ag USA.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","That's helpful. Tagging on to your commentary on pricing. For the second half, you've already commented a bit in the Q&A just about the flow-through of pricing and how it takes time. But just to be really clear on that 2% to 3% guide for the year, is that on a freight-adjusted or non-freight-adjusted basis because one would imply an acceleration of pricing trends in the second half while the other would imply a deceleration of trends, and just a quick clarification on that point?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","First of all...","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","And then also \u2013 Go ahead.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","No, first of all, that would be \u2013 I'm sorry to interrupt you. That is freight-adjusted.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","And we would tell you that will accelerate not just in the second half but through the second half and into 2019.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Perfect. And then, finally, in the \u2013 you might have already answered this in terms of the incremental margin question. But just to be clear, following up on a question we've had for the past few quarters on the incremental margins. Any impact on how Aggregates USA impacted the incremental margin calculation? And are there any other items that we should take into consideration that won't happen in the second half of the year like the Houston dredging cost, like the Panamax ship and like the weather concept perhaps wasn't outlined earlier?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think John covered that in a little \u2013 very \u2013 in his first remark on pricing on flow-throughs. But we won't face a lot of the storm challenges that we faced in 2018 \u2013 in, excuse me, 2017. And we said that it would take us through the second quarter to get those behind us. That includes dredging, that includes some of the other transportation costs we had and on top of that, our new ships are now in place and shipping.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Kathryn in the quarter. In the quarter, the \u2013 again, just, we had, as you know, we called it out $7-plus-million of diesel headwind. Again, we'll catch up on that on pricing, helps our pricing. We have a little bit less than $10 million of elevated distribution costs that should not repeat in the second half that hit the quarter. But again, as we get into the second half, and I know you're all familiar of what we're comping over in terms of the difficulties we had with last year storms. But we should have $30 million to $35 million of cost improvement year-over-year in the second half. Some of that is cost from last year second half not repeating. Some of that is the fact that our own internal plans has some costs front-loaded in the first half. I think we called that out in Q1, for example. And then, of course, as Tom mentioned, we get the benefit of higher operating leverage or stronger volumes in the second half. So, despite the new headwind, we should see our unit cost improve markedly and our flow-throughs improve markedly in the second half. All on the same-store basis is really the way to look at.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Right. Well, thank you very much for answering my questions today. Good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Kathryn. Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. John, best of luck. It was a pleasure working with you over the last several years. First question was on \u2013 a follow-up on the incremental margin outlook and the discussion around 60% in the long-term, and I think coming into the year with an expectation of 65% to 70% because of some of these one-time items that you talked about that occurred last year that's not occurring this year. Just want to be clear on the incremental, though. Does the view of improving incremental margins factor in the rise in diesel costs or should we expect that 60% to, I guess, 70% incremental moving forward to be if you strip out diesel?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think that the second half incremental takes into account the increase in diesel cost. I think that that's built in. What we've told you, it is a headwind, but it continues to be less and less of a headwind as the year goes along.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Garik, in the second half, we're probably expecting diesel of around \u2013 it varies by market \u2013 but around $2.60. So, obviously, there's some uncertainty around that. We'll kind of see how it plays out.","But, keep in mind, we've got basically stronger volumes offsetting diesel impact in the Aggregates segment. So, full-year, our expectation for the Aggregates segment is darn close to what it was at the beginning of the year. Slightly different way of getting there. We do expect to have a headwind from our Asphalt segment due liquid AC costs relative to our beginning-of-year expectations. But when we sit at the end of the year and look backwards, we expect a flow-through rate in our Aggregates segment that's really not that different than what we've expected at the beginning of the year.","And again, I'd just caution anybody, looking at just flow-throughs on a quarterly basis, they going \u2013 they swing a lot. So, you got to take a bit of a longer-term view. And I would remind that by the time we finish this year, we're going to look back over the previous five years and we're going to find out that our flow-through rate for five years have been about 62% or something. So, pretty much in line with long-term expectation.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, got it. And just follow-up question on volumes. You called out California and Virginia as being lighter in the quarter, should rebound due to timing but these are also markets that saw stronger price growth. And then, conversely, you had stronger volume growth in some lower priced markets. So, just it begs a question around market share, some of these higher pricing markets, have you seen a share shift and how should we expect or contemplate market share over the next several quarters in some of these stronger markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I don't know that we would \u2013 or that I would call that as a share shift. Based on it was really where those shipments where and look, for example, in Alabama and Arizona, those are driven by very large highway projects that we booked some time back. And so, I think the impact is really \u2013 of those two, is timing of big projects, same thing was impacting California, and Virginia was weather.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Thanks.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Garik, I don't know if it's what you're \u2013 if it's exactly what you're asking, but the kind of mix impact we had on recorded average selling prices this quarter, we would expect to be fairly transitory. I mean you know this, it's that our higher price markets are the ones that have higher long-term growth. So, longer-term, if anything, mix should probably help us a teeny bit.","But in the quarter, we had a set of markets that \u2013 by the way, they all grew. So, 80% of our markets that had growth around \u2013 had pricing growth around 4%, they grew at 9%, we just had some of the lower price markets like Illinois, Alabama, Arizona grow at a higher rate. They all grew, but we just had a little more growth in markets that on average, have prices, $5 \u2013 $4 or $5 below the higher price markets.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today will comes from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. My question's on transportation cost. I mean how much of a headwind was the distribution cost in the quarter? And I heard you say that the headwind was behind us. Can you just provide some color on some of the basis for that?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, it was two things. We had talked about the \u2013 our port in Houston that was silted in from the hurricanes. We suffered from that second half of last year, we got that dredged in the first quarter. The two things, you have the cost of \u2013 excuse me, got it dredged in the second quarter. There were two pieces of that cost. Number one, you got the cost of dredging; number two, in the first and second quarter, you're still going into the light loads and partial ships which is very inefficient. And then, we had some \u2013 still had some barge costs go up and down the Mississippi that we were fighting. And I will tell you that, as we said, those costs are behind us and we feel really good and really confident about how we enter the third quarter.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm talking more about the trucking-related cost to your distribution yard \u2013 sales yards, sorry.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I don't think that's what we were referring to when we talked about that. We were really referring to more of the Blue Water than trucking costs.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","The biggest place we had elevated distribution costs related to our businesses, and this is in the quarter, related to our businesses in the Gulf Coast of Texas. So, I think, Houston and along the rest of the Gulf Coast. That's really where we saw most of our elevated distribution costs in the quarter. We have higher trucking costs, but again, given that we report freight-adjusted pricing and other factors, that's less of an issue in the numbers that you see.","I would note, it's a little bit of a different topic, but just on the Ag U.S.A. outlook, and what I mentioned on rail there, in terms of distribution headwinds and logistics headwinds, for that business, we still see a $50 million EBITDA contribution for the year. But that would have been higher if we had the kind of rail service we'd like to see. We're probably full-year looking at being nearly 500,000 tons below what we would have otherwise been in that business.","So, if anyone's wondering why we're not raising our outlook for Ag U.S.A., like you might expect, that's really the issue. We're super happy with the acquisition, still going to contribute $50 million as we laid out. But going to take slightly longer to capture some of those synergies that we would have hoped to have captured this year due to the challenges we're facing in rail service. Now, we think those will get worked out, but still a bit of a challenge.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","To your point on truck \u2013 on trucking, usually that adjusts very fast.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, on your guidance, you said in the full-year guidance, your \u2013 you think the top end is less achievable. Can you just maybe provide some direction whether you're tracking towards a low end or the midpoint?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We would say, we're tracking to the midpoint. And again, not trying to set off any alarm bells or anything, just trying to be realistic. We've got a $20 million hole in our Asphalt segment relative to our beginning-of-year expectations. We've got diesel headwinds relative to beginning-of-year expectations of, let's call it, $15 million.","And to reach the equivalent of what would have been $1.275 million (00:52:00) even with stronger shipments is just tough. So, it's not that it's impossible, given the shipment strength we see. We just wanted to be realistic and tell you that the high end of the range, the $1.250 million (00:52:13), given those headwinds in diesel and in our Asphalt segment economics, it does get a little bit tougher. And so, to be clear, we really didn't want you all to take the strength in our shipments, which is very real and powerful, and just move right to the high end of our range, because those headwinds we've seen in diesel and in liquid asphalt, so far, are a real thing.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, are you seeing any project delays in any of your key markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Every one of them is different. I think with California, we saw some that may be a little bit delayed, but they'll come on this year. We've seen \u2013 continue to see some \u2013 they're not delayed, but there was slower shipping on the 85-400 job in Georgia. But, actually, they have gotten approval and that has cranked back up. So, for the most part, we're in where we thought we'd be as far as timing of jobs, and in some places, probably a little ahead with them people trying to push new funding through.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, no project delays and no trucking logistics headwinds. That's what I'm hearing?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","With the exception of California, and we talked about that moving from Q2 into Q3 and Q4, I think that's probably accurate. Now, I'm sure there are some projects out there where we'll \u2013 I don't know what goes on in every one of them, but for the most part, I think that's an accurate statement.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We had some...","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And your capital allocation...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We had some delays in the first half like 285-400 but that's \u2013 I wouldn't let that be too big a distraction. When you get back to guidance range, I would remind you and everybody, we're shipping more than 900,000 tons a day right now. So, it doesn't take a lot to ship a couple million dollars from one quarter to another, and that's just something we should all be aware of. Just so we don't mistake short-term stuff for the underlying health of the business. Just, you can think about that math. But if you were asking the question, why our range is still as wide as it is, that's really a big driver of it.","And where we would, we're able to get the work done as evidenced by our shipment growth rate in the second quarter. But if we had a big major disruption like another hurricane event, it does take longer to catch up. That's really where we're seeing some of these trucking constraints and logistics constraints come into play. Is if you get a big massive disruption, it does take a little bit longer to catch up.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, final question, your capital allocation priorities, and \u2013 is there any potential here for a share buyback?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think those \u2013 our priorities really haven't changed. And we've talked about those a lot, but when \u2013 that's \u2013 we'll always look at that.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think, obviously, we take a lot of factors into consideration, and certainly, share price is one. But as we've been doing, we will make those decisions and report them out in the following quarter.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We remain very committed to our investment-grade credit rating. We would expect to finish this year in a leverage ratio within our 2% to 2.5% range. So, I'm not telling you what we'll do or not do, but there are multiple factors of which the share price is one.","Operator","Does that answer your question?","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Moving along, we'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks for...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on \u2013 just two-part question around some of the diesel issues. And just, A is, just a little more clarity around timing of what the guide assumes for new diesel surcharges or other price hikes.","And second, I guess, related to your comment about the implied economic moat. What are you seeing around \u2013 like are you guys tightening up your shipping radiuses? Are you seeing competitors tighten up shipping radiuses as a way of combating the diesel? And how's that kind of affecting the local market dynamics if at all?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Let me take the diesel first. And as I said earlier on pricing, we're already pricing up to offset diesel costs. And those are our production costs and how it affects the quarries themselves. So, that's already happening, it'll take a little while to flow-through. As John said, a lot of times that takes six months for work to \u2013 once you book it to port to ship.","As far as the moats are concerned, what drives the moats is just increased freight costs for someone to come closer to you. And it just allows you to \u2013 as when you price, so let's say, five miles away two years ago versus today, that moat got wider and your prices go up. So, that's kind of as simple as that.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And I guess, just relating to that, though, more specifically, if you've seen kind of competitive activity already be affected by that in some of your key markets? Is that enabling some of the stronger growth that you're seeing just effectively less competition in certain markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","No. I think there's plenty of competition in all of our markets. The moat really affects price. And I think that \u2013 but also, you've got to remember, and this kind of goes back to the fundamentals of price increases, is visibility to coming work is really \u2013 underscores and underpins price increases. And that's just not in the Aggregates business. That's from contracting Asphalt, Concrete, the whole \u2013 across the whole construction change, that's really what drives the price. And as those \u2013 as that public demand has joined in, that is very clear, there's no question that that's coming, and it allows people to \u2013 more confidence in raising prices.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And my second question just relates, and sorry to harp on price a bit here, but...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","It's all right.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...I'm just trying to understand the second half guide and you guys talked about it a couple of different ways as far as what the true like-for-like pricing is. And so I think, throughout that, it was 3% to 4%, and 80% of your market. So, when we're looking at the price guide for the second half, what would you say as far \u2013 is the mix impact in the geographic mix impact in your second half pricing commentary? Is it the same, has that \u2013 is it diminishing as some of those, like the California markets, come back just trying to get at really what the underlying change is there?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","The way I think about it is, to try and cut to the chase, we obviously build this bottom up as we look at it. So, I don't know that you'll see exactly the same kind of mix impact that you saw in the second quarter overtime, but we'll continue at this rate of growth. And we're growing shipments 10-plus-percent as we did in the second quarter. When you have that kind of rate of growth, you're a little bit, just as a mathematical definition, a little more prone to mix shifts. So, good, bad, sideways. So, I wouldn't try and read too much of that.","To help you, we're expecting in the second half year-over-year price improvements in that 3% to 4% range, in that range of about $0.40 a ton on a same-store basis. Just to give you a rough ballpark. And what I'd really underscore is continued further improvement in our quoted pricing which will further benefit late this year and into 2019.","So, there'll be more momentum probably in our quoted work than you see on our shift work, per Tom's comments. But think something on the order of $0.40, 3-ish percent, 3%, 4% in the mix. It's going to be what it is. We don't try and \u2013 the last thing in the world you'd ever want us to try and do is to avoid shipments in order to improve the average selling price. So, I hope that helps, but it's a positive story. And it's an acceleration, not a deceleration.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think, important to note, we're pushing prices across all geographies, across all product lines. And so, when you \u2013 and so John said, when you talk about a mix effect, what happened in the second quarter, nothing \u2013 there's nothing bad with that. In fact, it's healthy and good. We simply sold more product in markets like Alabama, Arizona than we expected. That's a really good thing. And as you look at it, we're always going to maximize all the products in all geographies at the best price and margin possible.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We don't mind if you ask any questions, you're not going to ask any questions any harder than Tom's asking the operator. So...","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful, guys. And certainly clear in terms of your conviction on the way forward so thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today will come from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Morning, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, one more on price. I'm sorry, but are you \u2013 would you say you're the pricing leader out in the market or are you seeing others push major (01:01:51) prices also?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","(01:01:55) I think that what you're seeing with pricing is pretty widespread, that's what we're about. And, again, I'll go back. That volume confidence and the visibility to, particularly to the public work coming in, is very good for pricing and that's good for pricing across the construction material segment, whether that's contracting Asphalt, Concrete, and all Aggregate product lines. So, it's pretty widespread and that is really healthy and it's pretty consistently moving up in the vast majority of our markets.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And the dynamics vary a lot market by market. Though, I think people will tell you, we typically play a price and value leadership role over time.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, I wanted to ask about \u2013 we've seen a lot of \u2013 year-to-date, we've seen a lot of multiple compression for these Aggregates names. Maybe people worrying about the cycle getting long in the tooth. I mean, are you guys seeing any signs that were late cycle instead of something else?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think if you look at where we are in normalized demand across most of our markets, we're still well below it. If you look at the underpinning drivers of demand, the private side, both res and non-res continues to be healthy. What we had suffered with and last year was the lack of flow-through of highway work, as we've talked a lot about that's really pulling through. The thing that we've yet to see is the flow-through of non-highway infrastructure.","I would tell you, we're on the cusp of that. We're starting to see that today in places like Florida, as it catches up to what's going on in the growth in res and non-res and that will be exciting to see. So, it's a much smaller segment of ours. But \u2013 so, at this point, in the vast majority of our markets, we see steady, continued growth particularly with the onset of public demand.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We're well more than 50 million tons short, a little bit more than that of where we would expect to be in this cycle, our views on that have not changed. The numbers I gave earlier, about just the amazing performance of this business, this franchise through the recovery so far. It's about half way through the recovery in terms of tonnage in our Ag segment.","And again, I think most people on this call understand that's still more than another 50 million tons below peak volumes from the asset base we have today. So, we, like others in the industry, would still see a multiple-year recovery ahead. And one that allows for really good compounding of unit margin improvements through time. Which I think \u2013 certainly, we, but I think many others in our marketplace are very, very focused on.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck, John.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. You're expecting...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","...double-digit volume growth in the second half, which is certainly a nice acceleration. And it sounds like you're expecting good momentum heading to next year. So, just curious, how should we think about the growth trajectory going into 2019 and is this pace sustainable?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'd look at it this way. I think going to 2019 \u2013 and we've talked a lot about this \u2013 the private side continues to be healthy, particularly in our markets. What you'll \u2013 and we've talked about this a lot. I think what you're going to see is that compounding effect on the highway demand as funds mature and that's compounding within a state like Georgia as the DOTs mature and are able to get work out, and they're not going to wait on one job to finish to probably put another one out. And then, you'll see the compounding effect between states. So, places like Georgia or Texas or Florida which have very, very good growing highway programs will be complemented with the onset of maturing DOTs and money flowing through shipments in places like South Carolina, Tennessee, and California.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And while it's too early for us to give any specific numbers on 2019, in our markets, we like the steady growth we see in residential. As we all know, that's \u2013 there's plenty of demand. That's really still a supply-constrained marketplace. For our markets and our business, we still like what we see in private non-res, just what we're booking in our backlogs. We always keep an eye on that marketplace. It has got the benefit of some of those energy projects that Tom mentioned as we look to 2019. The highway transportation Tom just talked about, that's a really good outlook for multiple years.","And we've actually just recently begun to see, and it's very early, but the first signs, really, the first signs of some improvement in what we call non-transportation public infrastructure, water systems, airport systems, schools, other things like that. And so, it'd be very encouraging if we see that continue. That's really been a laggard in the recovery so far.","So, a very positive outlook. Again, we don't think we'll run into capacity constraints relative to our shipment plan for this year. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Could we sustain growth at this quarter's 11% all the way through the recovery? Somewhere in some markets, we'll run into some capacity constraints. But again, as others have said, aren't ours, but just relate to largely logistics or our contracting customers.","We've been very encouraged, and you've heard Tom say, and we pointed out what's been happening with construction employment. So, I would say, keep in mind, at least as it relates to Vulcan markets that for this last two-year period where we had disappointing public shipments relative to expectations, everybody saw the same expectations and they continued with construction hiring in our markets. So, that's \u2013 some of that capacity issue is a little bit alleviated right now because of the hiring pattern we've seen in our markets over the last two years.","Operator","And it looks like we did lose our caller. We'll take our next question in queue from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Morning, Stanley.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for fitting me in. Hey, quick question. All else being equal when we think about kind of the mix impacts you've thus far this year, looking into next year, given what you see in your backlogs and the quoting activity, is regional mix a positive or a negative, kind of thinking about those expectations?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'd kind of go a little bit back to mix. As long as you're selling increased volumes in any market, is always good because you're just adding more margin to the bottom line. And as always, we do those from the bottom up. It's way too early for us to tell where we are. If you look at what's going on with highway programs in markets like, I mentioned Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, California, those are all very good margin markets and play into our strength. So, I think it really boils down to margins.","And so, you see the volumes going up, that can only help cost particularly on the private side \u2013 I mean, on the public side because it's a better mix of how \u2013 you have better sales mix with that and it matches your production mix better. So, that helps price as does the volume \u2013 helps cost as does the volume, we've talked a lot about price, you put all that together and it's really why we're so excited for the second half of this year and 2019 because those margins will just grow.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And still I think cost one (01:10:00) is really the main one, which is it doesn't really matter economically. That's, by far, the most important point. But from a headline reported number, as we get into next year and we put a slide in here and the stuff that you can see, Stanley. But you know that Alabama and Illinois, which grew 14% in the quarter in our lower price markets, those are not our fastest growing markets long-term. We've called that out over and over again.","Our teams up there are doing a fantastic job running those businesses, but they don't have the same long-term visibility that almost the rest of our footprint has, at least not yet. So, and the distribution cost that affected pricing in places like coastal Texas \u2013 you heard Tom say coastal Texas is rapidly turning in those dimensions. So, in total, we'd expect what you got next year is an easier comp in the second quarter, if you will.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no. I think that's fair. I think that that was kind of the line of questioning. I think there's a lot of momentum in some of these other states that should help from a mix perspective.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Absolutely.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And thinking about next year, right, I mean, so if you guys are down to 2 times to 2.5 times by the end of this year. You have some of your growth CapEx rolling off in addition to what should be very strong earnings. Your \u2013 has it \u2013 is M&A still kind of at the forefront and\/or maybe what are you seeing in terms of opportunities out there? And then part of it, too, kind of goes back to the repurchase piece, right, because I think that there's a disconnect seemingly with the stock with the visibility that I think you all have and then kind of what's been happening here as of late.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I would sum up M&A right now, as I usually do, with discipline but a little bit different twist. We're going to remain incredibly disciplined in terms of M&A. I think our focus right now is capturing the synergies of acquisitions that we've made. As always, we'll be very, very selective. But we're working real hard to make sure that throughout this year and 2019, we capture the synergies of the very strategic growth projects that we've entered into and make sure that we're capture \u2013 have that going into 2019.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Stanley, I think you're kind of getting more to the core of the issue. But \u2013 so, thanks for the question. You're right, growth capital \u2013 internal growth capital should be a lower number next year. We had a bump up this year, really, again, as you've heard me said before, just because some projects would have been 10-plus years in the making, it made sense to turn on right now.","New quarry in California, new quarry in Texas, for example. So, our cash flow profile should continue to improve quite significantly and it creates a lot of flexibility. So, we wouldn't expect that our cap allocation priorities change at all. But there's a lot of flexibility particularly as we get into next year. And it's something that you can tell we're very focused on as a management team.","We've often laughed, this is a good problem to have. And we're going to work hard every single day to keep making it a bigger problem to have. So \u2013 but our cash flow profile has benefited a lot from tax reform, it's benefited a lot from the embedded leverage in the business. You're going to continue to see some of the really good growth investments we've made over a number of years mature. So, they're not done with their contribution, they're continuing to improve. And so, again, a lot of flexibility in 2019.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect guys. Well, thank you very much. And John, best wishes to you. I'll be looking for you in five years if we get off the 62% incremental.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","All right. All right.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm just kidding. All right, take care.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen our final question today will come from Scott Schrier with Citi.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning and thanks for getting me in on this call. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much of your backlog might be comprised of these delayed projects that where price a long time ago and how long we might see that for? And then, I guess, as you think about, right now, we might have the propensity with labor for some more project delays, what kind of measures do you take to account for the potential for delays and pricing mechanisms for the future in your current bidding?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I would point out, we've got a number of very large projects that we're shipping. I don't know if they've been delayed now. At this point, we're shipping most of those. They'll ship throughout this year, may have a little bit go into 2019. But what's really important is the work you're bringing on is at much higher prices. And so, that mix will flow out over time. It will take balance of this year probably a little bit into 2019 to do that. But everything you're adding on is at higher prices. And we like the way that flows go and you can see it our backlogs and you can \u2013 it supports our plan for the second half of 2018.","As far as labor constraints, we don't have any labor constraints. John talked a little bit about this year \u2013 about this earlier where we saw our customers with volumes basically flat, grow their labor over the last two years, and they're reaping the benefit of that. If I had to weigh that, I would say, the private, which is more labor-intensive, could have some constraints. The public shipments, which are coming on strong, I don't see those constraints, not that they're not there to catch up, but on a day-to-day basis, unless you have, as John said, a big event.","John also mentioned logistics with some headwinds, with rail and potential some trucking at times. But we think those are getting fixed. We got to work through them. But \u2013 so, pricing, as we've talked about, continues to flow through at higher levels. And I don't see a big impact on labor unless, as John said, we have an event and you're playing catch up.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, last question. On Illinois, which obviously has been a challenging market and it looks like you lumped it together with Alabama on that slide to show pretty significant year-on-year growth. And to John's point that you don't think that maybe that's going to be sustained. I'm just curious, was this quarter an anomaly or do you see some better growth or just the demand environment in Illinois?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think what you see in Illinois is a big project work, really driven by airport and toll ways. But we have some good backlogs to that. We will see some continues with that. The problem with Illinois is the DOT is obviously grossly underfunded and has issues with state budgeting as funding and has funding issues. So, with the exception of big projects which I think our folks have done a good job and is right in our wheelhouse, the fundamentals there are tough.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for that. And, John, best of luck to you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom for any additional or closing remarks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes. Thank you all for joining us today. As you can tell, we're very pleased to see public demand kick in and our highway really kick off. We're seeing the benefit of that and we'll see it for years to come. We talked a lot about pricing. That jump in demand is driving price increases. And as time goes on, we'll continue to see that. All of this, coupled with really disciplined cost, disciplines and enhancements will drive margins. We're exactly where we thought we'd be right now in the year and we're on track for our full-year guidance. And we look forward to talking to you throughout the third quarter.

Welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Jessica, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide on this call, we will focus on the highlights.","Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, Mark, and we appreciate you joining us for the call today. We had a good start to the year. Our first quarter aggregates volume and price were consistent with our expectations and we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year.","Three points stand out. One, we are where we need to be to deliver on our plans and projections for the full year. Two, market conditions continue to improve nicely across our footprint, including California, and demand just keeps on building. Three, we're finding good opportunities to grow our asset base and further strengthen our customer service capabilities. These investments in growth reflect our strong confidence in the sustained recovery and continued acceleration in our profitability.","Now, let me expand on these three points. Regarding our good start in the first quarter, I'm pleased with our operating results and with the quality of our execution. Aggregate shipment rates for the quarter were encouraging, particularly given weather in California and the comparison with Q1 2016 when we were up 17%.","Excluding California, aggregate shipments were essentially flat with the prior year. California shipments were down 20% in January and February due to record rainfall before beginning to recover in March. The continued recovery in demand across our Mid-Atlantic and Southeast states helped offset the effect of the two-month decline in California. Taking into consideration the season and California floods, our first quarter shipments were in line with full-year expectations.","Now, when the weather finally improved in California in March, business immediately improved. Aggregates pricing also continued to improve in the quarter, with an average freight-adjusted sales price up $0.57 despite modest headwinds from product mix. Our fixed plant price increases have been duly well accepted. Some of this went into effect January 1 and some April 1.","We realized higher average prices across nearly all of our states. We completed the first quarter in line with our full-year plans on price and on volume.","Aggregates segment total cost of sales increased $0.69 per ton. This included some $14 million of higher cost associated with diesel, stripping, the California floods, and the dry docking of one of our ships as we transition to new, more efficient vessels.","From an operational perspective, our core unit profitability in Aggregates, which leads the industry, continue to improve again in line with our full-year plans. Our non-Aggregate segment also performed well in the quarter, beating last year's strong comparisons.","I want to point out the quality of execution that creates results like these. We're serving our customers well, providing solutions as well as product so that they stay with us for the long haul and we keep growing our customer base. We're investing in the business and building new skills for our people, with particular focus right now in our sales teams, the same time we're controlling our operating costs. And most important, we are continuing to maintain a safe work environment.","For example, last year, we had our second best safe deployments in the history of the company, and Vulcan has always been an industry leader with a strong safety culture, but that ain't good enough. This year, we're off to an even better start with a meaningful reduction in accidents. Hereto, we are keeping the focus on taking something that's good and making it better every day. The engagement, discipline, commitment and attention to detail that underpin our safety performance also say a lot about the strength and quality of our people and our overall company performance.","Stepping back from the first quarter's results, let me expand on my second point. Market conditions continue to improve in very important fundamental ways. At a macro level, as the Dodge data clearly shows, the pre-construction project pipeline keeps getting bigger and bigger. Construction starts also have continued to recover from last year's weaknesses. Generally speaking, we're continuing to see solid recovery in private construction activity across many markets.","As one indicator, you may want to note the 22% rise in our concrete shipments in the first quarter that was driven largely by higher levels of private construction in Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. This is our largest concrete market and a major added position for us.","On the public construction side, we are getting ready for multiple years of increasing demand in our key states. While the federal highway bill, the FAST Act brought stability, visibility and increased funds for the nation's highway systems, many of our key states and cities have stepped up to address their own needs. For example, last month, California and Tennessee passed major transportation funding legislation and South Carolina is on the brink of passing a new highway bill.","California's $52.4 billion transportation bill, SB 1, is a game changer for that state. And remember, Vulcan is California's largest producer of aggregates and asphalt. On top of that, local ballot measures passed last November in California added another $1.2 billion annually for transportation projects for years to come. This was primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where we have the most strategic aggregates and asphalt positions.","Tennessee's new highway bill will bring in $350 million annually, helping tackle a backlog of more than 900 projects valued at $10.5 billion. And South Carolina is on track to ultimately add $630 million annually for roads and bridges.","Vulcan is the number one producer of aggregates in Tennessee and South Carolina, and also the largest asphalt producer in Tennessee, with strategic locations throughout the growth quarters in both states. As you know, Texas, Florida and Georgia all have made significant increases to their funding programs in recent years, raising their highway programs to record levels. Other Vulcan states including Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland have also increased their highway programs.","Altogether, key Vulcan states that make up 77% of our total revenue have significantly increased their highway funding. And more such legislation will pass in other Vulcan states, along with more local ballot initiatives. The need is just that great.","Now, obviously, these funding measures add significant value to our business. They will extend and amplify this recovery. They improve long-term visibility and they foster additional economic growth across our footprint","Our customers are getting ready for the next wave of large public transportation projects slated to start later this year. We will be the primary supplier for many of these large projects. Projects like the 202 Loop around Phoenix, Highway 281 expansion in San Antonio, the I-285\/400 interchange in Atlanta, and the widening of I-20 in Atlanta and I-85 in North Carolina just to name a few.","We will see significantly increasing public infrastructure demand in the coming years. The trend is clear and the laws are written. All of this further enhances the great value of our franchise.","Now, let me touch specifically on California, given the importance of the changes that have occurred there. We've seen market conditions improve dramatically. Private demand in California continues to strengthen, driven by both housing and non-residential construction. And, of course, the outlook for public construction in California improved substantially with the passage of SB 1. Near term, this legislation removes recent uncertainty about public road funding and allows Caltrans to move ahead with planned work this year. In the intermediate and longer term, we should benefit from a much higher level of public construction activity. This is in a state where Vulcan is the largest supplier of aggregates and asphalt.","Just as we've seen in Georgia, the improved visibility to future demand in California will also reinforce a pricing climate that is already much improved. California looks in many ways like Texas did four years ago. Overall, construction activity and materials consumption are still well below long-term trends. The private economy is growing, residential construction is rebounding, there's new legislation supporting strong public road construction and maintenance, and the conditions are in place to support significant price and margin improvements for years to come. We're excited about our prospects in California and we expect to continue investing there accordingly.","This brings me to my third point, our acquisitions and growth investments reflect our confidence in overall market conditions. They also reflect our confidence in our local leadership and execution. Just in third quarter of 2016, we closed on six bolt-on acquisitions. These add to our strong positions in California, Tennessee, and New Mexico. Now, putting this together with the 14 other acquisitions and swaps we completed since 2013, these acquisitions expand our ability to serve our customers, bring important operational and commercial synergies, and strengthen our platform for sustained growth. We're excited to welcome these new operations to Vulcan.","We will continue to pursue assets and operations that fit our strategy and our portfolio, and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of the right acquisitions. Putting it all together, the quarter represented another good step forward toward our longer-term goals.","With that, I'll hand it off to John, who will share a few more details regarding the quarter and outlook. Then I'll follow with some closing remarks. John?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you heard Tom note, first quarter results and market trends were very much in line with our beginning-of-year plans and we are reaffirming our full-year outlook for adjusted EBITDA of between $1.125 billion and $1.225 billion.","I'll now comment on a few specific drivers in our core aggregates business. With respect to aggregate shipment volumes, we continue to see a sustained recovery in progress, with rising public demand gradually complementing private activity that has driven this recovery so far.","The outlook for continued growth and shipments across our core southeastern markets remains positive and encouraging. And California shipments appear to be catching up on volumes lost due to weather early in the year.","As you know, quarterly comparisons get easier as the year moves on. Ultimate shipment levels and growth rates for the balance of the year will depend in good part on the timing of deliveries to anticipated large projects, particularly large public transportation projects. Again, the question here is one of timing, not trend.","Moving now to aggregates pricing. Again, we came out of Q1 with pricing in line with our full-year plans. Nearly all states realized price increases, with Georgia and California experiencing double-digit gains. Our reported average selling price for the full year may be pressured a bit, as it was in the first quarter, by product mix, but we currently expect the underlying like-for-like improvement to be in line with our beginning-of-year expectations. The overall pricing climate for aggregates clearly remains positive.","Turning to Aggregates segment's profitability, I'll note that nothing has changed regarding our full-year outlook or for that matter, our longer-term goals for Aggregates segment unit margin improvement or flow-through rates. Most of the $14 million in costs incurred in Q1 that Tom mentioned were anticipated in our full-year plans.","Looking ahead, we expect the lull in volume growth that we've experienced over the last 12 months to be behind us soon. And we think it's worth noting that both our business and the markets we serve have taken important steps forward during this time. I'll briefly run through a few examples starting with our core profitability.","Average aggregate selling prices are $0.71 per ton or 6% ahead of where they were at this time last year. Our cash margin per ton in aggregates on a trailing 12-month basis reached a record for the first quarter despite the cost headwinds mentioned earlier. And our downstream asphalt and concrete operations generated $23 million more in trailing 12-month gross profit than they did a year ago.","In addition to improving our core profitability, we've made important additions to our asset base. Since the third quarter of last year, we've invested approximately $230 million in six strategic bolt-on acquisitions and we expect the run rate EBITDA contribution from these operations post full integration to exceed $35 million.","Our financial position is also stronger. We've returned to full investment grade ratings, we've begun to extend the duration of our debt portfolio while reducing our weighted average interest rate and we've maintained the flexibility to fund smart growth investments.","And of course, our markets have moved forward also. California's transportation funding uncertainty has been resolved. Tennessee and South Carolina are joining other Southeastern states in matching a continuing private recovery with significantly higher levels of public investment.","FAST Act funding and projects have moved that much closer to impacting our daily material shipments, and visibility and confidence have further improved especially when compared to the overhang of last year's election cycle.","So to recap, we've seen significant steps forward in our core profitability, our asset base, our financial flexibility, our visibility to public construction demand and in the growth outlook for our California operations. For all these reasons, we feel good about reaffirming our expectations for 2017, about the continued recovery in materials demand beyond this year and develop Vulcan Materials' unique positioning for sustained long-term growth.","Tom, back over to you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, John. I think it's pretty clear that we're excited about what we see ahead of us, and I can tell you we're ready for it. The clear trends we see in growing public and private demand align well with our unmatched strategic locations in our key states and with our recent acquisitions.","I want to point out that we have been busy growing our company. We are stronger and better positioned now than we were a year ago. We have the best employees in the industry and our teams are just getting stronger. We are investing in them as they gear up to meet growing demand.","We are set up extremely well for continued strong profitability, earnings growth and free cash flow. We are at a point where we should see meaningful period-over-period growth rates, particularly in the second half of this year. We are especially encouraged given the great and growing strength of our core Southeast franchise and the return to growth in California.","As I travel around the country and met with our customers and local leadership teams over the last quarter, I found them more confident and upbeat than I've seen them in a long time. And I share their enthusiasm and their energy.","As always, we remain focused on creating value for our customers and are running our operations with a relentless focus on safety and continuous improvement. We are also focused on creating superior shareholder value now and for the long term. That's our commitment. That's what we do.","With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. This is actually Marshall Mentz on for Bob. Congrats on a strong quarter.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks.","Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, clarifying question on your guidance. Given the California public spending tailwind and the $198 million of acquisition spend year-to-date, were either of those benefits included in your original guidance? You obviously had some headwinds in California that you needed to overcome, but how should we think about that range in the context of those two tailwinds then? You had a comment about $35 million of contribution from spend over the last several quarters for the acquisitions.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Right. This is John. I'll take it to start. Of course, we're reaffirming full-year guidance. But within that, on California, we expect we'll be able to catch up on the shortfalls we've had earlier in the year.","California, as a business, is performing well. The shipments are beginning to recover quite quickly and we think we can make up for some of those cost impacts elsewhere in the business throughout the year.","On the M&A front, the new acquisitions we've talked about today for the current year, for the 2017 year, probably have a fairly marginal impact on the order of $10 million to $15 million above what we've already included in our guidance. The $35 million number I mentioned would really be at full integration, full run rate. You might think of that as more of an 2018 number. We'll obviously talk about that more as we hit closer to 2018.","So not a big adjustment from either of those factors to our current guidance. Certainly in the context of our total EBITDA expectations for the year.","Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, if I could give one more in. Just on California, you guys have obviously spent a lot of time on it. I know it's an important market for you in spite of the historical funding situation. How much does the state currently contribute to your top line and how high do you think that contribution level could move given the spending tailwind? And any bolt-ons that you may \u2013 you added one this year, it sounds like, and maybe that increases the emphasis on bolt-ons in that state.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll start again, and Tom will probably chime in. California, as I think many on the call know, has always been one of our most important states. I think it's running about 16% of our revenue.","One thing that Tom mentioned that worth emphasizing, of course, is we're the state's largest aggregates producer as well as the state's largest asphalt producer. And so, a good bit of our asphalt segment is focused in California also.","So the changes that we've seen in state funding in California, very important to us long term. In the short term, we hope they'll free up Caltrans to release some work, both new construction and maintenance, that's been held up a bit due to funding uncertainty over the past 18-plus months.","But it's really a positive story as we look to 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think on the short term on the private side, we've seen the non-res pick up. We predicted that the second half of last year and it's coming true. As you travel in California, you can see the confidence in both the contractors' eyes and in the ready-mix producers on the \u2013 so \u2013 and the res has been healthy.","On the private side, I think last year was a matter of timing and location of jobs. We're seeing those jobs kick off this year and more jobs in our footprint. So, both of those will play well for us in 2017.","And as John said, I think Caltrans was just frozen because of funding issues and that's been broken and they'll be freed up to let jobs. So despite the rain in California, when the sun came out in March, shipments picked up immediately. Actually, the flooding \u2013 well, it postponed demand, it didn't do away with it, but also really created some demand.","There are some washouts in some roads and still some road maintenance that's got to be fixed from the flooding, which will help both aggregates and asphalt.","Marshall Mentz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Very helpful. Congrats on the excellent quarter and good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Morning, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Morning. Thank you for taking my questions today.","First is more asphalt-related, you picked up the LoJac assets in Tennessee, an asphalt construction firm. How does Vulcan think about asphalt acquisitions as part of its longer term strategy? And following along with that, knowing that California and Tennessee \u2013 you have the largest asphalt and aggregate positions in those state, what is the breakout of highway construction as a percentage of your total sales in each of those states if you are willing to share that today? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. The first part of your question, I think whether it's asphalt or concrete in an acquisition, it's really not about vertical integration; it's about how do we look at the strategic position in an individual market and also how does it fit with our aggregates business.","So, both of those, it's really an extension of our aggregates business in a market where it fits us. So we have the leading position in aggregates in Middle Tennessee. We have done business with this asphalt customer for 20-plus years. We knew them well, they knew us well, and it was a very good strategic fit for us.","So, again, it's about the individual markets and the strategy in those markets and how does it fit our aggregates-focused strategy, which is \u2013 as always, our business is grounded in aggregates.","As far as the second part of your question, that is a significant increase in Tennessee. Tennessee's roads are asphalt-driven and in places like Nashville, the biggest city in Tennessee, we all have the most strategic positions and the largest positions. So we're looking forward to paving more roads in Tennessee.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Would it be fair to say that the highway construction post acquisition in Tennessee and in particular Southern California is 50% to 60% of your total mix in those respective markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","That's probably a little bit on the high side.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","High for current. But it could grow to that, Kathryn, conceivably.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. It could grow. Yeah.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think what we'd say is that \u2013 because, obviously, we're set to preserve the full market. But the acquisitions we've made \u2013 it's not accidental that we've made these acquisitions to end markets that have had significant step-ups in public funding. And as you well know, some of the asphalt post-aggregate positions, in particular, match very well with public road construction, whereas sometimes concrete can be a bit more private construction-driven. So, we think it's a really good fit and it's a really attractive deployment of capital for us when you're starting with a really attractive strong aggregates position.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Helpful. Tom, you had mentioned California looks like Texas four years ago. You've also mentioned in prior calls primarily last year that Texas is the only state where volumes are back to normalized levels. Where do you think California is compared to normalized level given that SB 1 and how long will it take to get back to normal levels based on your prior experience in that state?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Right now, California is probably 20% below normalized levels. As I said earlier, the private side is \u2013 continues to pick up steam. We're really pleased with the non-res.","SB 1, it's phased in over \u2013 about a four-year timeframe, but it takes that road spending from $3.75 billion to average of about $9 billion, so over a doubling effect. And it will much accelerate the road to normalized demand, but it also will probably up the average aggregate consumption in California over time because it's such a big deal and such a big impact.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Right. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just to build on that California highway bill impact. So, you said the doubling of highway and road spend. So, is it fair to assume that your business could double over there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, it would double. It would go on long ways to double the public side of it. Now, the private side continues to be grower and we think it, too, is still well below normalized demand. But the highway piece of the public side, it very well may double that.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then, on the...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Now, you've also got to remember where that money will be spent is in the very high population areas of California. And Vulcan, both in aggregates and in asphalt, has the most strategic positions in the big cities like San Francisco or LA or San Diego.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then on Texas, last year, is pretty weak. You're expecting growth in 2017. Can you just provide us some update on what you're seeing so far in the year?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. I think North Texas continues to be healthy both \u2013 in all sectors and you still got population growth in Texas. Now, we did say it's the one state that's probably a little at or above normalized demand, but you've also got population coming into Texas.","So, North Texas is very healthy. South Texas, we're seeing good growth in all sectors, particularly in San Antonio in asphalt, concrete and in aggregates. Houston and coastal Texas really had a tough time in 2016. We think we'd hit bottom and\/or coming up out of that. So we expect to see some growth in coastal Texas.","Summing it up, I think Texas is \u2013 continues to chug along and be healthy.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Rohit, just to add one thing just because it's topical. San Antonio just passed, I think, its largest ever bond offering for public infrastructure investment this last week, I want to say, $800 million worth. And that's just another good example of the kind of very local funding activity that's also happening. It doesn't get the same attention, but it's very important to the kind of local operations that aggregates players and asphalt players like us tend to have.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So very good news. And the visibility that you've seen in Texas over time, you saw pricing there, we think the visibility that we now have in California should over time help reinforce the pricing climate there also.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Fantastic. And just another topical question. Atlanta market, the I-85 bridge collapse resulted in a freeze in non-emergency-related construction. Georgia has obviously been a good grower for you guys. How do you think about the second quarter in that regard? Construction is frozen and could be unfrozen by June. And is that enough time to make up for \u2013 within the current April and May...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I don't think we're worried about the freezing of funds. You had the highway falls in and you had the buckling of I-20 also in Atlanta.","Now, the Georgia DOT is in really good shape. We've got six jobs that will kick off this year or have kicked off already. The total tonnage on those jobs is probably over 5 million tons over a two- or three-year period. So, Georgia and Atlanta, the public side is very healthy, a lot of jobs is kicking off and you're just now sort of starting to see both the FAST Act and the increase in Georgia DOT funds turning to aggregate shipments.","So, we're not worried about that. It's a short-term issue. This is a long-term game with the Georgia DOT and the private side continues to be very healthy. Our position in Atlanta is second to none; in fact, by far the best. And so, we're really looking forward to good things in Georgia.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, that's all I have.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thanks and congratulations on the quarter. Had a question just on your comments around mix in pricing and some of the headwind experienced in the first quarter and perhaps to temper expectations for the full year. Can you provide some color as to what the mix impact was? Was it more product or was it more geographic?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. The mix that I think really stood out was more product. It was more fines. It was more fines in the Southeast with new construction. Which we always say we'll take every day of the week. It's volume that in the past, when the downturn hit, we wouldn't have had. It serves our product mix and production mix out of our plants and just adds to our profitability. So, while it may appear to be headwinds on price from a profitability standpoint, we'll take it every time.","John?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'd just say, Garik, I think it's marginal. It's just \u2013 and I don't know that we'd want to temper expectations and certainly don't want to unintentionally communicate that the pricing climate is anything but positive. But as we see more new construction, more new large construction in the mix, it could, just from a product mix point of view, have a little bit of a negative impact on total reported average selling price.","Now, as we've discussed many times, on a profitability perspective, it should be quite positive. So, more a heads-up than anything where we're trying temper expectations too much.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And would there be any mix impact from geography as California accelerates in the second half of this year? And as it sounds like coastal Texas is trying to come back against relatively easy comparisons, recognizing that these are two high price markets.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, I'd tell you. I think that when you look at that, maybe a little bit, I'm not sure it will have a big impact. I think one of things we've seen in California, which we're very pleased with, and we said this, we saw marked price movement last year in California. And the demand improving on both the public side and the private side will only continue to move prices in California both in hot mix and in aggregates.","So, we're pleased with the pricing environment in California. Same thing with Texas. It continues to have a healthy environment. But as far as mix is concerned, maybe a little bit. I would more look at margin and I think we will continue to grow our margins in both of those states.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Garik, in California on a price and margin basis action, this is part of why it's kind of parallel to Texas from three, four, five years ago is that's a set of markets where margins have some room to grow. It is not one of our highest margin markets at the moment and it really, for a lot of reasons, ought to be one of the higher ones. So, we think there's some room to go over time in that and the visibility on the public side will help.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Which I would tell you four or five years ago, Texas had a long way to go.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Wonder, just to switch to the $14 million in higher costs in the first quarter, recognizing that this was according to plan, but should we think about it as a pull forward of costs from the rest of the year and what would this mean for the implied incremental margin performance as we get into peak construction season?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll start and maybe Tom will chime in. The first thing I would say is that, again, full-year guidance unchanged. And what I'd emphasize on that, Garik, is that the implied gross margin percent improvement from our guidance, both in the Aggregate segment and as a total company, we still expect. We still see that in our internal projections. So again, nothing's changed and we'd expect on a full-year basis to have gross margin as a percent of price-adjusted sales increase in the Aggregate segment and increase on the total company basis.","The cost items are the ones we mentioned and called out. They're real costs, not things that we would adjust out of EBITDA. But the impact is transitory. And particularly the impact on reported unit margin or reported margin as a percent sales. So the timing of those costs relative to the timing of associated revenue is what gives you kind of obviously a decline in first quarter margins when what we still very much expect is on a full-year basis and increase in margins.","So, a little bit of a pull forward, but mostly what you're seeing is the timing of those costs somewhat distorting the view on our margin trajectory, which on a full-year basis we still expect to be improving. Again, that includes the Aggregate segment and the total company.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think as important as the cost is what did the things we spent the money on set us up for. We're going to see some big projects with high lumpy demand kick off in 2017 and then you'll follow up in 2018 and 2019 as these FAST Act and state DOT dollars flow through.","When you do that, you got to be ready. I think that our folks, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, have worked really hard to get our plants in good shape. We got the people on board. I think that they're ready. We are also, I think, working hard on the efficiencies in the plants to things that really drive cost, things like throughput through a plant or downtime or scheduling.","So, I feel really good about the position we are and the firepower we have and our plants being ready both in aggregates and in asphalt and ready-mix to handle some big work that's going to come out of FAST. And this is also real high-spec work so you got to be not only have the firepower, you got to be accurate. But I think our folks have done a really good job over the winter to get us ready to come out of the gate strong.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And, Garik, if I can, just one more comment on diesel in particular because it's a significant drag in the quarter. But our average diesel cost in the quarter was roughly in line with what we expected. I think it was about $1.79. We expect it to go up in terms of our projections a little bit more in the balance of the year. I think we're expecting a full-year cost for diesel of around $2, let's say.","But in terms of being a drag, that would be kind of weighted to first quarter. Last year, diesel price in the first quarter was really at its low point. So we took, if you will, more of that hit in Q1 that we'd expect to take in the balance of the year.","But on diesel, as we've said before, higher diesel prices generally support higher aggregates prices, albeit with a bit of a lag. And they tend to widen, Garik, because you know the kind of natural economic moat around individual quarries just because the transportation cost goes up. So, with the \u2013 even in intermediate term view, we don't see that as a threat to our business and one could argue it's actually an advantage to our business.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Makes sense. Thanks again.","Operator","We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","On aggregates pricing, your pricing guidance for the year, are you contemplating any mid-year price increases and are there any markets where that could be possible?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. So we saw the 5% in Q1. We've had price increases that, as I said, kicked in January. We'll have some more \u2013 we had some more that kicked in April 1 and probably a little more this year that kicked in April than we had last year. And then on bid work, we'll bid projects throughout the year and you'll see those prices continue to rise as the year goes along.","As always, pricing momentum is a function of visibility and confidence. As I said in my comments, as I travel around, people are excited. People are confident and you can see it. They talk a lot about the jobs that are coming.","Let me give you a little bit of geographic flavor on that. If you've started on east with the Mid-Atlantic, last year, Virginia was pretty flat particularly on the private side. We've seen the private work in the fourth quarter pick up dramatically. You saw it. You heard it in my comments and saw it in our numbers on our ready-mix business up there, which is really a good sign going forward that the non-res and res is kicking in. And we just had that election lull in the Mid-Atlantic and we've got the good highway work up there.","Virginia, those dollars that they passed a few ago were kicking in. We've got big widenings up on I-95. The Southeast is really humming right now. We see the private construction work continue to gain momentum, particularly in the Carolinas and Georgia border, and Tennessee. And now, we're seeing the big highway work kick in.","We talked a lot about the Georgia work, the Carolinas. We see big work and again, this is the FAST Act coming through and this is the states increases and funding start to flow in the shipments of stones. So, our private work in the Southeast is really ramping up. Now, you're seeing the public dollars flow through. And this is really good for us because, remember, we are the largest producer in the Southeast and we have the most strategic positions in those growth quarters.","We talked about Texas, it's healthy. The coastal piece we think has bottomed out. Now, as I said earlier, California looks like Texas did four years ago. You've got the private work ramping up. The non-res we saw lull last year and it is coming back, and we saw it come back in March. And now, you've got the Caltrans dollars coming. Now, they won't flow through for a little while, but you've got pickup in Caltrans' fundamental work this year and then that really helps our asphalt business.","So, if you look at all of that growth and all of that visibility, it leads to a really helping pricing climate not just for 2017, but for the foreseeable \u2013 actually for the long term 2018, 2019, 2020. Our customers and the general construction market, knowing that that work is coming, allows everybody to take a little risk and just raise the pricing across the segment.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's great. I appreciate that comment. Then just lastly on the outlook for acquisitions going forward, there's chatter of potential large deals out there. I'm just curious whether now is the right time to look more seriously at a large deal.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","The M&A pipeline continues to be very active. As we always say, this is about discipline of the projects that we completed fourth quarter last year, first quarter this year. We've been working hard for a long time, but we're going to be disciplined about the markets we look at.","They have to be \u2013 growth markets will be very disciplined about what synergies are unique to us and everything does not fit us. We'll be disciplined in what we invest. If it's too expensive, we're going to walk away and we'll be disciplined. It's really important in the capacity and the speed to integrate these things.","I think that our growth team is quietly doing a excellent job at this. I'm very proud of them. They're not going to stop now and they're working really hard at it.","The acquisitions we got, you see it fit us well. We're integrating them I think effectively and quickly. They are in markets where you see substantial growth in public funding with the private side being healthy. They also \u2013 some really talented people we got with those and we will welcome them to the Vulcan family.","So, we look at a lot of acquisitions. We look at a lot both very large and very small. But again, we're going to be picky about it because it has to fit us on all kinds of ways and we have to be good about integrating. So, like I said, pipeline is healthy. We'll continue to plug at it. And whether large or small, we're going to look at them and we're going to analyze them.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Thanks again, Tom.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think a lot of people don't realize, but we're always working on this. And we've done 20 acquisitions since the recovery began. So this isn't really new news for us. It's just always working at it, always being disciplined and it's just \u2013 we've got great organic growth, great organic margin expansion. It's just a really important strategic complement and something our teams that drive this have done a great job of for a while, but it's not really new news.","Again, we've done 20 external transactions since the recovery began. And on top of that, we have, we think, a pretty exciting set of internal growth investment opportunities, internally developed new railyard positions, new reserve positions or reserve expansions. They were also excited about, and that is a deployment of capital have again attractive returns. So, I'd say expect us to keep doing what we've been doing. And as Tom said, keep the discipline.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, John. I'll turn it over.","Operator","We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Incorporated.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Just a few quick questions. I guess on the California weather, a lot of focus on that obviously, but how should we be thinking about the timing of that coming through? Could we see it? It's mostly being achieved in 2Q. It sounds like activity definitely picked up there once the weather has started to cooperate. And I know that work's just kind of pushed to the right. So, just trying to figure out how quickly that could come back and any way to think about the magnitude of tons there.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","It came. It started coming back in March as soon as it dried out and that's a testimony to the work being there and people ready to go. So, I don't \u2013 I would tell you that it'll flow through fairly naturally. I mean, maybe a little bit back-half loaded just because you've got \u2013 you're running the bottlenecks with people and equipment out there on the road and now ready-mix folks can get out or lay down machines.","But I would tell you that it will flow through. A lot of that work, depending on weather, is going to happen this year. I don't think \u2013 depending on what happened, normal weather cycles in California will be fine, but it's probably a little back-half loaded.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And you gave us an impact, I think, to the cash gross profit from that rainfall on page 5 of the presentation. Any idea or maybe you could translate that for us into tonnage just so it can help us with our modeling?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, first of all, that's really not the impact of volume; that's the impact of the flooding on our operations and the cost to handle that flooding and the damage of that flooding.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Got it.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","So that was not an impact of business delay. It was an impact of pits creeks running into pits and primary has been flooded and things like that. As we said, volumes were down 20% in January, February.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Right.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","March started to return. So from an earnings perspective and volumes perspective, I think we're going to be fine in California.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And probably just to \u2013 again, just to be clear, that little bit of cost we put in there, as Tom said, that's just direct operating cost impact pumping flooded quarries, processing wet material. It's not the cost of, call it, lower fixed cost absorption, did lower volumes and it's not the cost of just the loss margin on absolutely lower volumes.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Okay. That is helpful.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We just want to give you what we could fairly directly see and measure.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Got it. And then, on the \u2013 Tom, you mentioned projects with high \u2013 I think you called it high and lumpy demand that will kick off in 2017. I know that you guys have kind of been tracking all of this stuff for a little while and those things can move around. Can you give us any more color on those projects specifically? I think you talked about some big projects in Georgia and Carolinas.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Let me just kind of run out kind of big projects by state off the top of my head.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","That'd be helpful.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","You got the I-85 widening in Virginia, which is about 1 million-ton job. We'll probably, and this is an estimate, do 400,000, 450,000 tons of that. North Carolina, you got I-85 widening, again that's 1.2 million job, which a third of it will go this year. South Carolina, you got I-85, I-385 interchange.","I mentioned the six projects in Atlanta \u2013 or in Georgia, rather. That's some 5 million tons and probably be 20%, 30% of that this year. These are all \u2013 this is work that's been booked and we're shipping. It'll start this year.","Texas, you've got a number of jobs. The biggest one is probably right now. You got \u2013 two biggest ones will be US 281 widening in San Antonio, which is 1.3 million tons. It'll start in the third quarter. We'll start shipping on that job in the third quarter. Job that has not been awarded yet is the Grand Parkway in Houston, which is \u2013 that's 1.5 million-, 2-million-ton job.","You've got Arizona Loop 202. That's over 2 million-ton job which we'll start shipping this year. And in California, you've got the Fresno, the Highway 180, which is bidding right now and it's a 1.5 million-ton job, so just to give you a little flavor. And those will \u2013 it's always with big work like that.","You'll have times where we will get real hot and then times where we will have a lull, depending on what was going on on the roads specifically on that job at the time. When I say lumpy, that's what I mean. They'll call you up and say you'll be shipping fast and furious for a month and then you'll slow down for two weeks.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. All right. Well, thanks for the color. Super helpful.","And then, I guess a little bit bigger picture, taking a step back and looking a little bit maybe longer term. With the pickup that we're seeing in a lot of your markets and the pickup we're expected to see over the next 12-plus months \u2013 12, 24-plus months, do you guys see any bottlenecks or capacity constraints either at the mine or even maybe downstream, which could limit or cap the activity in any of your markets, just as we look at the recovery and kind of the cadence of getting back to something close to normal for you?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll start with our capabilities. I think that as far as big jobs go, we've worked real hard to get our plants and our people in shape. We're ready to go.","Now, they're maybe in spot markets with certain clean stone sizes, you will see shortages of certain sizes. It's not a worry though. We have the firepower, we're not close to capacity and we'll be able to supply whatever comes at us, both whether that's aggregates or ready-mix or hot mix. And we've worked real hard with this over the last year to get ready because we saw this coming.","Now, when you move to the roadway, you are going to see some bottlenecks. You will see some labor bottlenecks out there with paving crews and ready-mix trucks and ready-mix drivers. And I think in a lot of markets, we will see that. And, at times, that will create bottlenecks they'll overcome on.","But again, you will have \u2013 we talk to a lot of customers and a lot of them are working really hard to get people on board right now and trained. I mean, new people because experienced people are tough to find out there. And a lot of our customers have really invested in their training programs to have folks ready to be able to pave these roads. It'll come and go with some shortages.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks for that, Tom, and thanks for sneaking me in here at the end of the call. I appreciate it and good luck with the rest of the quarter.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Scott Schrier with Citi.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","(56:26-56:29) taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more on California and I could appreciate the fact that there's not going to be much impact from SB 1 in 2017, but how much of that was embedded in your thought process given that it's still by \u2013 was by no means a shoo-in to past. It's been around for a while and barely past this time.","And then, alternatively on California, I was wondering if you could talk about the state and local measures. And what's the opportunity set in timing of things like measure and \u2013 which is the biggest maybe some of the other local ballot measures there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. So, as far as our confidence in SB 1, we said over the last two years, it wasn't if, it was when and the need was just that big in California. This is a parallel theme across many, many states and we've seen it many, many times. And actually, this is a parallel theme for the country.","There is a lot of public support for infrastructure spending and now there's starting to be a lot of political support for infrastructure spending. These are big plays in California, Tennessee and what's going to happen in South Carolina, they're almost ready to pass their bill. This will continue to happen across other Vulcan states and other states throughout the country, but it's also going to happen at some point in time on a national level.","Back to your question on Measure M, Measure M and which is in Los Angeles, is about $860 million per year. Measure B, which is Santa Clara County, is $210 million per year. And then the BART Bond is about $200 million. Total that up, that's $1.2 billion a year in just local funding on top of the $9 billion that moved from $3.75 billion to $9 billion in the state.","And the point is California's infrastructure system is broken right now, and we are very pleased that the public and the elected officials have had the wisdom and the foresight to do something about it because it will really affect their economy if they didn't. So, I'm not sure our crystal ball told us when it was going to happen, but we knew it had to happen.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I want to ask the cash gross profit question a different way. It looks like based on your commentary not accounting for fixed cost absorption, if I add that $14 million back, it looks we're at about 5% cash gross profit growth, 60% incremental margin.","To me, that sounds like it's really setting a floor for what the year could be. Is that an accurate way to look it at or are we going to have any more cost related to, say, the ships or stripping or that $0.28 you called out for labor and repair? Or should that really be not part of the equation going forward?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll start and I want to start again probably the most important point, which is to point you to full-year guidance because you can get twisted around in our business if you're trying to extrapolate just from Q1 unit margin numbers, given how low it is in volume and how low it is in total gross profit. And by the way, I would say the same thing if we had a blowout high number on one of these metrics in the first quarter. So just extrapolating from Q1 is just a little bit faulty to start with.","But to answer your question a different way, has anything changed about our view of 60% flow-throughs over time? No. Has anything changed in our full-year expectations for improvement in unit margins, whether gross profit per ton or cash gross profit per ton? No. Are we still on track with the kind of cash gross per ton improvements that tie back to our $2 billion goal at normal demand? Yes, we absolutely are.","Those things haven't changed. The conditions are in place. The pricing environment is positive. Our long-term cost control has been actually exceptionally good. And so, even though during the balance of the year and these were incorporated into our beginning-of-year plans, we will have higher stripping costs this year than we did last year. We do expect to have higher diesel cost this year than we did last year. It's not a surprise that we're transitioning in our ships and that'll have some cost, but those things we should be able to overcome in this environment.","And really, that continuous compounding improvement you've heard us talk about and the quality of execution that you heard Tom talk about, which is reflected in our safety metrics also, those are all things that give us confidence that if you were to look at it from our chair, if you look at the operating metrics the way we're able to look at them at a plant level, plant-by-plant, you'd basically see that we're on track with our plans. And those plans have margin improvement for the full year.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. If I can sneak one last one in there, you called out the 10% pricing in Georgia. I'm curious of how that compares to maybe some of those surrounding states in the Southeast, if you can talk about the magnitude of the pricing you're getting in those states.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll start. Tom may want to add. We try to call out a few sometimes to give you flavor, but we don't like to walk through pricing in an individual market, individual state basis too much probably for some obvious reasons.","One of the reasons we called out Georgia and California in addition to just having high pricing is really they're places where you have very good visibility. So, you've had the kind of public funding passed, you've got better visibility to forward demand, and you see that kind of growth.","I would say that price increases are widespread. They're widespread across the Southeast. I would say that they vary by degree, but that is much about a moment in time as the long-term trend. And the margin improvement across the Southeast, when Tom was talking about our core Southeastern franchise kind of humming, it's not just on the top line. It's really throughout the P&L. We like what we see. Those are very profitable well-run positions for us and we're excited about what we see.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","To add to that, places like South Carolina and Tennessee who have always had good pricing momentum for a number of years now, the visibility of those highway bills will only help that.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","What's really nice about that is those are long-term demand drivers.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And this isn't really a comment on pricing, but just to be complete, just make sure we're also calling out some of the slower places, if you will. Alabama, still a little bit slower in terms of demand. Mississippi, still a little bit slower. Louisiana for a cycle had a lot of large projects, so I don't know exactly what I'd read on that. We like the outlook next year there.","Tennessee has really started to improve quite a bit. We talked about that. Kentucky, still slow. Illinois, we talked a lot about, structurally a little bit slower, but I'll tell you our team there has done a great job driving profitability improvement in a market that doesn't have a ton of growth.","So, those are some of the places. If you wanted places that from an overall demand picture are a little bit slower, that we'd call out.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Congrats on the progress and good luck.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Hi, good morning. Good afternoon.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hey, Jerry.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","At your Analyst Day, you folks spoke about just the cadence of new construction starts driving weakness in the business in the back half of last year. And I'm wondering, based on your updated assessment of what you're seeing on the ground, have we turned the corner? In other words, how broad based is the visibility improvement that you folks are seeing now compared to six to nine months ago? Can you just flesh that out for us?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. As John said, I think for the full year, we're very confident in our guidance, maybe for timing of jobs and even the stuff we talked about California, maybe a little back-half loaded. We're off to a good start. And I think we're off to a good start not only on demand but also the prep work we've done to get ourselves ready.","Our markets are looking healthy. The private non-res side, which we talked about in Investor Day, that was coming is starting to flow through. We talked about that in California and the jobs \u2013 the big highway work, which is the FAST Act and state funding just beginning to flow through are starting. So, I think what we're seeing is what we predicted in Investor Day.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Jerry, the only big color I would add I think on the start data and kind of what we see on the ground is \u2013 and then I'll try and compare and contrast the year-ago.","A year ago, we were beginning to see some start activity weaken and it continued to weaken, let's call it, through July at least. What we're seeing now hopefully is the benefits of its strengthening since that time. And in Vulcan markets, as opposed to the country overall, obviously residential start activity I think is well-covered. People see that.","Private non-res start activity continuing to improve in Vulcan markets. I think it's down in non-Vulcan markets, but it's improving in our markets. We want to see that continuing.","Public transportation starts improving in Vulcan markets. So the trajectory is good. We want to see it continue, Jerry. But the trajectory is much more positive, if you will, than it would have been this time a year ago.","The one thing I'd say and you know this well I think, we will have a lot better visibility to that in our call about the second quarter. It's just will be that much further into construction season DOTs will be kicking off their new year. We'll actually see which projects are really moving at what schedule. So, I know it's awkward, but we just really do have better underground visibility when we next talk than we do right now. All the signals are clear.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And what...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","They will know more as we get little further into construction season.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And lastly, you spoke about the run rate for $35 million on the acquisitions that you've made year-to-date. Can you just talk about what proportion of that is synergies versus the underlying business? And then, the acquisitions that you're valuating from here, can you just give us a rough label for how much is that in new markets versus existing Vulcan markets?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll start and maybe Tom will chime in. And just for the sake of clarity, so when I refer to the $35 million of run rate, that's against the six bolt-ons we've done for roughly $230 million since the third quarter of last year.","A portion of that was in our beginning-of-year guidance and plan as we discussed in our previous call. I'd say there's probably $10 million to $15 million of additional EBITDA for the 2017 year that wasn't in our prior communications from these acquisitions. A lot of that will depend on pace of integration. But again in the context of our overall plan, it's not a major shift. But at kind of full integration \u2013 not yet full synergy probably, but full integration \u2013 we see contribution of about $35 million from those assets. That's an EBITDA number. And of course, we'd expect long-term growth beyond that initial run rate.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","As far as where they are, all of these are either in or adjacent to existing markets or there is, in the case of asphalt and concrete, extensions of our aggregates business. And so, they do a number of things when we get the right ones. They expand our franchise, they protect the franchise and they expand profitability. So we're very pleased with what we got.","Operator","I do apologize, his line is having an issue. I will go next to Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. Just a quick question, Tom. The comment about the California 20% below normalized levels at pretty big states, when you look at it kind of where you play specifically, are there even wider margins in that? Because I think about the Bay Area, which might be a little later in the cycle, and maybe Southern California isn't.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. The Bay Area is probably a little further in the cycle, but not a lot. And I'd say, as I said earlier, the marked improvement in how we're funding, which is more than a doubling over time, will raise the per capita average in that state just because it's such a big jump.","I think that as we look at it, again, California has all the pieces that Texas did four, five years ago. The private side continues to be very healthy. It would seem the non-res really started to kick in this year. Residential is healthy.","So, I think as we move forward, it will be a steady pace in California. It's not going to be a big jump and a part of that is also because these highway funds phase in, in about like $0.25 billion and then they work up over full-year timeframe. Actually over time, these continue to grow.","So, I think you'll see really healthy steady growth over time, which also creates a good environment for pricing and for improved margins.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And to a question that was asked earlier, we and the overall, call it, construction sector like the very long-term nature of this. You've heard us talk about a preference for long-term solutions in the federal side. The long-term nature of this helps our customers make those investments in additional capacity, whether that's staff or equipment, and it's a much better environment for us than I'm going to call out a one- or two-year stimulus type approach. We really like the long-term nature of this in California. And the funding sources are very predictable and it's just a very good resolution for the state and for suppliers like us.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. In terms of the growth in business development, kind of the way you guys are thinking longer term in nature, is California a market where there's a lot more room to grow in terms of acquiring quality assets and finding the right markets? I mean, it's kind of the big kahuna there already.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Well, California \u2013 and we work all the time hard on California, we made a number of acquisitions in California over the last four years, both in asphalt and in the aggregates business. If you remember, we also got out of the ready-mix concrete business and swapped it for asphalt assets in California, Arizona, which was a very good move for us strategically.","I think there are plenty of opportunities in California. You also got to remember with a big growing demand in California, there is a marked shortage of resources in these big growth markets. We've worked hard over the last decade plus to make sure that we permitted and grew our reserve base and have reserves for generations, not just for the short term. And with this big highway fund, that will put pressure over time on reserves from some of other folks in California and I think we have a very good position in these big growth quarters with long-term reserves.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you. Best of luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you. Listen, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. As you can tell, John and I and the team are very excited about what we see ahead of us, both on the public side and the private side, and we see those opportunities now stretching from California to the Sun Belt, to our core Southeast businesses, up to Mid-Atlantic.","So, we've got a great start to the year. We look forward to talking to you on the next call and update you on our progress on growing Vulcan Materials Company. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren you may begin.","Mark Warren","Thank you, Bridgette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.","To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental information. Rather than walkthrough each slide as we've done in past calls, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2016. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions.","With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state, and local funding for infrastructure and the highly competitive nature of the construction materials industry. These and other risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope you have had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As Mark mentioned, John and I will summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2016. Then, we will be happy to take your questions.","We remain highly focused on the fundamentals of our business at Vulcan, on the clear opportunities in front of us. Regardless of recent concerns that have swept through global securities markets, we are focused on the things that we control and on our improving profitability. We have made a lot of progress over the last year and we have a good report for you today.","Aggregates volumes are up nicely, pricing is positive, our gross profit per ton numbers continue to be really impressive. We are controlling our cost. But first, I would like to start the conversation by making three basic points. Number one, we finished the year strong. Our teams companywide are executing our aggregate focus strategy extremely well.","Second, I assure you that we will sustain this focus into 2016. We believe these efforts will result in more than $1 billion in adjusted EBIDTA this year. Circumstances obviously vary across our geographical footprint, but the gradual recovery and demand continues in each of our end-use segments.","Third, our performance throughout 2015 as we continue to move through the early stages of construction recovery, demonstrated clear and steady progress towards the longer-range goals and the expectations we put forth at our investor day last year. With very few exceptions, construction activity in the markets we serve still remains well below long-term trends. However, we are positioned for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth with strong conversion of those incremental sales to gross profit.","Now, I would like to go a little deeper into our fourth quarter and full year results. John will then hit the highlights of our 2016 outlook and I will conclude with some observations of our path forward.","Let me say up front, I am pleased with how we finished 2015. Our mindset at Vulcan is that we can always improve and we work hard on getting better all the time in every aspect of the business.","Shipments were strong in the fourth quarter whenever and wherever the weather cooperated. As we noted in our third quarter call, many of our customers have seen their backlogs grow as demand continues to pick up and as they face capacity constraints. We saw higher level of shipments on weekends and many of our customers were beginning to keep their crews on as long as the weather allowed. Those trends held up through the fourth quarter.","Firming demand and reasonably dry weather in California and Florida contributed to year-over-year shipment growth exceeding 15% in those states. Shipments in Georgia grew by 22% despite wet weather. On the other hand, shipments increased in the low-single digits in Texas. This was due to extremely wet weather in October and November. The underlying shipment trends in each of these states continue to be good.","In total, same store shipments for the quarter were up more than 8% in our aggregate segment, 4% percent in our asphalt segment, and 2% in our concrete segment. For the year, we shipped 178 million tons of aggregates. This is slightly above our midyear forecast of 177 million tons. And an increase of about 10% over 2014's shipments.","All in all, this was a very solid year of volume growth. Remember this is from an asset base that has delivered aggregate shipments of approximately 300 million tons. As we talked about before, we are still early in the recovery towards 255 million tons, which we believe represents a more normal mid-cycle level of shipments.","We have a broad base of demand both in terms of geography and end-use markets. We see each of our end-use markets continuing to grow. Some of our Texas markets are at the upper end of the spectrum of normalized demand, having enjoyed extremely strong growth. Most of our markets, however, are still well below normal demand and it should enjoy steady growth for years to come. We are seeing good growth on both coast with still a lot of upside.","Other individual markets in the Central United States, such as Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga are also continuing to strengthen. When you put it all together, the longer term shipment trends we focus on continue to look good across most of our markets.","Regarding pricing, we continue to experience a positive pricing environment in most of our markets. This is a result of three factors. First, we've invested substantial capital in the business to serve our customers and need to earn a fair return. Second, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the recovery. And third, the construction industry is increasingly focused on improving returns on capital as volumes remain well below normal levels.","Overall, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 11% on a same-store basis or $1.18 per ton compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. In the quarter, we estimate $0.15 per ton held from product and geographic mix. For the full year, average selling prices increased 7%.","Now, I would like to make a few remarks regarding our customer service and cost control levers. Throughout the quarter our teams did an excellent job meeting our customers\u2019 needs, including tight deadlines and complex demands on big projects both safely and efficiently. During the quarter, we saw improvement in repair and maintenance costs and overtime labor costs. This improvement contributes to our strong finish for the year.","Costs during the first three quarters of 2015 have begun to rise as increasing volumes required us to run our plants longer. This led to more repairs and higher spending on parts and supplies and associated labor. Now, I said in our last call, we are very focused on improving these costs and we are beginning to see these improvements in September. The improvements continue and I am proud of our operating people for the work they have done here.","We remain intensely focused on managing these costs efficiently balancing the factors affecting production quality, service, and cost. Still a clear picture comes with a longer term view, for the year, our unit cost of sales in Aggregates declined slightly as our employees remained focus on continuous improvement. We got better at controlling costs as the year progressed. We also saw reduced expenditures as diesel cost declined. Setting aside external forces, our strong emphasis on cost control near-term and longer-term will not change. Overall I am pleased with the progress we have made with our execution and our focus.","We continue to focus on customer service, employee development, cost control, and our safety performance. We saw marked improvement in our safety performance in the fourth quarter. Let me emphasize, this is a continuous improvement track, a process of working to get better every day. We have made good progress but there is still more to be done. A strong example of the progress we have made is the outstanding job our teams did converting incremental revenue into incremental gross profit. Flow-through in the quarter was 89% on a same-store basis, obviously strong result. But better look at it on a trailing 12-month basis where it was 77%, well ahead of the 60% threshold we target longer-term.","Our unit profitability in Aggregates continues to improve. Something our employees work hard on and can be very proud of. Gross profit margin on a same-store basis increased 38% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Unit gross profit margin was $5.38 per ton. This marks 12 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. We will continue this trend on a trailing 12-month basis unit margin increased by 29% to $4.38 per ton. Now there is a slide you have seen before, slide number 11. That covers this. And I would like to call your attention to it because it's impressive.","Here you will see that for the trailing 12-months, we shipped 178 million tons, 38 million tons more than the year prior to the start of the recovery. Aggregates segment gross profit for the year was $756 million or $398 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. So on 38 million tons of improvement, we have delivered almost $400 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.69 or 66% during this period. A 27% increase in shipments has been converted into an increase in gross profit in excess of 100%. ","Looking at 2015 as a whole, you can clearly see the benefits of our aggregate focused strategy. We have the assets and capabilities in place to service our customers. We have the focused execution to drive profitability and we have a very strong platform for continuing growth.","With that, I will turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?","John McPherson","Thanks, Tom and good morning to everyone. So, Tom just highlighted and as you've seen in our release we had a strong finish to a strong year. A year with same-store Aggregates shipments up 7%, Aggregates pricing up 7%, strong conversion of that incremental revenue into incremental gross profit, improved material margins in our asphalt and concrete businesses, and continued leveraging of SAG to revenues. We expect to see much of the same in 2016, another year of continuous compounding improvement in our execution and in our results.","To complement the information shared in our release, I will first offer a few comments regarding the demand environment, then outline our performance expectations for the year and briefly note our plans for capital allocation. As Tom said, we see a broadening recovery and demand across each of our end use segments and across most of our geographic footprint. In total, we see demand across the markets we serve growing approximately 7% with some upside potential based on the rate at which rising DOT budgets and public infrastructure funding converts into active construction projects and material shipment.","We project private demand in the markets we serve to grow approximately 10% year-over-year, supported by growth in both residential and non-residential activity. We see continued double-digit growth in residential construction across our footprint with non-residential construction continuing to expand albeit at a slower pace than 2015. Although certain measures of private non-residential construction suggested some decline in the second half of the year, our on the ground view indicates continued solid growth.","And importantly, employment data and other macroeconomic and demographic factors further signal a sustained recovery in private demand across our markets. Much has been made about the potential impact of lower oil prices and we continue to monitor trends in private construction activity in markets such as Houston. But to date we have not seen a materially negative impact when looking at our portfolio as a whole.","I will now turn to public demand where we see 2016 being something of a transition year and in a positive way. Across our markets, we expect demand growth tied to public construction of approximately 5%. Longer-term visibility with respect to public demand has improved markedly with the passage of the federal Highway bill, state-level funding initiatives and record levels of local tax receipts.","In addition, the public construction share of tax receipts remains at 20-year lows and at ultimately unsustainable levels. This shift to higher levels of total public funding combined with greater visibility should allow for a higher percentage of new construction in the mix, which bodes well for our materials demand and in our case product balance. All of this is good. But at this point, we don't see the full benefit of these trends impacting our volumes until 2017 and beyond. We will monitor the lag between DOT budgets rising and a commensurate increase in product activity throughout the year. But to be clear, rising public construction activity is beginning to kick in with the question being at what pace?","Finally, we continue to see the overall rate of recovery in many markets constrained by construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks in the total construction supply chain. Although the situation can inhibit the overall rate of shipment growth in the near-term and lengthen the time required to return to normalized levels, it does provide further support for disciplined increases in pricing, margins and ultimately returns on capital. ","So against this backdrop of approximately 7% total demand growth in 2016, what do we expect to deliver in terms of financial results? As we've stated, our 2016 guidance is for between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBIDTA and approximately 25% increase over 2015. We don't give quarterly guidance as you know and we encourage investors to consider longer-term trends in addition to quarter-to-quarter results.","I will now comment on certain of the factors and assumptions underpinning our annual guidance. You should consider these figures to be mid-points of current Management expectations and keep in mind that our results vary widely across the individual markets we serve. Starting with aggregate shipments, we're projecting a total of 191 million tons or an increase of 7% over the prior year. On the geographic basis, we expect the growth in 2016 to be relatively widespread with higher rates in markets such as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Southern California offsetting lower than average rates in markets such as Texas where we see continued growth but at a slower rate than the Company as a whole and Illinois where we project a small decline in year-over-year shipments.","And as with 2015, we may see a greater share of shipments occur in the second half of the year in part due to the impact of El Ni\u00f1o weather on our Western States and in part due to the expected flow of large project activity throughout the year. Again as Tom noted, the overall pricing climate for our materials remains positive and constructive. We're entering the year with good momentum and we currently expect freight adjusted average selling prices for aggregates to increase 7% in 2016 in line with the increase seen in 2015. Please keep in mind that pricing decisions in our business are made locally with wide variances by product type angiography.","Our local teams will continue to balance pricing, customer service, operating efficiencies, and the overall sales and production mix all with an eye toward improving total unit margins and earning a fair return on capital employed. These shipment and pricing expectations of course suggest mid-double digit growth in freight adjusted revenues for the aggregate segment. We expect to continue converting these incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at a 60% or higher rate.","Consistent with this view, we expect gross profit in the segment to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year. And we expect to realize continued improvements in our per ton margins. We also expect to see continued profit improvement in our asphalt and concrete segments following on the strong gains posted in 2015. We currently project gross profit for these segments combined to increase approximately 20% in 2016. These operations are well positioned to benefit from the continued recovery and demand due to improvements to our asset portfolio, as well as our internal operating proficiencies.","Our current forecast for SAG is 295 million, approximately 3% growth over 2016. We plan to continue to leverage SAG to sales even as we make important investments in our sales and customer service capabilities. Administrative headcount should remain essentially flat year-over-year. So to recap, we expect to see in 2016 much the same of what you've seen in a very positive 2015. As well as through the entire early stage of recovery so far. Our people at all levels of the organization are focused on helping our customers grow, controlling what they can control and driving continuously improve results for our shareholders and other stakeholders.","Now, I will conclude with some brief remarks regarding capital allocation. Our aggregate centric strategy and the way we manage it day by day is geared toward generating significant amounts of pre-cash flow even in periods of depressed demand. That's by design as you\u2019d expect and we give it a great deal of focus. Our priorities for allocating that cash flow and managing the inherent cyclicality of our business has not changed from those we've outlined at different times over the core course of the last year or so.","In short, we intend to balance three objectives; reinvesting in the business for productivity and growth, maintaining adequate financial strength and flexibility, and a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. With respect to reinvestment, I will note that we plan to allocate approximately $275 million of cash this year to what we call core CapEx. That is reinvestment to sustain and improve the performance and productivity of our current operations.","In addition, we expect to invest a meaningful amount in growth whether in the form of acquisitions, or the internal development of new production and distribution capacity. With respect to financial strength, and flexibility I will note that our debt-to-EBITDAR ratio is lower than 2.4 times. Refinancing activities during 2015 extended our decorations, while lowering our rated average interest rate. We do not expect to use cash in the near-term to lower our total debt of approximately $2 billion. Rather we have the financing capacity and the liquidity needed to fund smart reinvestments in growth such as those I just mentioned. And we intend to maintain that flexibility throughout the cycle.","Finally, we expect the amount of capital returned to shareholders to increase as the recovery moves forward. As noted previously, we expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings during the recovery phase of the cycle. We also expect to use opportunistic share repurchase to return additional capital over time.","With that I will hand the call back to Tom.","Tom Hill","Think you John. You've heard me talk about the strong year we had and the things we consistently focus on to deliver superior results. Ours is a long term business. We set long-range goals and work hard to get where we think we can be given our world class assets and people. We are pleased with our 2015 results and the way we are positioned for future success. We've made clear progress towards the goals that we set forth in our Investor Day last February and are very much on track.","We\u2019re on track to achieve $2 billion in EBIDTA at normal levels of demand. We\u2019re on track moving steadily towards a normalized demand level of 255 million tons per year of Vulcan aggregates. We\u2019re on track for continuing gradual recovery in each major end market and in most of our geographies. We now have a fully funded long-term Highway bill and we are very pleased to see healthy increases in state and local funding for highways and other public construction.","We continue to anticipate aggregate segment cash gross profit at normal demand in the range of $8.25 per ton. This will be the result of solid sales execution, continued growth weighted towards our more profitable geographies, pricing fundamentals that continue to strengthen, and consistently strong incremental margins. At normal demand levels we also see greater profitability in our non-aggregate segment in the range of $175 million. Here we benefit from continuing operating discipline and improvements.","The strength in portfolio that came with our asset swap in 2015 and improving materials margins. We also remain on track with SAG costs moving towards 6% as a percent of sales. SAG as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points in 2015. We intend to further leverage SAG to sales growth. As we look forward we believe that we are well positioned for several years of double-digit topline growth, with strong conversion to the bottom line.","No matter how you look at this, I am pleased to tell you that we are executing well and that is the watchword of our people. Execute, execute, execute. Control your own destiny and finish strong. I\u2019m very proud of our people and the good work they are doing. I can promise you that we are all committed to making a good Company better every day. We are excited about where we are today and we are even more excited about where this Company is going.","Now if the operator will give the required instructions we will be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Good morning, guys.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Timna.","Timna Tanners","Thanks for all that great detail. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around what would comprise the range of your guidance. So, if you could speak a little bit about volumes and how much that might include deferred tons from last year's weather and talk a little bit more about color regarding Texas that would be great?","John McPherson","I don't think - when it comes to deferred tons in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit. But as you heard us talk about our customers and the sense of urgency, when the sun came out, when they are ready to work, whether it was weekends or evenings, they pushed a lot of work through. So, if there may be a little bit, but probably not a lot of deferred work from 2015 into 2016. Your second question was about Texas. I think that how we would look at Texas is obviously it's a very big state with multiple markets and multiple market dynamics. So, kind of breaking that down a little bit, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, West Texas all have very healthy demand growth that we think will flow into 2016. Houston and some of the coastal markets may have some softening in the private side, but overall I think that when you look at Texas it's still growing.","Timna Tanners","Okay, great. And the only other one for me if I could is, if you could talk us, give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of M&A opportunities in general and how receptive are the mom-and-pop's right now or do you think, new job geographies or kind of where you have been expanding recently as your focus.","John McPherson","I think, we continue to see opportunities for attractive acquisitions. The timing of that is always an unknown or question mark, just because when people decide they want to sell. I think the key piece of that is discipline - being disciplined in we buy, what we pay for and being very disciplined about how we integrate it into the Vulcan family. And we also have to be very disciplined and clear about the synergies that are unique to Vulcan and how we leverage them.","Tom Hill","Timna and John, I just a couple I could add on your question, first just to be clear our outlook for 2016 does not include the impact of any new M&A. It includes the impact of transactions already done, but not any new M&A. And if you're looking for things that could be kind of swing factors and volume, one we have called out as again how quickly this higher level of public funding for construction converts into actual shipments for us. That can be a little bit difficult to predict and so I think that's a swing factor we look at during the year. And apart from a lot of the attention Texas gets I guess we would just also note that for us we see a very much broadening of demand across our markets. Our demand growth in 2016 is really driven not by just any single state story. It's really driven by the entire portfolio and we think that's healthy for us, we\u2019re excited about it.","Timna Tanners","Okay, thank you so much.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Bob Wetenhall","Congratulations on a very nice finish two the year. I was hoping you guys could give a little bit of color, your incremental gross profit margin was off the chart, well ahead of what we are expecting, can you give us a little idea of how to think about that. Obviously you've got some terrific price, but you also called out mix. And then you mentioned there is aggressive cost control on repairs and maintenance and also a tailwind from oil. I just wanted to get a better framework for thinking about this and the likelihood of this persisting into 2016.","John McPherson","Bob it's John, I will start. As we always do we would focus here on the 12-month number not just a single quarter number. We think it gives you a good read. So, I would encourage you to look at the 77 for the year as a more meaningful number than any individual quarter. And we just think that's a better way to look at the business given the timing of how varies revenues and costs can flow quarter-to-quarter. Now if you, you may have already done the math, but you will see that our outlook for 2016 implies a flow-through rate that's above the 60% threshold that we see as a long-term number, but it's below the 77 that we did in 2015. A couple things we think about as we look at next year, one is that we expect to have higher stripping cost as we prepare for future growth. And those are items that are expensed in the current year, but they really prepare us for growth over multiple years. That's a bit of a factor we are considering in our 2016 outlook. And we are also keeping an eye on what happens with diesel prices throughout the year. So, we continue to believe that 60% is a very good long-term number. We expect to see something north of that in 2016, but I would also tell you and I'm sure Tom will echo this, we\u2019re really confident and pleased with how our teams are executed because that\u2019s really where the rubber meets the road in our business. Our local teams are doing a fantastic job and we expect that execution strength to continue into the New Year.","Bob Wetenhall","That's really helpful. I wanted to ask on slide 9, you had pointed out on the large improvement that you are getting in gross profit per ton. I wanted to see what you're kind of expecting working gross profit per ton climbed to the end of 2016 and what are your assumptions for the non-aggregates business in terms of volume growth. You laid out that 7% number for core aggregates. I just wanted to see your thinking on the non-aggregate businesses in terms of volume trends. Thanks and good luck.","Tom Hill","I will handle the non-aggregates. I think that if we look at asphalt, we look at volumes probably up in the high single-digit, low double-digit range. Concrete same kind of range. And I think we have with both of those, both concrete and asphalt we have a very good, like aggregates we have a very healthy pricing and margin environment with rising customer confidence and demand growth.","John McPherson","Bob, one more thing on the asphalt and concrete business before getting to aggregates profits. Keep in mind the asphalt business over time is really well expose if you will to increases in public funding, across many states. And so while the short term margin structure for asphalt can fluctuate, long-term returns on capital can be very stable and very attractive. Again tied to public funding, a little bit more on balance. To your point on aggregate margins per ton, first I will draw your attention to the longer term as kind of how we think about the business. As you heard Tom say, we think we\u2019re very much on track with the longer term outlook we put out at our Investor Day a year ago, which would imply on a cash basis per ton margins north of $8. And if you look and see what's happening in pricing, if you look and see what's happening in our operating leverage, if you look at our results so far through the recovery, we are at least on track with our long-term goal. I want to draw your attention to that because that's really how we think about it. In the shorter term for 2016, we continue to expect margins per ton to increase faster than the rate of pricing. So the year-over-year increase might be around 20% roughly maybe slightly below that. And again that ties back to a flow-through that is above the long-term 60% threshold, but a little bit below last year. So, we think it's a reasonable expectation, something we\u2019re confident our teams can deliver.","Bob Wetenhall","And if I could just sneak one in, on asphalt pricing it looks like it's breaking away from the positive trends in aggregates and concrete, how should we think about that into the end of the year?","Tom Hill","We experienced a very good year in asphalt in 2015. Our people will continue to do an excellent job of quality and service and provide value for our customers. Like stone, as I said earlier there is a really healthy pricing and margin story when it comes to customer confidence, backlogs, people have a vision particularly with the highway bill and asphalt. So, I think our folks are doing an excellent job of managing cost, material margins, while at the same time creating value for our customers. We would tell you and it's really hard to look at just price and asphalt, you really need to look at margin because of the fluctuations in materials cost, but we would plan to expand our unit margins in asphalt slightly of 2016 over 2015.","Bob Wetenhall","Great quarter, good luck. Thank you.","John McPherson","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms","Good morning.","John McPherson","Good morning, Trey.","Trey Grooms","Great year.","John McPherson","Thank you.","Trey Grooms","My question I guess would be around pricing. Can you talk about geographically where you guys are seeing higher pricing relative to, or price increases I should say relative to some markets may be that aren't as strong from a price increase standpoint. I know you said that most of your markets realize solid price improvement, but any color you can give us geographically on that?","John McPherson","I think, I would answer this way where we've seen the recovery more mature, those markets in general tend to be having a higher price increases and it's all about the environment, but across the footprint, we see good pricing environment with rising demand. The entire construction materials sector whether that's contracting asphalt, concrete, is seeing improvements in margin. I think people are really pressing that. And you've got customer confidence and good vision of what's going to happen. That vision is really helped by the federal Highway bill that passed. People know they've got five years offending. States know they've got five years of funding. So, I think as you see that that can only help the pricing environment. Our folks are working hard to improve the value that we bring to our customers. But overall, where we've seen the recovery a little more mature, we see better pricing environment.","Trey Grooms","Alright that makes sense. Thanks for that. As a follow up, how should we be thinking about the favorable product and geographic mix that we saw on pricing. I think you pointed out it was about $0.15 positive impact. Is that kind of a one-time benefit, I know it's not one time, but I guess the question is should we be expecting a similar type benefit as we look into the coming quarters and into 2016 being a favorable geographic and product mix.","John McPherson","Driving in the quarter some of that $0.15 was a one-time event and an example would be some very high-value product we shipped in South Carolina associated with some flood control. So, some of that we call out is a little bit one time. But what I would underscore is that even if you take that out our pricing for the year, the pricing trend we are on was actually still, a good bit above the 7% we had laid out for the year particularly on a same-store basis. So, I would think about the trend going into the next year, the momentum for next year on a percentage basis it's more like 7 plus as opposed to 11. Just because [indiscernible] period-to-period. Let me underscore one more thing, there is no deceleration happening on pricing. The environment is still positive construction and so what I would tell you is we have 7% in 2015, we expect 7% in 2016, we are entering the year we go momentum we have a lot of visibility to it and it is a pretty strong story.","Trey Grooms","Just one more from me on the outlook for private is up 10% and I think you guys said res being up double-digit. I think that implies still some pretty healthy growth in your outlook for non-res. Specifically what do you guys see and that gives you guys confidence that the non-res market is going to continue to improve with that kind a clip and also if you could give us any idea of what your mix is in heavy commercial versus or heavy non-res versus light in your non-res exposure would be great?","Tom Hill","I will start. I think we see and you said it steady growth in the non-residential sector included and embedded in our service is mid-single digit growth in non-residential. And while we've gotten some mixed singles, we've all got mixed signals about non-res construction with leading indicators, our outlook is very consistent with what we're hearing from our customers, with what we're seeing on the ground and what we experience day in and day out. So, I think we are quite confident in our non-residential forecast and it\u2019s steady. You said it best it\u2019s steady growth.","Trey Grooms","Alright, thanks a lot guys, I really appreciate you taking my questions.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim","Yeah, I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit just about your, whether you saw a strengthening relative to your expectations really kind of at the end of the quarter, at the end of Q3 for example, you didn't really narrow your guidance range and it came in above the high-end and if you set step back and see how things trended over the course of the quarter, is it true that things really exceeded your expectations at the end of the quarter and where would you say the greatest source of upside surprise was?","John McPherson","I will start. I think a lot of it had to do with great execution by our people, frankly. So, weather helped in a couple of markets. You saw that in the volumes, but overall weather was kind of a mixed bag in the quarter. Really, really wet and really, really warm. So, I think what we saw on the demand-side lot of what we would have expected, which is shipment patterns consistent with this continuing recovery and you heard Tom say when people are able to get work done, they did the work. But internally, the organization execution on pricing and margin management and cost controls in the quarter was excellent. And reflected strong performance throughout the year. We had challenged our people, Tom had challenged our people to finish strong and they did so. I don\u2019t think you see that reflected in our results.","Tom Hill","I would echo what John said, our folks are really focused on executing and finishing and they did that. I think what you also see is, we talked about this a lot that sense of urgency out in the overall construction industry and they are focused on execution and they finish the year strong and with a sense of urgency because they got work behind it going into 2016. So, they need to finish despite inclement weather at times.","Stephen Kim","Got it. That helps. Thanks very much for that. Now, I think you, from what I can gather from your comment on capital allocation it didn't sound like you were looking to - you were not including share repurchases in your guide, or in your outlook, I\u2019m just curious have you bought any shares back so far this year, that's basically the main question I had.","John McPherson","Well, obviously we haven't bought any shares back this year because we are still in the blackout period until today. So, you'll see in our financial statement the reflection of shares we purchased for the end of last year before the blackout purchase ended, fairly modest amount. I might well repeat what we've said many times, which is in the context of our overall capital allocation priorities, which of course include reinvesting for growth, include financial flexibility and include returning capital to shareholders. Within that context, we would expect over time to have some, when we call it opportunistic share repurchase. Complements the dividend, which we also expect to growth earnings and we will report on that of course every quarter.","Stephen Kim","So you don't have a 10b5 plan in place?","John McPherson","No. Not yet.","Stephen Kim","Okay John. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today.","John McPherson","Hi Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson","I have to apologize we had our power knocked out due to construction jobs in the Nashville area.","John McPherson","We like construction in the Nashville area. Sorry about your power.","Kathryn Thompson","It is what it is. It is more on the policy side, in your opinion when you look at that 22% growth in Georgia volumes how much of that was a assumption was normal weather versus seeing an early impact, the passage of [indiscernible] just from our numbers it adds an estimated $750 million fiscal 2016 and $820 million in fiscal 2017 in terms of incremental transportation revenues. Yes the reason we are getting in field is that yes there was certainly weather impact, but how much is with that volume also driven just by the passage of that bill?","Tom Hill","I will start with the weather in that I think it was - it's a little confusing because it was extremely wet in Georgia. Yet it was extremely warm. So, we got help with the warm weather, but got really - the wet weather should have hurt us. I think it goes back to the thing we keep talking about is that we had a number of large projects that there was a sense of urgency of when they could work they went to work. In fact would that sometimes use more rock because you've got to get out of the mud. I think that there is overall in Georgia, there is really solid underlying demand growth in all market segments. In every one of them and it's really healthy. I do not think that the increased highway funding in Georgia has started yet. In fact usually that takes 18 months to 24 months to flow through. Georgia is trying to accelerate that in fact as John talked about earlier, you could see more of that in 2016 then would be normal possibly but they've got to get that out there. But to answer your question, it is the impact of really solid underlying demand growth in all market segments not the improvement in the highway funding.","Tom Hill","Not yet because we share your view and longer-term enthusiasm with respect to the funding changes in Georgia. They were very long overdue. So we absolutely agree it\u2019s just not yet. I think what you're seeing now has been a long building improvement and a lot of private construction in Atlanta which Kathryn as you will know is one of the most depressed of all of the markets in which we operated in. We have a fantastic position and team in Georgia and so we're really excited about the outlook there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So in another words, a 75% to 80% increase in state funding [indiscernible] (50:16) haven\u2019t been really \u2013 there really is no impact yet for volumes?","Tom Hill","I don't think you were seeing that yet in the fourth quarter, maybe a teeny bit and we\u2019ll keep an eye on how much we see in 2016.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","Congratulations. A couple questions on pricing if I could. Your run rate exiting above the 7% average for 2015 and above the guidance for 2016. Just wondering why - just given the strength and pricing that we saw in the back half of the year, why wouldn't we automatically assume that the pricing guidance is conservative and John I think you alluded that it's a 7% plus view but what would take for pricing to trend maybe towards the low end of your internal expectations?","John McPherson","I will start, Garik. If trying to trend towards the low-end, per se we feel like we have very pretty good visibility on pricing side. Pricing in our business Garik as you know is a function of literally thousands of decisions made throughout the course of the year. So it's a little bit inherently harder to predict. I think if we were going to trend towards the lower end, unless something unforeseen happens, to some degree it would be a function of geographic or product mix. Some shift in that but we just don't see right now. But I would echo as Tom said, the conditions for that kind of pricing increase would seem to be in place. And therefore it\u2019s included in our guidance.","Garik Shmois","Okay. And then I guess you're not expecting much in the way of a big step up in DOT funding to benefit 2016 demand, it sounds like a 2017 benefit. But in the case there is some demand that comes through in the second half of 2016 from some new large infrastructure projects. Conceptually can help us understand how that might impact pricing if your business mix ends up skewing towards the start of new big Highway work?","Tom Hill","Couple of things. First of all, I think we do have increased funding in - DOT funding in 2016 maybe not Georgia or a lot of the \u2013 some Georgia but you've got a number of states that have huge increases in DOT funding that we have built in the 2016. Texas is one, they're going from 6.1 billion to 9.8 billion. Florida goes up substantially. We've got six or seven states that have already passed increased funding that will flow through in 2016. The big impacts on the Highway bill and as funding increases, we need to take another step in 2017 coupled with the state DOTs will start letting larger jobs with the visibility of having long-term funding. So as far as pricing is concerned, I think as it does flow through, it will be a mix of work on the job obviously asphalt prices tend to be the high in the spectrum basis low but I think it could possibly help prices but I probably tell it would probably be pretty neutral.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks.","John McPherson","Garik if history is in a guide, it should be positive for margins and overall returns. And again it's one more reason we keep getting people focused on the margin per ton line and not just the price line.","Garik Shmois","Got it. Makes sense.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning guys, congrats on the great quarter.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","John McPherson","Thanks, Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","You guys start off a discussion saying you\u2019re surprised of skeptical people are about the construction recovery. And then when you talk about double-digit revenue growth for multiple years, I mean that's something I would expect people to try to poke holes into. What would give you confidence in saying that about years beyond 2016?","Tom Hill","I think Adam one of the things that's been a real game changer for this is the passage of a long-term Highway bill and the passage in multiple states for long-term substantially increased funding. That gives us \u2013 that really gives us the industry and us visibility and it gives you a foundation \u2013 a growing foundation in the public sector of demand growth.","John McPherson","Adam, you need to look into it and understand of course that really with the exception of just a couple markets in Texas, all of our markets and our markets unbalanced are still well below normalized levels of demand. Construction activity has a long way to recover. It's not even driven by new economic growth. And at the levels we are talking about, we still have multiple years before we get back to 45 year trends of normal consumption. Mid to high single-digit shipment growth, a mid to high single-digit revenue growth if I can do the math correctly is more than double-digit revenue growth. And that's where this continuous steady rate of gradual recovery. Is it going to be a perfect straight line absolute linear quarter-to-quarter of course not? History hasn\u2019t worked that way, but history would also show that we absolutely recovered a normal and then in fact expand beyond that. So I think if you take a longer-term view, it's actually \u2013 it's not in fact it\u2019s anything conservative relative to history.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Thanks for reiterating that and then just lastly I wanted to follow-up on Trey\u2019s question. I think he was trying to get a breakdown of the heavy in light non-res being the work that we typically follow housing and then maybe heavy \u2013 maybe you can give us a sense for what your exposure would be at a big energy projects along the Gulf Coast.","Tom Hill","I tell you it's a good mix. With housing continue to grow, you will see the light follow that and it always does. We see really good housing growth in 2016. As far as the heavy, we still have substantial amount of projects along the Gulf Coast energy projects actually going into 2016, some in 2017 and some in the 2018. We've seen a few new ones start to look at engineering and permitting but that segment continues to be healthy whether it's refinery expansion, Port jobs, ethanol crackers, we still see substantial projects. We have - our outlook is very clear for 2016 and pretty clear going into 2017.","Adam Thalhimer","Great. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","Great quarter and great end of the year.","Tom Hill","Thanks, Ted.","Ted Grace","John, I was wondering if you could just step through either a gross profit per ton bridge or a consolidated EBIDTA bridge just so we can get order of magnitude kind of what the benefit in 4Q was, it's not hard to figure out pricing and volume but kind of R&M benefits, energy. We are estimating maybe $10 million a year on your benefit from diesel and aggregates alone. Could you may be just step through that so we\u2019ve got the data.","Tom Hill","Ted, some of it we can do off-line in more detail, but let me give the highlights kind of quarter and year. And as always I try and draw more attention to the year. But in the quarter you saw that our total cost of sales per unit declined and that was a combination of you said continued diesel benefit year-over-year roughly in the range of what you discussed. But unlike previous quarters we did a better job of managing our per ton expenses as of R&M and some other costs. So on balance we had a decline in cost of sales for the quarter and I think you saw that. For the year, we had a slight decline in total cost of sales and that was really diesel benefits offsetting some raising per ton cost that we commented on throughout the year in terms of R&M, parts and supplies associated labor with that et cetera as well as some overtime labor as we ramped up production. We are really pleased with execution we had in the fourth quarter. We are not taking for granted that all of those issues are behind us. We are still ramping up production and we are still well below what she would normally think of as the sweet spot of production levels in many of our plants. So it's something we're very much keeping an eye on and manage tightly as we go through 2016.","Ted Grace","Okay. And on a related basis if you kind of run rate current diesel prices, it would imply something like $30 million or so year-over-year benefit, just to mention what\u2019s baked into guidance or expectations.","Tom Hill","I think our current guidance, our current plans would have diesel prices rising slightly relative to where they are now. It might be something that I need to check hour by hour, the way oil prices have been moving. But we don't have a further decline in prices baked into our plan.","Ted Grace","Okay, great. The second thing I was hoping ask is just on SAG, a bit above our expectations in the fourth quarter. I know you highlighted kind of pension and profit sharing and some investment in sales. Can you walk through 4Q relative to expectations as we can appreciate that?","John McPherson","Sure. And I'll do it relative to the year too. So I wouldn\u2019t take, don't read 4Q as a run rate change, there were some accrual timing issues that made 4Q higher. So I wouldn\u2019t read run rate for 4Q. For the year, we ought to see a bit above our expectations, which is not something we are pleased with. I think for the year we executed better than we forecasted to be honest. So my comments on SAG, which is probably a number I would like to be zero as a CFO, but our comments on SAG would be that administrative headcount year-over-year remained essentially flat. So the core wage element of our SAG was well in control.","The variances were driven by fringes which is pension, payroll taxes, some deferred comp, calculations those kinds of things which we frankly just didn\u2019t forecast as well as I would liked to it at the beginning of the year. Some of those were driven a little bit higher with our rising stock price. We also had higher outside services fees and professional fees, those were legal and tax. And a couple other items associated with some changes we're making and some investments we're making on the sales side of our business. And then finally, our sales headcount was modestly higher in the year and our SAG is associated with that as we continue to invest in growth for the future. So again I think the execution was solid. We would like to see that number grow at more or like 3% than what we saw in the past year. We were to control it and we\u2019ll certainly continue to leverage it to sales.","Ted Grace","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Great quarter again and best of luck this year.","John McPherson","Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Todd.","Todd Vencil","Good morning. A lot of steps been knocked out but just a couple of follow-ups. I want to beat the non-reservoirs a little bit more just given that that's where a lot of investor concern has been focused and everything you are saying would seem to completely contradict and\/or a few lot of what I\u2019ve been hearing over the past few weeks from people on the other end of the phone. But you talked about some mixed signals from the forward-looking indicators and that doesn't jive with what you're seeing on the ground. Can you kind of help me think about how you put those two things together? What among the four indicators would look soft and have you seen any reflection of that, it doesn't balance out or you feel like the forward-looking indicators are suggesting softness or simply off-base are being interpreted wrong?","Tom Hill","I think you've got \u2013 just look at indicators you've got [indiscernible] who actually showed some weakness in Q3 and Q4. And then you\u2019ve got the construction backlog indicator by the Association of Builder Contractors, so the U.S. was flat before our market in the South was up about 15% for Q4. And then more importantly what we're seeing in our individual markets you still got solid growth in the non-res. I'll give you little flavor on that. If we looked at how you saw - if you sit here where we are non-res going into \u201916, we see that Atlanta will be up high single digits; Nashville up high double digits; Nashville up mid double digit; Phoenix low double-digit; Chicago, low double-digit; Charlotte 10% to 11%. So you've got a lot of cities and a lot of locations where there is still very healthy growth in non-res and trying to take an indicator on a national level is tough to put into our world where it's just local and we've got a good visibility.","Todd Vencil","Perfect. That helps a lot. And then on the public side, your comments about the fact that a lot of the highway stuff is going to kick until 2016. Georgia hasn't started kick in yet in terms of their states improvements and their transportation funding. Is there \u2013 would you think that highway growth in 2017 could be better than the growth rate in 2016 because of these factors?","Tom Hill","Yes. And I would tell you \u2013 I think that will continue to grow 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 out to the future as \u2013 because the Federal funding is compounded at 3% per year. And then you've got a number of states who have already - are already now collecting funds. Those funds will continue to grow in the future and as important as anything, then that work will start flowing through. As I said earlier, you've got normally you have unless somebody is really accelerated plans on the shelf, you've got 18 months to 24 months of lag time from collecting the taxes to shipping rock.","Now Georgia has announced publicly that they are going to be very aggressive about trying to turn work out in 2016 and I think they are working hard at that. We are pulling for them but it just takes time to do plans, get engineering, place bids and even get permits. So it will be and I said earlier this is a game changer for an industry and that you've now got a real visibility into the future for multiple years and you've got a foundation that is continuing to grow.","Todd Vencil","Got it. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone.","Tom Hill","Good morning","Jerry Revich","Tom, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the price increase for January 1 that you\u2019ve put through for 2016, how does that compare versus the price increase that was rolled out to start last year?","Tom Hill","I\u2019d tell you that it depends on the market. We really come back to this every time. We make literally thousands of pricing decisions every day. You've got some markets where we have January 1 price increases, you've got others that have a cadence of April 1, you've got others that have a cadence of April and October or January and July. So it's really all over the board and there's not just one price increase that goes out there.","I would tell you that from where I sit, I'm very confident in our 7%. That will be over quarter-over-quarter, month-over-month, that will be choppy and always is. But at the end of the day, like we told you last year, we were solid in the 7% and that's where we finished. So I think going forward, I think, as you look at it that the environment for pricing and I talk about this a lot because it's so important, customer confidence and improving visibility out into the future and rising demand is very important.","Jerry Revich","And as we think about the way the pricing cadence worked out over the course of 2015, like you said you built momentum over the course of the year, which was really the first time we saw that in this cycle. Are you thinking about the pricing cadence in 2016 lining up and similar fashion when rollup all of the \u2013 thousands of pricing decisions like you mentioned?","John McPherson","It's hard to predict because first of all you are comping over very different numbers. And so at this point, I'm not sure sitting here in the first couple of weeks of February that's really hard to predict, it could line up like that or you could see it be much more solid or much more steady through the year. It's just too hard to predict with only a few weeks gone in the year.","Jerry Revich","And then in terms of the Department of Transportation budget comments that you made. Can talk about year-over-year 5% growth, how much of that is based on their budgets versus what you're hearing from the folks in procurement and I guess what's the potential of that, we get projects started sooner relative to what's implied of 5% comment?","John McPherson","Again that 5% is a rollup of a lot of different markets, a lot of different DoT and even more local engineering segments of DoT, or districts of DoT. And our folks usually have pretty good visibility to that just because they spent a lot of time knowing what those projects are going to look like. As I think John said earlier, you could see some big DoT projects get pushed forward. And we would welcome that, but at this point and they're talking like \u2013 for example, in Georgia and a number of other states, there is a lot of talk about that, but we haven't seen it come to fruition yet and we don't count that until we see that happen and I couldn't predict whether that will happen or not.","Jerry Revich","Okay, thank you.","John McPherson","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research.","James Armstrong","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. First question I have is margins in the fourth quarter were really strong and then you mentioned fuel, but as fuel costs have come down have you seen distances that you can ship aggregates rise and if so what effect are you seeing from that trend?","John McPherson","Theoretically that could happen, but I will also tell you that with rising demand, rising confidence, people are servicing the market and possibly serving the market closer to them as opposed, they don\u2019t have to reach out because the work is improving right around where they are. And this goes back to pricing environment and the health of it and people recognizing that we are not back to normal demand yet they've got to make returns on the investments they have and that\u2019s true for aggregates or asphalt or concrete or contracting. So \u2013 while I understand why you asked the question and it's a very good one, it's not playing out that way.","Tom Hill","Most of our urban markets, which is a concentration for us, you've got a lot of other barriers to long haul shipping or truck \u2013 long trucking that go way beyond diesel costs, it\u2019s availability of drivers, availability of trucks, traffic patterns, regulatory issues around trucking, unpredictable service quality to further your are tucking the stuff. So there are a lot more things, particularly in urban environment to go into this and adjust diesel price right now.","James Armstrong","Okay, that helps. And then switching gears to the Highway bill that you touched on a lot on today's call, you don't see much impact in 2016 yet, but what projects are out there and what type of visibility do you have for 2017 and beyond, can you help us quantify that a little bit?","Tom Hill","I'm not sure I can give you individual projects. There are a number of very large projects that are in the works. There are bidding that are out there. I think what I'm not sure I could identify off the top of my head any specific large projects, but places like Tennessee, for example, have actually held a number of projects because they did not have visibility. Now what those are, I'm not sure I could \u2013 I could quote to you, but that's an example.","I think what you will also see is it will be two things, it will be \u2013 part of it will be expansion and new projects, which we love because they are more intensive, but you've got a lot of states like South Carolina that really are and a number of other states that really have a lot of maintenance issues they will flow through very quickly. It may not be large projects, but with that funding there they will go head and these are overlays and things like that, which will come faster than the large projects.","James Armstrong","That helps. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Elliott","Hi, guys. Thank you for fitting me in. Quick question about the improvements you guys made on the call side of the question. You talked about repair and maintenance costs coming down. Is that because of new equipment that came in, some of the growth CapEx to help bring those numbers down. And then the second part to the question was around labor costs with lower overtime, does that mean that you sufficiently kind of staffed up some of these plants that had been needing or borderline needing a second shift or what have you to the point where now it should be smoother sailing heading into 2016?","Tom Hill","I think you a little bit answered your own question and that obviously replacement capital and mobile equipment, fixed equipment helps to driven down [ph] cost. But it's really \u2013 what we really focus on while we do that and we do that appropriately, what we really focus on is doing proper preventative maintenance and timing and fixing things the right way the first time so you are not throwing good money after bad.","When it comes to whether it's labor or uses of diesel or cost in general, I think it's that continuous focus on operating efficiencies. You heard us talk about we struggle with labor, we define \u2013 our folks defined it. And then actually in the back third of the year, it wasn't just last quarter, September forward they made significant improvements on their efficiency to labor and their planning. And again, so you're correct about shifts where you're bringing things up and you're running multiple crews between even more plans, labor can be a challenge without appropriate planning.","I am very pleased with our operating people that they are never been satisfied, they are campaigning for continuous improvement and they focus and work hard every day and I give them credit. They are never satisfied and they work tirelessly on it. But all of this is about compounding that continuous improvement to give us the margin expansion that we've enjoyed over the last ten quarters. And that speaks to that never being satisfied and that continuous campaign to improve and improve those operating efficiencies.","Stanley Elliott","One last one, the issues kind of going on with the credit market does that have any bearing on when you guys ultimately and finally get bumped up to investment grade?","Tom Hill","You probably have to ask the rating agencies. It should not from my point of view, but that's obviously up to the agencies.","Stanley Elliott","Yeah, fair enough. Thanks guys and congratulations and best of luck.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","John McPherson","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Thanks. Great quarter, great year. John, could you elaborate on your comment about product balances in the public sector to work with. Are you referring to some of the downstream businesses or is that related to the types of aggregate you expect as the market gets more momentum?","John McPherson","It's more of the types of aggregate. New construction can be more aggregate intensive, but It helps us if you will produce and so the full product mix whether that's asphalt size, that\u2019s concrete size base. And so It's very efficient work for us if we do it the right way. And it's just a better mix than we\u2019ve had, I\u2019m going to call it, earlier in the recovery. My main point from that that I would like to make for people as we tend to focus only on the price impact when it's conceivable that it could have a marginally negative price impact yet be very positive for unit margins.","Brent Thielman","Got it. And I know a lot of questions on this Highway bill. I will ask one more. I'm curious to your thoughts states now have greater federal funding clarity, do you see or hear any conversations or anticipate that this bill could actually be a catalyst for more states now to kind of think about a gas or sales tax. I know we have seen a few of them already but given the sense that they have some idea of what's coming to them from the federal government and there are certain needs out there. Could that push more through some of the state?","Tom Hill","Absolutely. And I think you said it best. It is being a catalyst for states that haven't increased their funding to take matters into their own hands. They recognize the opportunity they have with increased and long-term federal funding. So you will see a number of states, California, Santa Clara, for example, who are \u2013 the state legislature are in the throes of trying to address much-needed infrastructure improvements.","Brent Thielman","Okay. And then of all of this with the bill in place in your served markets, where do you think this can have the biggest impact or where do you feel like the burdens been greatest because of lack of federal funding clarity?","Tom Hill","I think we\u2019ve had a number of states that have \u2013 Tennessee to be an example, Arkansas is an example, South Carolina is an example, they've been very hesitant to increase their own funding but also to let much-needed major projects that are multi-year because either they have a legal obligation that they can't or they're worried about being paid back. So I think as you\u2019ve said in your opening question and comment, it will be a catalyst for both.","Brent Thielman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And you next question comes from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.","Mike Betts","Yeah, thank you very much. I have two questions if I could please. First one on --","Tom Hill","Mike, I'm sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.","Mike Betts","Can you hear me any better now?","Tom Hill","That's great. Sorry about that.","Mike Betts","No worries. I had two questions if I could. First one, returning to the non-res area, is it possible to give us some indication of when you kind of did the budget, roughly what proportion of the work assumed in non-res was already contracted and therefore there\u2019s some kind of certainty because I'm sure you follow all of the contract award states rather than you took a view it might happen just to give us some \u2013 maybe some \u2013 a bit more confidence in that non-res numbers? And then secondly on the asphalt because it expanded quite significantly in 2015. How much now is kind of maintenance work, which is let probably during the year that the work is done rather than long-term contracts?","John McPherson","Clarity on the non-res, I'm not sure I can give you a percentage of what is backlog, that\u2019s really hard to do, because so many of those are small jobs that you have to get into the local detail whether it\u2019s a Walmart parking lot or a big box store or a high-rise. That's really hard to predict.","Tom Hill","The heavy side of it is pretty clear.","John McPherson","Yeah. And that\u2019s where I was going. The big work, the major projects we have very good clarity, in fact we are already shipping them or we know exactly when they are going to start because those jobs have very tight and very tough deadlines. Very specific delivery obligations and so we know exactly what's going on with those.","Mike Betts","You were asked earlier, I am not sure that you wanted to answer to it, but the rough split heavy and light.","John McPherson","I'm not sure I have a number for you. I have to get back with you on that.","Mike Betts","Okay, okay. And then on the asphalt again a big, short-term work versus long-term work, rough proportions and what happens like if \u2013 if the actual price moves dramatically?","Tom Hill","I think there is probably a pretty good mix of short-term and long-term work, the majority of it, I would usually when you look at that overlays are shorter term, new construction is longer-term, you're going to be more heavily weighted towards the shorter term for overlays as opposed to new construction. I would tell you that towards the end of this year and moving into 2017 and 2018, you'll see the market piece of that of the longer-term growth and we've seen that grow over the last 18 months. But the majority of it's going to be shorter term.","John McPherson","And Mike while our material margins in asphalt can fluctuate period to period, I'm not sure this is quite what you're asking but we don't have lots and lots of long-term fixed-price contracts or anything like that.","Mike Betts","Okay.","John McPherson","So, obviously, the margin can fluctuate period to period as you know asphalt can be a bit more volatile in its margin than some other parts of the business. Although generally always positive and good. But, no, we don't have lots of long-term fixed-price contracts that give us some big exposure.","Mike Betts","And just to finalize on that, have you \u2013 I mean, the liquid asphalt price I think was \u2013 the cost was declining way slower than the oil price, is that still the situation?","Tom Hill","Liquid asphalt prices have probably somewhat leveled off. And I think that's how we \u2013 as we plan this, that would be our plan now. Who knows, [indiscernible], but as I said earlier with that, we do have a modest increase improvement in our unit margins in asphalt. And that's really driven by some operating efficiencies and some actually some new capital we put into that product line as well as we think we've got a little bit better from an operating perspective.","Mike Betts","Understood. That's great. Thank you both very much.","Operator","And we have no further questions. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for any closing remarks.","Tom Hill","I would tell you thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials. I would like to thank our folks for their tireless efforts to improve our company. I would also like to reiterate we are very excited about our future, we look forward to talking to you in the weeks to come. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line."],"22197":["Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  8, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Donald M.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO. Mr. James, you may begin.","Donald M. James","Good morning. And thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2012. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's third quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.","Turning now to Slide 3. I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. We continued to deliver earnings improvement during the quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA of $146 million, an increase of 9% over the third quarter of last year. We achieved these results despite a demand environment that remains highly challenging, as reflected in the weak volume we saw in the quarter.","Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.14 per diluted share, a 27% (sic) [$0.27] per share improvement from a loss of $0.13 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. The earnings impact of lower Aggregate volumes was about $18 million of EBITDA or $0.10 per diluted share.","We also generated higher Aggregates profitability. Aggregates unit profitability as measured by cash gross profit per ton was a third quarter record and the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Aggregates segment gross profit margin increased 340 basis points due to a 4% increase in Aggregates pricing and the benefits of our continued cost-reductions efforts. Cost reduction is an ongoing focus of our management team and all of our employees. In addition to lower unit cost of sales in our Aggregates business, we also realized our fourth consecutive quarterly decline in year-over-year SAG expenses.","As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the leading indicators for private sector construction. In addition, we're looking forward to more predictable funding provided by the new federal highway bill and the benefits from a greatly expanded TIFIA program within that bill.","Moving now to Slide 4. We are very pleased with the margin expansion we realized in the third quarter and year-to-date, particularly given the lack of top line growth. Our margin expansion will further enhance earnings leverage as volumes recover.","Employees throughout the company remain keenly focused on managing controllable costs. Thanks to their continued efforts, earnings leverage in our Aggregates business continues to grow as evidenced by the consistent increases in gross profit margins and adjusted EBITDA. We also benefited from stronger pricing in both the third quarter and the year-to-date periods.","Through the 9 months ended September 30 of this year, adjusted EBITDA, which excludes $18 million in real estate gains, was $321 million, up $64 million or 25%. Again, this was despite a 1% decline in Aggregate volumes.","SAG expenses for the third quarter were $65 million, down from $67 million for the third quarter last year. Excluding the effects of certain accounting charges tied primarily to employee benefit plans and resulting from the increase in the company's stock price, SAG expenses were reduced $10 million from the prior year's third quarter.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter, Danny?","Danny R. Shepherd","Thanks, Don. Turning to our segment results on Slide 5. As Don said earlier, Aggregate segment revenue remained sluggish as a result of weaker volumes. On a same-store basis, Aggregates declined 6%. But we are pleased in spite of the sluggishness in public construction, Aggregates' gross profit increased $12 million from the prior year's third quarter.","Aggregates' cash gross profit per ton was $4.75, a 10% improvement over the prior year. As Don mentioned, and I would like to further emphasize, the $4.75 per ton Aggregates cash gross profit is a record level of unit profitability for the third quarter. Also, gross profit margins expanded, as he said, by 340 basis points over prior year third quarter.","Pricing, which was good news, and specifically a 4% improvement in pricing contributed significantly to higher segment earnings and profitability. In addition, our operations teams lowered unit cost of sales for the quarter by 1%.","Turning to Slide 6. Here, you'll see our bridge for the Aggregates segment, and it shows the benefit of higher pricing and effective cost control, which more than offset the earnings effect of lower volumes. Now it's important to note that despite overall sluggish volumes in the quarter, we were encouraged by strong Aggregates shipments in several key states, including Arizona, Florida and Texas.","Total volumes from these 3 states increased 12%, due primarily to growing demand from private construction. Now if you look at the green bars on the slide, they illustrate the earnings contribution of higher pricing and lower cost. Year-over-year price improvement was achieved in most of the company's markets, including key markets in Florida, Texas and in the states -- and in Southeast states, the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest.","The improvement in operating cost is a result of our intense focus on cost control and productivity. In the quarter, our unit cost of sales decreased 1% on lower production volumes. And when we look at our operating metrics, like we do, it shows that we continue to improve.","Turning to Slide 7. You'll see from this chart that we remain encouraged by the momentum that we've seen over the last year. Aggregates unit profitability continues to improve. And for the 12 -- for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2012, our cash gross profit per ton was $4.28, and that is 8% higher than the prior year and 30% higher than the peak year in volumes, which was 2005.","If you turn to Slide 8 now. Third quarter earnings from the company's non-Aggregate segments were in line with prior year. Earnings improvement in Cement and Concrete offset a slight decrease in Asphalt mix gross profit.","On Slide 8, you can see evidence that continued recovery in private construction activity led to solid increases in ready-mix Concrete and Cement volume, as well as year-over-year growth in pricing for both segments.","Concrete gross profit for the third quarter improved slightly from the prior year period. Year-to-date, Concrete gross profit was a loss of $30 million, a $2 million improvement over the prior year.","Private construction led by housing is recovering sharply in Florida. There, ready-mix Concrete volumes are up more than 20% and Concrete block, albeit a smaller part of the Concrete segment, are up almost 30% through the first 9 months of 2012.","Cement segment gross profit approximated a breakeven position in the third quarter, a modest improvement from the prior year. Through the first 9 months of 2012, Cement gross profit has improved $4 million from the prior year.","Finally, in our Asphalt segment, gross profit in the third quarter was $11 million, which is a decrease of $1 million from the year ago period. The unit cost for liquid asphalt increased 3%, thus reducing Asphalt segment earnings by $1 million.","Consistent with the public-sector demand, Asphalt sales volumes in California, the company's largest asphalt market, were down versus the prior year, which more than offset volume increases in Texas and Arizona. Year-to-date Asphalt mix segment gross profit was $15 million compared with $20 million in 2011.","In total, gross profit for our non-Aggregates segment has improved 9% over 2011 year-to-date.","Overall, we believe the non-Aggregates earnings performance has stabilized and should benefit from increased private construction activity. We remain focused on maximizing the Aggregates shipments that are pulled through our downstream businesses, and we're focused on improving our profit and cash flow performance of these very valuable assets.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the program back over to Don.","Donald M. James","Thank you, Danny. If you'll turn now to Slide 9, I want to focus for a moment on publicly funded construction, more specifically highway construction.","This slide depicts the historical relationship of the timing of contract awards to the passage of new federal highway bills. You will notice that historically, increases in contract awards for highway projects have followed the passage of new federal highway bills. This trend should continue with the July 2012 passage of the new federal highway bill MAP-21, which will provide stability and predictability to highway funding for the next several years.","Evidence of this relationship between growth in new construction activity and the passage of a new federal highway bill can be seen in dollars obligated for qualified federal projects. In the last 2 months of fiscal year 2012, that is, in August and September of this year, 42% of the full year $38 billion budget was obligated. This share of full year funding was disportionately larger than normal, which means the prior 10 months were disproportionately smaller, and is indicative of the state DOT's positive response to the final passage of a new highway bill in July.","In the third quarter, the passage of the new highway bill had no material impact on shipments, which reflected softness in highway construction from the weak contract awards during the past 20 months as reflected on Slide 9, and the winding down of stimulus-related construction.","Moving now to Slide 10. This map highlights one of the important features contained in the new federal highway bill. The large increase in Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act or TIFIA funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact demand in the future, particularly for several key Vulcan-served states. The current backlog of potential projects requesting TIFIA funding is substantial. Currently, letters of interest for 54 transportation projects have been submitted for more than $65 billion in total project cost. More than $42 billion of the projects are in Vulcan-served counties, with almost 80% in Vulcan-served counties in 3 states: California, Texas and Virginia. The uncertain timing of shipments to larger projects, including these TIFIA- funded projects, continues to make forecasting quarterly volume growth difficult.","Turning now to Slide 11. Looking at the other portion of public construction activity, you can see that other public infrastructure contract awards are improving. On this slide, we have overlaid year-over-year change in contract awards for new construction, with construction activity completed as measured by the Census Bureau's construction put in place monthly survey.","As you can see, there is a lag effect between the leading indicator, that is contract award, and the actual construction. We are optimistic that the growth in recent awards will continue and actual construction growth will follow.","We'll move now to Slide 12. As we mentioned before, private construction activity, specifically, residential housing starts and contract awards for nonresidential buildings, continued to improve during the quarter, offsetting some residual softness in highway construction resulting from the prolonged delay in the renewal of the federal highway bill.","On Slide 12, we see a very nice fit between housing starts and the actual construction activity, with a predictable lag between the start and completion of construction. We believe this growth trend will continue.","The same can be said for private nonresidential construction shown on Slide 13. Here, you see a slightly longer lag than in residential, but again, evidence of growth in new contract awards followed by growth in actual construction activity. Consequently, Aggregates demand in the private construction is beginning to grow. We are seeing evidence of this [indiscernible] in several of our key states, including Florida, Texas and Arizona.","We are in the midst of our planning for 2013. But preliminarily, we believe the indicators shown on the last 5 slides point toward solid growth in Aggregates demand in 2013. We expect private construction demand to grow again in 2013 as housing starts and contract awards for private nonresidential buildings continue to improve. Additionally, we expect the stability and predictability that will come from the new federal highway bill, coupled with the potential for large TIFIA-related transportation projects to begin in several of our key states some times next year, could lead to modest growth in demand for highway construction. We will provide you with additional details in February when we report our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2013.","Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2012 on Slide 14. We now expect same-store shipments in 2012 to approximate the 2011 level, and total Aggregate shipments to decline approximately 1%. As a result of our successful efforts to offset the earnings effect of lower volume, we will continue to reduce controllable cost and achieve improved pricing. The geographic breadth of pricing gains achieved in the third quarter reinforces our expectations for full year freight adjusted price growth of 1% to 3% in 2012. This price growth reflects the continued recovery in private construction activity and the newly enacted federal highway legislation. We remain laser focused on improving our profitability at today's volume, while enhancing our already strong operating leverage.","Full year earnings improvements in the company's Cement and Concrete segments are expected to offset lower Asphalt mix segment earnings. As a result, collectively, full year non-Aggregates earnings are expected to approximate last year. Cost-reduction initiatives continue to improve Vulcan's run rate profitability. These initiatives are reducing our overhead cost and support our expectations for full year SAG cost to be approximately $260 million compared to $290 million in 2011.","We continue to focus on executing our initiatives, enabling us to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, further improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead cost and strengthen our credit profile.","We now expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $435 million to $455 million, an improvement of 23% to 29% from the prior year and a significant accomplishment in the current economic environment. This adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects principally the earnings effect of lower volumes in Aggregates and Asphalt, and the timing of realization of our cost-reduction initiatives. Approximately $20 million of the decrease from our prior guidance is a result of the earnings effect of lower Aggregates volume, and approximately $20 million is from lower earnings in Asphalt and Concrete. The remaining $15 million relates to delay in the realization of some cost savings component of our Profit Enhancement Plan. We expect to exceed our $25 million target for our Profit Enhancement Plan in 2012, and we remain on track to achieve the target run rate savings in 2013.","Our efforts to accelerate more of the 2013 savings into 2012 have proven more challenging than we thought earlier in the year, in part because of weaker volumes. This EBITDA guidance excludes results related to the Planned Asset Sales and cost associated with the unsolicited offer terminated earlier this year. This guidance does include $29 million in gains, of which $18 million has been realized through the first 9 months of 2012. These gains are incremental to the $4 million of routine gains completed during the normal course of business.","The company continues to work on additional asset sales in the fourth quarter that are expected to result in $100 million to $150 million of cash proceeds, and incremental gains of $25 million to $45 million. However, the ultimate timing of these transactions is difficult to predict, and thus, we have excluded them from our current guidance.","In terms of cash as of September 30, cash and cash equivalents total $243 million. Debt maturities in the fourth quarter of 2012 total $135 million, which we expect to pay off out of available cash. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $100 million for 2012.","In summary, turning now to Slide 15, we are pleased to see continued earnings improvement. This quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of higher year-over-year profitability. Overall, year-to-date controllable costs have decreased approximately $70 million. Through the first 9 months of 2012, adjusted EBITDA is up sharply from the prior year and earnings per diluted share has improved.","Finally, we remain cautiously optimistic that construction-related fundamentals will continue to improve. Trailing 12-month contract awards for private construction continue to grow. And if history repeats itself, contract awards for highways should again begin to recover with the new federal highway bill in place.","Demand for our products is driven by economic cycles and public infrastructure funding, which are largely beyond our control. We do have control over our cost and pricing initiatives that will enable us to generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, further improving our operating leverage, reducing our overhead cost and strengthening our credit profile.","With that, I'll now turn the phone over to the operator to begin your questions. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan, and we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have Bob Wetenhall from RBC on line with a question.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was just hoping to get a little bit of clarification on the guidance. It sounds like your new range of $435 million to $455 million, that is down from $500 million which was the prior guidance, but it's up year-over-year from the $354 million number last year. Is that correct?","Donald M. James","That is correct.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Could you fill us in, in terms of asset sales between normally occurring and nonrecurring? What's included in that number and what's excluded?","Donald M. James","Bob, there was $29 million of gains that were in our $500 million guidance, which remain in our current guidance. Any other asset sales under our planned asset program are not included in our current guidance and were not included in our prior guidance, and that's the -- those are the items we talked about that could generate $100 million to $150 million of cash. Year-to-date, of the $29 million in our guidance in gains, we have already realized $18 million, and we expect to realize the remaining $11 million in the fourth quarter.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood. That's helpful. Could you touch on -- your sales in the Aggregates business were unfavorably impacted by volume, sales were off $24 million, but I saw that gross profit rose by $12 million. Can you just talk about the sustainability of incremental margins at that level? And kind of what's driving that? Because I assume it's pretty difficult to get better gross margins off much weaker volume, and I'm just trying to understand how that's working.","Donald M. James","Well, it is a combination of a lot of factors. As Danny Shepherd pointed out, our unit cost for Aggregates was down 1% in the quarter through a lot of work at the plants. Our pricing was up 4% and those are powerful numbers. We are, I think, extraordinarily well-positioned to benefit from a little bit of volume recovery. And we are, as a management team, and I think our entire employee group, is really encouraged by the fact that we are generating record levels of unit profitability at lower volume, both lower sales volumes and lower production volumes. And when volume comes back, we get a compounding effect from higher production volumes and the opportunities that come with slightly higher volumes in our market. So we're really encouraged where we are, both from the standpoint of the things that we can control, which is price and cost. And equally important, as we look at the future given the contract awards in the private sector, both housing and non-res, as well as the real opportunities from the new highway bill, in particular, the big TIFIA projects that are about to kick off in 2013, we're very encouraged by our opportunities for next year.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And if I could just sneak a last question in. Could you touch on how you think...","[Audio Gap]","in the Concrete business?","Donald M. James","Yes. As I think as Danny Shepherd pointed out, year-to-date, housing starts in Florida, for example, are up 38%. Our ready-mix shipments in Florida year-to-date are up 21%, in the last quarter, they were up 33%. So housing starts are a huge driver for Concrete demand, and obviously, every -- virtually every yard of concrete we pour has got Vulcan Aggregates in it and then Florida has Vulcan Cement in it, so that really has a significant effect not only on the Concrete business, but also the Aggregates and Cement business.","Operator","Trey Grooms from Stephens Incorporated is on line with a question.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Given your kind of high-level outlook, I guess, for 2013, it sounds like you're expecting improvement, I guess, pretty much across the board but especially in highways. Given that, should we be expecting any type of geographic or product mix impact on pricing as we kind of look on to the next year or so?","Donald M. James","Trey, it's too early for us to try to give you guidance on that. I think we expect private sector construction to grow on a percentage basis, probably significantly more in 2013 than public-sector construction. Although, we do think there is an opportunity for growth in the public sector, and the big wildcard is how quickly some of these big TIFIA projects kick off. The Interstate 95 HOT Lane project, which is a $927 million project up in Northern Virginia, is scheduled to begin in '13. The Grand Parkway in Houston, which is a $1.1 billion project, is scheduled to begin in '13. And I think the Route 460 in the Hampton Roads to Richmond TIFIA project, which is over $1.7 billion. And there is a big project in Dallas-Fort Worth, about $1.6 billion, the Southwest Parkway\/Chisholm Trail. Those are 4 big TIFIA projects that are -- have the potential to start in 2013. And if they do, that could certainly impact or would significantly impact demand. But it's just really too early for us to know whether and how much of those big projects will likely to occur in '13, but the basic highway program is in place. And as I pointed out, 42% of the money for 2012 in the regular highway program was not obligated until -- by the states, until after the MAP-21 passed in July. So the effect of that is that, that made the current year weak and is pushing a disproportional amount of the 2012 highway budget into 2013. We'll have better data on all of that when we talk to you again in February. But directionally, I think we are encouraged that all end markets are likely to be up or all of our major end markets are likely to be up in 2013 over 2012.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. I guess, I may have missed this in your prepared comments, but what were California volumes in the quarter?","Donald M. James","California volumes in the quarter were down slightly. Let me check that.","Daniel F. Sansone","Down about 6% or 7%.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","6% to 7%?","Daniel F. Sansone","Yes.","Donald M. James","Yes.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then lastly, is there any update you can give us on the progress of any potential asset sales or anything like that from some of the stuff you outlined a few quarters ago?","Donald M. James","No. We're still working hard. We have pretty strict criteria about what we would sell and under what circumstances. But as I pointed out, it is about $100 million to $150 million of transactions that are in the process of being, I'll say, papered I guess. So we're working on those. Whether some or all of those hit in the fourth quarter or close in the fourth quarter is not certain at this point, but they are all in the process.","Operator","Garik Shmois from Longbow Research is on line with a question.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Don, you have outlined a number of large TIFIA projects in your markets. I was wondering if you could help us maybe understand a little bit the lag between when these projects would start and when you would actually start to see Aggregates shipments into these projects, just so as we start following these projects a little bit more closely, we might be able to time your volumes associated with them?","Donald M. James","Well, I wish we could project them better ourselves. We have gotten a lot of information from the TIFIA office that -- the metrics I gave you earlier all come from the TIFIA office. The particular projects that I mentioned are already approved by the Federal DOT and are likely to begin or certainly have a probability or possibility of beginning sometime in 2013. And that is the I-95 HOT Lanes in Northern Virginia, Grand Parkway in Houston, the Southwest Parkway\/Chisholm Trail in Dallas-Fort Worth and the Route 460 from Hampton Roads to Richmond. Those are, I guess, in total probably $6 billion in TIFIA work. But the bigger chunk are in the letters that have been submitted to the TIFIA office and the Federal DOT for approval. And as I pointed out, the big majority of those are in Virginia, California and Texas. And as those projects get approved and as the contracting authority then starts awarding projects, we will have a lot better sense of what that would mean for the magnitude and the timing of increased shipments. But I think the real point about TIFIA is, while the regular federal highway bill is at $40 billion plus or minus a year, according to the DOT, in the next 2-year period, there could be another $40 billion over that 2-year period of incremental awards under the TIFIA program. So when we say we have optimism about growth in awards, it's based on, number one, the stability in the regular Federal Highway Program now that we have one, plus the big increase in TIFIA. The wildcard at this point is the timing of those shipments and the quantity of those shipments, and we'll continue to update you on that as we have better information.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","And I guess just switching to margins. Certainly, another good quarter of cost control. Just wondering how much of your $100 million profit enhancement program has been realized year-to-date, and perhaps if you could provide some granularity as how much was incremental in the third quarter?","Donald M. James","Well, as I've said in my prepared remarks, our target for 2012 was $25 million. We will get more than that. I don't have an amount that we would call out in the third quarter. But some of the metrics that would -- that you can look at is our SAG, we expect to be down $30 million in the year. Some of that is under our Profit Enhancement Plan. Some of it is from the work we had done earlier in our restructuring. Our controllable costs are down $70 million year-to-date, a significant portion of that is coming from Profit Enhancement Plan. The reason things are murky, Garik, is that we have a lot of cost initiatives going on throughout the organization. Some of it is an outline of the Profit Enhancement Plan, which we gave you earlier, which is all still in place, but there's a lot of additional stuff going on. And whether we count it as a Profit Enhancement Plan or other cost reduction is largely irrelevant to us. We just like the cost reduction. And so I think the combination of the 2 so far is about a $70 million year-to-date reduction in our controllable cost.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just my last question is on Asphalt demand. If I remember correctly coming out of the second quarter, you had anticipated year-over-year growth in Asphalt earnings, you anticipated some large project starts in the second half of the year supporting that, and now it doesn't sound like those projects are going to be starting in the back half of the year. Just wondering if you could speak to that, if I remember that correctly, maybe provide an update on to when you would anticipate some of these big projects would get under way.","Donald M. James","Let me refer that to Danny Shepherd.","Danny R. Shepherd","Yes, Garik. First of all, as I pointed out, we had a good quarter in Texas and Arizona. We are challenged in California, and more specifically, Southern California, and we're moving to address that market properly. In Southern California, there was some work that was not let that was anticipated. And as you know, we are an asphalt producer\/supplier, and we have customer alignments in Southern California, and some of our customers missed work in the quarter. So we are really focused on Southern California because we found that, that's our weakest asphalt market, and hopefully, we will see improvement as we travel through 2013.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I guess just real quickly to follow up, would you anticipate some of these projects that weren't let would be let in 2013 or are these projects...","Danny R. Shepherd","Yes, we do. Sorry, I didn't answer that part of your question.","Operator","Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research is on line with a question.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","For the quarter, could you give some clarity of how much did pricing benefit from mix versus natural price increases, and maybe talk -- you touched on a little bit earlier, but maybe digging a little bit more into that dynamic with mix, particularly if we get into larger infrastructure projects that would be more base rock heavy.","Donald M. James","Yes. Kathryn, of our 4% price growth, about 3 percentage points of the 4% are real price growth spread over the vast majority of our markets. That's very encouraging. About 1% could be accounted for as mix shift, more of that in geographic mix, a little bit in product mix, with some asphalt, high price, high specification asphalt material. But our shipments in the Midwest were relatively lower than in the Sun Belt, and we have relatively better pricing in the Sun Belt than we do in the Midwest. And so about 3% is just across the board price improvement, about 1% is a positive mix shift. And you asked about will -- the TIFIA projects, in some cases, like in Northern Virginia with the HOT Lanes or lane additions, those are beautiful for us in the sense that the aggregate intensity per dollar of spending is about as good as it gets because, as you point out, there's base then there's the lift of either concrete or asphalt to get to the surface, the surface mixes. So they're -- but the TIFIA projects and the Grand Parkway in Houston is, I think, virtually all new construction, and that would consume base, the highway 460 in Virginia is virtually all new construction, and that would consume a full range of Aggregate products. So I think, whether that will change our pricing mix is way too early for us to tell. But you're correct that this new construction will consume base, as well as clean stone, which certainly will help with our production and production cost.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Yes. So even if pricing was slightly lower, the volume would trump that anyway?","Donald M. James","Oh, absolutely.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Could you talk a little bit more detail about the new resi construction activity that you see. You've talked a little bit about Florida, but also in Texas and Arizona. What scale projects are you seeing implemented? Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about new construction in all of those markets, but if you could give a sense of what types of projects and how they compared relative to the peak of the market and what you think, what is a normal market?","Donald M. James","Well, we are -- I'll go to the first, and I'll give some examples. Housing starts year-to-date are up 66% in Arizona. They're up 23% in California. They're up 38% in Florida. They're up 36% in North Carolina, 29% in Tennessee, 28% in Texas. In Vulcan-served counties overall, they're up 26%. That being said, they're coming from a relatively low base. So the good news is, they're up. We look at housing numbers like everyone else. I guess right now, we're in the 850,000 range, annual seasonally adjusted range. Most people are saying that will be 900,000 to maybe over 1 million. And we believe, based on what we see and hear from economists and housing experts is that the normalized run rate should be something like 1.5 million, 1.4 million to 1.5 million. And given the pent-up demand and the number of household formations, I believe there's an article in Wall Street Journal yesterday about that. We've been 5 years with collapsed housing starts, and at some point, the demographics in the U.S. are going to drive that sharply upward. And I think we're beginning to see the front end of that change. That helps our Aggregates business, but it really helps our Concrete business in Florida, California, and Texas and Northern Virginia. And I didn't mention Virginia, but Virginia, Northern Virginia, in particular, housing came back much earlier than in the rest of these states. So it's been improving now for 18 months or so.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Okay, great. Any plans on paying off the $140 million note due in 2013, what are your plans?","Donald M. James","We're going to pay it off out of available cash. We're not refinancing either the bonds that come due end of this year or the ones in June of next year.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Any ballpark...","Donald M. James","We'll have sufficient cash flow to do that. Dan, do you have a comment?","Daniel F. Sansone","Yes. We have over $200 million on the balance sheet at the end of September. At the end of this year, we estimate that our cash will be in the neighborhood of $100 million, and that's after paying off the December maturities. So we expect to pay the June maturity next year off out of available cash and free cash flow and not term that out, just have a net reduction in debt.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","And just to clarify, what will be the interest expense savings from this?","Daniel F. Sansone","That will be approximately $14 million in total interest expense should be the reduction in interest from 2012 to 2013. Of that $14 million reduction in interest expense, $12 million will be cash, $2 million is noncash.","Operator","We have Jack Kasprzak from BB&T Capital Markets on line with a question.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","With regard to the cost reduction, profit improvement program, what can you say about, or update us rather on what we can expect in 2013? I don't think you've changed the overall goal of the program. What's left or what will be realized in 2013? And I would expect SG&A could be down again in absolute dollars, is that -- would that be a reasonable assumption?","Donald M. James","Yes. And our target, as you know, is $100 million, and have in place by mid-year '13, $75 million, and by the end of '13, I think the full $100 million on a run rate, on a run-rate basis. There's a substantial procurement piece of that, and the procurement dollars savings are tied to production volume. And so if we are getting cost savings on various items in procurement, that is affected significantly by volume. So as volumes recover, we can expect that the procurement piece of the Profit Enhancement Plan to materialize in relation to volume recovery, at least in part. Not all of the procurement savings are tied to plant production, but a significant portion are. The overhead piece is largely in place, and we'll continue to get the benefit of that, and the transportation and logistics piece is being rolled out. So we're, I think, optimistic that we will achieve our targets as we have laid them out earlier this year.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. Maybe this is a question for Dan. What would, could you just update us on what you think maybe a normalized tax rate is, for modeling purposes? Obviously, in recent quarters, it's been a bit all over the map.","Daniel F. Sansone","Yes. And unfortunately, the quarterly numbers will continue to fluctuate. Here is the way I would try to model it going forward, Jack. Build your model, get down to a pretax earnings number, earnings or loss, begin with about a 38% to 39% tax or credit, and then about $20 million of tax benefit referable to statutory depletion. So the net of those 2 numbers, marginal tax at 39% less roughly a $20 million statutory depletion benefit is going to get you pretty darn close.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Depletion's rated on volume?","Daniel F. Sansone","Pardon me?","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","The amount of depletion by quarter is a function of volume?","Daniel F. Sansone","Well, the amount of depletion annually is a function of volume. It's actually a function of revenues, but it's driven by volume. The quarterly recognition of that is a function of a set of fairly complex tax accounting rules, sometimes it's pro rata, sometimes it's not, depending on whether you're in an income or loss position. So I would -- it's tougher to give you guidance on how to build the quarterly number. I would just start with the annual number and keep tracking towards that.","Operator","Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo is on line with a question.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about your CapEx guidance for 2012, I think you said $100 million, and you only spent about $50 million year-to-date, so what's driving the big uptick in the fourth quarter?","Donald M. James","Adam, we, as we've said before, our CapEx requirements are really a function of volume, of materials. So we are still looking at that, but we do have -- we've got about an $18 million acquisition of reserves at an existing quarry that will close in the fourth quarter, and that will push our CapEx number up. But that will add a lot of reserves to a very good quarry, and that will bring us back closer to the $100 million that we're projecting.","Daniel F. Sansone","And the remaining difference, to get up towards the $100 million is really just a series of relatively small projects, a piece of mobile equipment there or here, or a small piece there, it's just -- there's no single project that jumps out, Adam.","Operator","Keith Hughes from SunTrust is on line with a question.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You had referred in the prepared comments I believe to $15 million of cost savings that was going to be deferred into 2013, what would that bring the total cost savings look right now in 2013? Number one. And what kind of projects do you have left to do next year?","Donald M. James","I'm having a really hard time hearing your question. I'm sorry, could you repeat it?","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, let me try again.","Donald M. James","Okay, that's much better.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You had referred to $15 million of cost saves that have been pushed into 2013. What -- if that's realized, what would that bring the cost save look in 2013 to in aggregate, I guess number one. And number 2, what kind of projects and what kind of things are you going to be doing next year to realize those numbers?","Donald M. James","Okay. I think we have to start back to what our targets have been. Coming into this year, we were projecting $55 million in savings from a combination of restructuring and other overhead reductions that we had put in place in 2011 and the first part of 2012. Incremental to that was our Profit Enhancement Plan which was $100 million. So a total of $155 million. And we want to have -- our target is to have all of that in place on a run-rate basis by the end of 2013. Now you're trying to put a number in your model, I guess, for 2013.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's correct.","Donald M. James","Through the third quarter, our controllable cost, which is a combination of all of these things, are down about $70 million. So the remainder of that $155 million, we will have in place on a run-rate basis by the end of '13. How much of that will be actually realized and taken to the bottom line in 2013, we'll give you better guidance on that in February after we've gone through our -- completed our planning and budgeting process.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","But the $70 million you referred to is not bottom line, that a run rate number?","Donald M. James","That's bottom line.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's bottom line?","Donald M. James","That's bottom line.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So but the project, whatever it falls to in the near term in terms of cash or the bottom line, the project will be done at the end of 2013, is that still the plan?","Donald M. James","Yes. And I would say this as a caveat. The officially announced Profit Enhancement Plan will be completed on a run-rate basis by '13. It is remarkable to me the opportunities our guys in the plants and in the regions are finding, and I think we will continue to find opportunities for cost savings above and beyond those targets, particularly when we start seeing some volume recovery, which can pull, for example, more of the enhanced procurement savings through the bottom line with additional volume. So we're focused on the $155 million, but I think there are additional opportunities if what we see as volume growth in 2013 materializes.","Operator","Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee is on line with a question.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Don, you have talked about the growth that you're seeing in nonresidential private construction, can you sort of unpeel that a little bit and talk about where and which of the subtypes of non-res you're seeing activity in versus which ones maybe not so much?","Donald M. James","Yes. And I guess I'll refer you back to Slide 11 and Slide 13. Slide 11 is other public infrastructure. That's water, sewer, airports. And you see a bump up in contract awards from the stimulus, then once the stimulus contract awards were done, huge drop, and now you see beginning in sort of April of this year, contract awards turning positive again, on a trailing 12-month basis. So we're seeing that trend. And then if you flip back over to Slide 13, and I don't know whether you're able to do that or not online. But in terms of private non-res buildings, you see a very distinct pattern, where beginning about in first or second quarter of 2011, we started seeing contract awards improving, turning positive on a trailing 12-month basis, and that has continued through the most recent months. Now there is -- and you can also see from that slide, there's probably a 12-month lag between contract awards and actual construction, but there's a very clear pattern. So Todd, I think it's in the private non-res buildings category, and then the publicly funded infrastructure categories where we're seeing contract awards that are positive now for 10 or 12 or 15 months in a row on a trailing 12-month basis, and they will begin to pull material through as those projects get under construction.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it, perfect. And with regard to price, I think you said in the release that prices were up in most every market, is there any place that, that is -- that, that's more difficult or where you're not seeing price go through?","Donald M. James","Within a relatively narrow range, pricing has been stable to improving. The markets where our pricing was not up in the quarter, it's only down like 1% or so. So it's -- pricing is stable, and we're getting good opportunity, as I said, they're up in almost every market, a couple of markets where they're down, they're only down 1%.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And on those markets where they're down 1%, just to be clear, is that a same product, same store shift or is there a mix impact on that? I guess I'm just wondering if real price is dropping anywhere still.","Donald M. James","I would not suggest that real price is dropping anywhere. There are anecdotal spots, but a lot of that's mix shift. I think more than any quarter so far this year, we've got real price improvement showing up across the board.","Operator","Mike Betts from Jefferies is on line with a question.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions related to the downstream business, and I guess, maybe I'll ask the first one because the second one depends on the answer to the first one. You talked already, Don, that the ready-mix and I guess the Asphalt has a lot of your own Aggregates in. In the way you report gross profit, does the profit on those Aggregates appear in the Aggregates division or does it appear in the Asphalt and ready-mix divisions depending on where they are, that's my first question.","Donald M. James","It appears in the Aggregates segment. We attempt to price the Aggregates that are consumed in our Asphalt and Concrete business at market prices for the market in which the Concrete and Asphalt businesses operate, and the profit on the Aggregate is in the Aggregate segment. And with respect to Cement, we try to do the same thing. We try to price the cement to our ready-mix plants at market for Cement and the margin on the Cement is reported in the Cement segment. We also are very sensitive to the lack of profitability in our ready-mix business and are working hard to improve that. But reality is, we also have to look at that on what that business, every yard of concrete that goes out, how much margin is embedded in that, in our Aggregates segment and our Cement segment.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's what I thought was the case. And I guess the follow-up question then is, I'm surprised that the disparity between Asphalt and ready-mix, not so much in where the ready-mix is, but where the Asphalt is, because presumably really most basically, the majority of that is heating the raw materials and adding the bitumen, yet you're still making pretty good margin on that. Or am I missing something there?  Because, I mean, it's a huge disparity between those 2.","Donald M. James","The Asphalt business is a good business if -- the variability in earnings is largely a function of the cost of liquid asphalt versus the time we can get that higher cost built into our pricing. And we get higher Asphalt margins typically in periods in which liquid asphalt is ebbing down, and then the reverse is true when liquid asphalt prices are moving up. I think in this quarter, liquid asphalt prices were up about 2.5% or 2.6%, something in that range, which squeezed our margins a little bit. The real issue in Asphalt though is volume. And with, hopefully, improving demand in highway construction, both regular highway construction and TIFIA construction, in the states where we have asphalt, which are California and Texas primarily, but also in Arizona, that we'll benefit from higher highway construction.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That leads nicely to my final question, Don. Just in relation to those 2 businesses, to help with modeling, because I always seem to be wrong on them. Roughly what proportion of the costs in the Asphalt business and what proportion of the costs in the ready-mix business are fixed costs when we're trying to model the impact of additional volume will be? How much is fixed and how much is variable on the cost side?","Donald M. James","I'm going to refer that question to Mr. Sansone who is working vigorously to calculate.","Daniel F. Sansone","Mike, on the Asphalt business -- I'm sorry, on the ready-mix business first, I would say that the traditional fixed costs would represent something in the neighborhood of 10% of average selling price for the product. It's not a fixed cost intensive business. It might be a few percentage points higher than that, but not a lot. It's basically depreciation and some supervisory cost. In the case of the Asphalt business, a fairly similar although even less fixed cost in that business, probably in the neighborhood of between 5% and 10% of average selling price. So again, they are not -- they're going to really -- what's going to drive earnings in both of those business is what we refer to as material margin, which is the difference between the average selling price and the cost of the raw materials, meaning aggregates and liquid asphalt and\/or cement. [indiscernible] fixed costs in those businesses.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the point about higher volumes means you've got a better chance of increasing that materials margin, I guess, that's the key point.","Daniel F. Sansone","That's right. Absolutely.","Operator","Stuart Benway from S&P Capital IQ is on line with a question.","Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research","Could you just give us a breakdown of how much of your business volume, I guess, really is in residential versus nonresidential versus industrial versus municipal?","Donald M. James","Our projection for this year is that highways would account for 30% or 31% of our aggregate volume. Infrastructure would be about 18% or 19%. Residential, about 17% or 18%. Non-res, about 29%. And nonconstruction, which would be environmental and agricultural, would be about 4%. And the residential historically has been 20% to 25%. And those are not materially different numbers than 2011. So in this current demand environment, that's about the breakout. That will shift as housing and private non-res begin to recover, particularly housing.","Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research","And how about energy, is that in the nonconstruction or non-res?","Donald M. James","Energy is in probably infrastructure.","Daniel F. Sansone","Yes. So if you were building a power plant, it would be in the infrastructure, other infrastructure category that we highlighted in the slides.","Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research","Okay. Then just -- I mean, the volume was down in the third quarter, and you say it was because of weakness in public construction activity, so is that pretty much from the winding down of the stimulus program, do you think?","Donald M. James","Well, it's from 2 reasons. One is, the winding down of stimulus projects, and there are still some stimulus projects, we're still shipping to some stimulus projects. But by and large, the volume going to those projects is tailing off. The other impact is that until July of this year, we did not have a federal highway bill. And even though there was roughly $40 billion in the pipeline for fiscal year 2012, which ended September 30, the states were very cautious about spending money on highway projects and awarding new contracts. So I said in my remarks that 42% of the 2012 federal highway money was not even obligated until the last 2 months of the year, which were August and September, which means that only 58% of the 2012 highway budget was even obligated. Obligation is a step before contract award. And if you look on the slide we had on contract award, you see a very prolonged period of declining trailing 12-month highway contract award certainly beginning to -- the rate of decline beginning to reduce, but it's not yet turned positive. The last positive trailing 12-month period was probably February of 2011. So we've now been, whatever that is, 18 months or so with declining contract awards. And I think the point is, given the passage of the highway bill in July, given the obligation of 42% of the 2012 highway budget in the last 2 months of -- that is in August and September, and given the fact that we have a new highway bill and a big TIFIA potential, we think we'll see recovery in highways. But it's been -- the highway sector, and to some extent, the public infrastructure sector that has been weaker in the current period than we think either the past or the future will indicate. Now there's one other little piece in nonconstruction, and that is the environmental stone to coal burning power plants. That's a small but important piece of our business, but that's way down because utilities are burning more gas and less coal generally, and so consumption of chemical stone for power plants is down sharply, but that's a really small part of our business.","Stuart J. Benway - S&P Equity Research","Just one last quick one. Have you made any -- can you give us any guidance for CapEx for 2013 or is that a volume projection as well?","Donald M. James","We'll give you that in February. At this point, we're still developing our 2013 CapEx budgets.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr.  James for closing remarks.","Donald M.

My name is Jake, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","Now I will like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark Warren","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, you can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","James Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials. Our third quarter results reflected another strong performance, with adjusted EBITDA improving 15% as compared to last year. This was driven primarily by the Aggregates segment, which experienced higher shipments, better pricing and improved unit margins. For the quarter, aggregate shipments increased by 8%, both on a reported and same-store basis. But remember, the quarter did include an extra day. If we normalize the number of shipping days, same-store volume increased by 6%, in line with expectations.","This growth in volume reflects the solid underlying demand fundamentals in our markets. The fundamentals, which include growth in population and households and in jobs, are 2 to 3x the growth of other markets over the next 10 years. Shipments in certain markets in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Texas were particularly strong. Shipments in California were also better than last year due to the strength in Southern and Central California. Freight-adjusted sales prices rose by 5.6%, and importantly, the increases were widespread. On a mix-adjusted basis, prices improved by 5%. Both product mix and geographic mix were slightly favorable. Gross profit per ton grew by 9% in the quarter to $5.87.","We are pleased with the progression of our unit profitability. In fact, this quarter represented the fifth straight quarter of high single-digit or low double-digit year-over-year improvement. The four strategic initiatives reviewed at our recent Investor Day contributed to this outcome and offer further opportunities for margin enhancement.","On a trailing 12-month basis, the aggregate same-store incremental flow-through rate was 60%, which is in line with our long-term guidance. Through the first nine months of the year, aggregate shipments have exceeded the upper end of our expectations. Pricing has increased in line with our expectations, and we had delivered good incremental earnings. This improved Aggregates performance will partially be offset by lower non-Aggregates gross profit. Our non-Aggregates gross profit is now expected to be below original expectations, but in line with the prior year. That said, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth and should carry good momentum into 2020 in all product lines. We expect full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA of between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, on track with our expectations at the beginning of the year.","Looking ahead to next year, we expect another year of strong earnings growth. Based on early successes of our four strategic initiatives, we are confident that our margin expansion will continue. With respect to 2020 aggregate shipments, we anticipate low- to mid-single-digit growth at this time. Vulcan-served markets should continue to benefit from public construction demand led by highways. State and local level transportation funding has increased significantly in our key states, and it will be a multiyear contributor to our future results. Most of the approved funding is firewalled and can be only used for transportation. Therefore, it's not a matter of if, but when. The demand visibility is there but the timing of shipments is not precise, given the number of state and local transportation agencies involved and the relative complexity of large projects.","On the private side, which accounts for the other half of our aggregate shipments. We continue to have solid shipment momentum in most of our markets. It is important to remember that over the medium to long term, the underlying demand fundamentals, including population employment growth, remain firmly in place and underpin long-term growth in residential and nonresidential construction. And we are in the best position with our geographic footprint to capitalize on this trend.","Now turning to price. We expect a positive environment again next year. The visibility of public demand should help drive sales price increases similar to 2019 mid-single-digit range. Together with disciplined capital allocation priorities, the compounding effect of price and unit margin improvement will position us to grow our discretionary cash flows and improve our return profiles in 2020. We will report out our final 2020 guidance in February. Now I'll turn the call over to Suzanne for some additional comments on the results. Suzanne?","Suzanne Wood","Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. Clearly, the third quarter represented another quarter of strong earnings growth for our Aggregates business, but we also made progress in our non-Aggregates segments. Asphalt segment gross profit was $28 million, an increase of $4 million or 16% as compared to the prior year. Asphalt mix shipments increased by 18% and average selling prices rose by 3%. The significant volume increase related to a number of projects across our footprint. The average unit cost for liquid asphalt was 6% higher this quarter compared to the same period last year. This compares favorably to the second quarter when our liquid asphalt costs were 16% higher year-over-year. We expect liquid costs to remain stable throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, asphalt material unit margins were slightly lower than the prior year, and therefore, the gross profit improvement was driven by volume.","Concrete segment gross profit was $15 million or 3% higher than the prior year quarter. Both volume and average selling prices improved. As Tom said, for the full year, we now expect our gross profit from the non-Aggregates segment to be in line with the 2018 level. This change in our outlook is due mostly to the timing of shipments in our Asphalt business.","With respect to SAG costs, our trailing 12-month expense, as a percentage of revenue, declined by 40 basis points. Similar to last quarter, we incurred higher compensation-related expense, including incentives that are tied to earnings expectations and the share price. We also continue to make investments to accelerate the benefits derived from our sales and operational initiatives. For the full year, we remain on track with our expectations and will focus on further leveraging these costs in 2020.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our leverage position and debt structure provide us with significant flexibility as we continue to execute our business plan. Our leverage ratio at September 30 was 2.2x, well within our target range. The weighted average maturity of our debt is 14 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 4.4%.","On Page 8 of the supplemental slides, you'll find information on our discretionary cash flow expectation of $825 million for the full year. As a reminder, we define discretionary cash flow as mid-range adjusted EBITDA guidance, less working capital change, interest, taxes and operating and maintenance capital.","During the quarter, we closed no acquisitions, but we did invest to $3 million in share repurchases. For the full year, we reiterate our expectation of spending approximately $250 million on operating and maintenance CapEx and approximately $200 million on internal growth projects, which will further strengthen the footprint and generate future earnings.","Our return on investment continued on its positive trajectory. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, our ROI was 13.8% on an adjusted-EBITDA basis. This compares to 12.6% for the 2018 fiscal year.","Now before I hand over to Tom, I'll make one comment on our guidance. With a quarter to go, we remain on track with our full year expectations, the midpoint of which has remained unchanged at $1.29 billion. When we gave our initial 2019 annual guidance, we tried to be thoughtful about it. That approach served us well because we have consistently performed within those parameters and, therefore, expect to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.","James Hill","Thanks, Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of Vulcan, for their hard work and dedication. They have taken good care of our customers and have improved our business processes and disciplines. Importantly, they have promoted our strong safety culture and are responsible for delivering our industry-leading safety metrics.","As we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on our strengths, our aggregates-focused business, our outstanding geographic footprint and local execution capabilities, particularly around those things we can control. Our four strategic initiatives will ensure continued improvement in unit margins. Now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will start with Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Elliott","Can you comment on what you're seeing on the cost side? I know you like to talk about the incrementals on more of a trailing basis as opposed from quarter-to-quarter. Were there any one-off stripping costs or anything else that might have popped up? Just curious.","James Hill","Yes. On the third quarter, the cost increase were really based in two areas. One was planned, higher repair and maintenance on stationary equipment, particularly some big crusher repairs that we did or rebuilds that we did. And also, we took one of our big drag lines down in Florida and made some major repairs on it. The second area was extra blue water shipping costs as we took our older ship into dry dock and we're using contract ships at much higher cost.","That ship is back in the fleet at this point. So that's behind us. And as you pointed out, year-to-date, we've also - not so much in the quarter, but year-to-date, we experienced some higher stripping costs in preparation for higher volumes from highway demand. If you think about all these costs are planned long-term investments in anticipation of improving volumes. But again, as you had talked about - if you look at what we always guided you through the trailing 12-month same-store flow-through was at 60%, which is where we would guide you to be.","Suzanne Wood","And just picking up on Tom's point, I'd also add that, as he said, we always guide toward 60% on a trailing 12-month basis. And if you look at, just pick the last eight quarters, we've got quarters ranging with flow-throughs in the specific quarter ranging from 41% to just over 100%. So it's really difficult to look at a particular quarter when you've got 350 mines and lots of different things going on. That's why we always guide to the trailing 12 months to smooth some of those things out, Stanley.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. Understood. And then just as a second question, kind of looking out to 2020 on the low- to mid-single-digit volume growth. I know you don't want to give too much color here, but maybe a couple of states that maybe you're most excited about looking at the upcoming year?","James Hill","Yes. I would point you to the - really pretty much across footprint, but the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast will be strong. Parts of Texas will be strong. California with SB 1 kicking in, should be good. As you said, it's - we're actually right in the middle of the planning for 2020. So it's early. On the private side, we still see growth in shipments to res and nonres sectors, and they've been strong, particularly strong in '19.","If you kind of said, what are you - there's some watches there, which we called out San Francisco, Dallas, Miami and Chicago. But we had talked about Nashville, but Nashville, we actually think has gotten a second win and is doing quite well on the private side. We've got most of our markets shipping really strong on private. Highway demand and shipments, as we talked about, is going to be very good, and will continue to grow, not just 2020, but years to - a number of years to come. We have tried to be thoughtful in that low to mid-single-digit in '23 because it's really early in the process. And we'll obviously give you a much better look at this in February.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. I'll now move to the next question, Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Shifting to California, know that SB 1 has been great. Would love to get an update on progress. And give any color of what is the impact of fires have had on construction projects.","James Hill","Yes. SB 1 continues to be well. We saw it double and up through from where it was passed in '17 through this year. Then next year, they'll add another $1 billion to it. As you know, we got a slow start this year because we just got rained out in the first five months. But now we're shipping strong both with aggregates and asphalt. So things are picking up in California.","On the fires, we've recently seen some delays from fires. And I think we'll have those, and we will have those, but as you know, the work doesn't go away, and we will be there. Most importantly, our people are all okay and their homes are all okay. We - as far as power outages, which is another part of that, we've not seen any to our aggregates operations. We've seen a little bit to our ready-mix operations, but no impact from that at this point.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, great then. And really, this is more a broad downstream question for you. Just a little bit more color in terms of the regional market impacted with the asphalt timing and with Concrete gross profit. We had great volume and pricing, but the gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was off year-over-year. Maybe a little color on that.","James Hill","Yes. As we talked about with Asphalt, we would have thought it would have done a little bit better this year. We actually had a good quarter and that the gross profit was up 60%, really driven by volume. The - what we would tell you where we - the shortfall in Asphalt would have been volume in California just because of the rains in the first part of the year, but the demand is there, and that will flow into 2020. We were a little slower on catch up on unit margins than we would have anticipated. But I think what we saw - the good news is we saw, in the second and third quarter, that unit margins were virtually flat.","So price has - liquid costs as we look forward to 2020, we would see based on backlogs and booking pace, our prices in hot mix going up. And we would expect, at worst case, liquid cost to be flat. So I think as we look forward to 2020, really good news for this product line. The highway demand will drive volumes up in Asphalt. And I think that now that liquid has stabilized, we'll see unit margin start to improve. So I look forward to this product line in 2020.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital.","Michael Dahl","First question I had, and I might not have heard properly, but just around the costs and margins in the quarter in aggs. It sounds like they were a bit lower than your internal plans, but then, Tom, the comments you made around planned maintenance and added Blue Water shipping. I wasn't clear if those were increases that you had contemplated in your plan or if those were the reasons for the increased cost versus your internal expectations or just any additional puts and takes there that you may not have contemplated.","James Hill","Yes. Both of those - well, all of that was planned, but it was an increase over prior year, but it was planned. I think as you kind of look at, to Suzanne's point, if you look at the cost profile in the Aggregates business, it's going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. It's just the nature of the beast. You have 350 facilities. You have to do the right thing at the right time in each of those, whether that's stripping or whether that's a big repair on a crusher or as we did pulling out dragline down. And if you - if in you - the - so the timing always is in big flux because you - all three of those 50 may or may not hit at once, it may hit at different times. And you can't really procrastinate those things. You need to do it when you need to do it or they'll cost you more.","It'll lead to downtime, it'll lead to failures. So for the long-term nature of the business, you inspect it and fix it when it needs to be fixed or you strip when it needs to be stripped. We talked about that a lot in Tampa with inspecting and maintenance and timely owned equipment. But if I step back and look at it and put my operator's hat on, I am very confident in our ability to pull through that 60% on a regular basis for the long haul, but you won't do it quarterly.","And if you look at trailing 12 months, we've done that. I mean, that's our track record. And that's what we'll always guide you to. But quarterly, because of the nature or the long-term nature of the beast and just doing what you got to do in each one of those individual mines, it's going to be lumpy by nature.","Michael Dahl","Okay, understood. Second question is just around the guidance. And Suzanne, I appreciate the thoughtfulness throughout the year. I guess, just to press on the implied 4Q guide a bit. The low end of the implied guide would have you down year-on-year on EBITDA. So I guess, just to be - to just want some clarification of whether it doesn't seem from the outside that there's anything that would produce that type of outcome, given volume and price, but is there anything you're seeing there? Or is it really just you've had this annual guide out how - and you may be tracking towards the midpoint or better, but just didn't feel the urgency to take up the low end?","James Hill","I think I'll comment on the market and then let Suzanne comment on the financials. The works there, I think we feel good about our backlogs and our booking pace and we support our outlook, both for the full year and for 2020. But as always, in the fourth quarter, it's just a matter of how many shipping days you're going to have before the year is out. I think you saw that last year. We actually ran out of time when we pull work into the first quarter of 2019. So it's first in - first - fourth quarter and first quarter are always just iffy because of the time of year it is. But the underlying fundamentals, the pricing, the demand, all those fundamentals are there, and we feel very good about it.","Suzanne Wood","Yes. And I would just add on to that, that's the guide that's been in place all year. We're still comfortable within that range, as you indicated. Hopefully, at the - at\/or around the midpoint of the range, but it depends on the number of shipping days. So I wouldn't - I would not read anything into the fact that we didn't raise the lower end of the range. We just decided to leave it in place, but nothing in our outlook for the year has changed. And indeed, if you look at the results that we have produced year-to-date, I mean, we are on a good pathway to achieve that.","Operator","Now moving to a question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","So I'm wondering if you could talk about the pricing announcements that you've made for 2020. What's the breadth of pricing actions? Or is it more or less mid-single digits across the board? Or is there more of a variability by market? And in terms of the pricing actions that you're taking, are they more significant than what we've seen in those comparable markets in '18 in areas where you're pushing pricing above the company average for '20?","James Hill","As always, they're going to be - there'll be variability, and that's just because different markets have different cadences of you push price for a while and then you let it catch up and then you push price for a while. So those will all be a little different. I think that the pricing dynamics in all markets is good. I believe we'll see price - real price increases in the vast majority, if not all, of our markets. Our backlog, our booking pace would support that mid-single. Our conversations with our fixed-plant customers, I think, would support that.","Again, we're still - we're in the middle of this, and we're still early in the process. That's our best thoughtful guide at this point. We'll give you a more educated view of this in - as we have a volume in February. But the very strong shipments on the private side, coupled with the visibility of the dramatically growing highway work, really support pricing throughout the sector, not just aggregates, but I think all construction materials and construction. We'll end this year strong, and I think we'll start into 2020 with very good momentum.","Jerry Revich","And Tom, I'm wondering if you could expand on your prior comments you had made in your prepared remarks on infrastructure project cadence. So clearly, the backlog is healthy. We've seen some lumpy awards activity. California, in particular, comes to mind. Can you just talk about over what time frame would we see a - would we need to see a re-acceleration in lettings to have a steady project cadence and avoid holes in the schedule, if you will?","James Hill","It's really hard to predict holes in the schedule. I think that if you look at starts, for example, which is - has been - if you look at starts, which looks kind of like they would be down a little bit. You got to remember that the value of those starts is up to 20% over two years ago. So we're - number one, we're playing at a much higher level.","And then you've also seen, with these big increases, massive increases in funding, you're seeing much larger projects. So the starts metric is now very lumpy, where shipments, those big projects, will ship over a number of years. So the nature of that leading indicator has changed a little bit. Let me give you an example. If you look at the job that we're shipping today, which is I-66 in Northern Virginia, it dropped into the starts in April of 2018 at $2.3 billion. So it just skewed the value of the starts, as we compare it to April, year-over-year, but that job is shipping, and it'll ship for four years.","So that - the big projects have made that a little bit lumpy. I think if you look at, overall, you just look at the value of what's going on in the states. And I'll just run through 8 and 9 for you, Florida. The - it will be up - lettings will be up 25% this year. Georgia lettings will more than double over the next 2 years from $1.4 billion to $3 billion. Texas' budget goes from $26 billion to over $31 billion. Virginia DoT and regional authorities goes from $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion from a budget perspective. Highway lettings and how we're spending in South Carolina will be up 10%. Tennessee is up 40% over a two year time frame. And California, as I said earlier, it's up since 2017, $1.7 billion, it increased another $1 billion in 2020. So there's a lot of work out there and a lot of work to come. Timing, we'll just have to see what happens. But it's - again, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's not if, it's when.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.","Trey Grooms","So just looking at the elevated cost or for planned cost that occurred in Q3, is there any - is there anything we should be aware of as we're looking into 4Q when it comes to any of these costs that might be occurring in that time?","James Hill","Not dramatic. I think it's - again, it's the timing of when those fall in individual plants, but I wouldn't - nothing's changed in our fundamental cost structure. Again, it's going to be lumpy. It's going to be lumpy by a quarter. But - and I'm actually pleased with the disciplines that we're instilling for the long term of what happens in operating efficiencies. I mean, you got to rebuild crushers, you got to rebuild drag lines, and those are going to come at different times. But the underlying fundamentals that really drive the cost of efficiencies of tons per man-hour, tons per hour downtime, those kind of things, I think we've continually pushed the ball forward and improved on it.","Trey Grooms","Okay. And with the Asphalt business, unit margins taking the - margins improved, I guess, but it was on volume. Just - and it sounded like most of the downside to your guide on that side of the business was due to volume and timing there. So - I didn't understand that correctly.","James Hill","Yes. So let me see if I can explain it to you. The - there's a mixed bag in the shortfall of guidance was volume and volume in California. We just got a - we just shortened the year with the rain in the first five months. So that was one piece of it. The other piece of it is, we thought we would start improving unit margins faster than we have, and that's really price of hot mix catching the cost of liquid. I think - well, the good news of that is what we saw in Q2 and Q3 was we caught it. We're virtually flat.","Now as we look into 2020, we know that based on our backlogs, that our prices are up. We believe that, in a worst case, liquid will probably be around flat. So you should start seeing units. So as you look into 2020, we think we'll see unit margin expansion. Because we don't - we're not chasing at all anymore, and we've continued to be able to raise prices on a hot - on the hot mix side. If you look at demand going into 2020, it's pretty simple. We know what's happening with lettings and highway spending, and that's a big driver of asphalt volumes. So again, we're doing the plan right now. We can't give you guidance, but we'll be clear on that when we talk to you in February.","Trey Grooms","Okay. It sounds like improvement nonetheless.","James Hill","Yes.","Trey Grooms","And last one for me, just on the FAST Act expiring next year. What's your expectation for, I guess, right now, any update on your kind of thought of how it shakes out and what the response is from the Fed? And then at this point, I guess? And then do you expect states to hit the pause button at all as we move closer to that expiration date?","James Hill","I'll take the second part of that first, and the answer is absolutely not. The states will move forward. They have a substantial amount of funding, and they will have political pressure to spend that funding and improve their roads, improve their infrastructure because their voters said, we've voted on this to make our roads better. So they'll make sure that happens. Again, timing, we will see. If you look at the highway bill, the simple part of that is the funding is not going to go down if we don't get a bill, which I don't think we will. In election year, then they'll - we'll have extensions. If you look - and so I don't - I have faith and that, that spending will continue, and infrastructure will be supported.","If you look a little further out to the Highway Bill. You've heard me say this, the House is actually working on a bill right now. Policymakers are working on the reauthorization package as we speak. The Environmental Public Works Committee is working on a bill, which would increase funding by roughly 28%.","Again, we'll see what happens. But the feds are not going to let it go down and our states' funding in our states is up $20 billion a year. So - and that is now flowing into shipments. So I think demand is going to continue to grow over the next 7 or 8 years, but what we know right now. Now, and I believe we'll, right up to the election, there'll be a drive to get another federal build on.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.","Michael Wood","I appreciate the comments that you made in the Q&A session here on Asphalt and non-Aggregates. But I'm curious with - you're essentially flat in the non-Ag businesses year-to-date. And curious why we wouldn't start to see an improving trend in fourth quarter. Does that give you any concern at all for the ability to grow those non-aggregates into 2020?","James Hill","Well, fourth quarter is just tough to predict on asphalt. And again, it's - remember asphalt, you've got to lay it at 45 degrees in rising. So you just don't know when in different markets we're in, when you got to stop laying asphalt. I think the fundamentals - so that's kind of why I look forward to 2020. I think that the fundamentals for 2020 are very good, and we don't give quarterly guidance. But the fourth quarter is just hard to call anyway, particularly with asphalt because of the temperature sensitivity of the product line.","Suzanne Wood","That's right. And if you go back to when we had some similar discussions around this in the first quarter on asphalt, we would have said exactly the same thing, Michael. It's just Q4 and Q1 are just iffy because of the temperatures.","Michael Wood","Understood. And as a follow-up, the aggregates freight-adjusted selling price, there's not a lot of movement quarter-over-quarter. Curious if there's any mix impacts that you didn't call out besides the geographic. Because I would think as projects roll off, given your success with prior price increases, you would see at least a steady upward drift.","James Hill","So I think we did have a little bit of mix, and it was 5.6%, up $0.75, but mix was - mix-adjusted went up 5%. It was about half product in that geographic. The product was, well, clean stone sizes, particularly asphalt sizes, again driven by the highway demand. And then the geographic mix was higher volumes in Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. I think if you look at our backlogs, booking pace, again, it would support that mid-single digit. And I think that's - is - not all markets are created equal and the timing of those is different. But again, early to tell. We got work to do on that. We'll give you a lot clearer guidance in February.","Operator","Now moving to Paul Roger with Exane BNP.","Paul Roger","Nice to be on the call today. I'll just move away from the trading, if I may, and focus a little bit on capital allocation. Obviously, your balance sheet is in quite a nice position now. Actually, some of your competitors have also talked started increasing the sort of M&A pipeline. Is that the type of thing you're seeing and how you want to look out for deals over the next [indiscernible].","Suzanne Wood","Yes, we will - I mean, our capital allocation policy is unchanged. We've talked about that a number of times, so I'll just speak specifically to the M&A part of your question. I mean, look, we certainly like and prefer same-store growth. It's the most profitable and the least risky, but deals come along. We look at those all the time. We've looked at a number of them this year, but we are very picky about those we do. They have to hit a certain very specific set of criteria. They have to fit well in terms of geography product to move us forward. We have specific returns characteristics so we continue to look, and we pass on a fair number because they don't hit those very high hurdle rates, but there are a few in the pipeline, and we will see which ones get to the finish line.","Paul Roger","Okay. That's very clear. And then just going back to the Asphalt business. I mean, you've obviously given some color on your expectations for 2020 anyway. I'm just wondering, is there any sort of structural reason why this can't be a sort of mid- to high-teens margin business again? And also, do you expect any impact from IMO 2020 in terms of deflation on the cost side?","James Hill","I think as far as the unit margins, that may be a little bit aggressive. Obviously, I agree with you, I'd love to have that, but it maybe a little aggressive on double-digit margin improvement, it - without help from liquid. Now if you get help from liquid, it's a different story. As far as IMO 2020. I think, again, we're early in the planning. I think we would be the mindset that, right now, liquid, at worst case, is flat to slightly up at worst case. But again, I don't know that we have clear enough visibility in 2020 at this point to make a call on liquid.","Operator","And now we will hear from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.","Rohit Seth","We talked a lot about the public. But on the housing side, builders are benefiting from lower rates. Their orders have been really strong. Just curious if you've seen a pickup on the housing side for your business and maybe what you could share what growth was like across the footprint during the quarter.","James Hill","Yes. For the year, shipments to residential market have been high single-digit. We're carrying really strong shipment momentum into 2020. Most recently, if you look at the trailing three month permits and starts and our markets are up. As you said, the fundamental drivers for housing are still very good, population growth, employment growth, low interest rates on houses and low inventories of houses. I mean, there's - most of our markets, there's just not much inventory or at an all-time low. So if you look at residential demand, we should a pretty good momentum - at this point, we believe we'll carry a pretty good momentum into 2020.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And maybe you can talk about what you - where the shipment growth was this quarter by geography.","James Hill","Yes. It was actually pretty good throughout our footprint, particularly strong in Mid-Atlantic, Southeast. Coastal Texas was very strong. South Texas was strong. Southern and Central California were strong. Tennessee was - East Tennessee was very good.","Suzanne Wood","And although you didn't ask, I'll offer that on the pricing side, very widespread virtual - well, every one of the key markets experienced year-over-year price increases. So that was nice to see as well.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And then last one, if I can here. At the Analyst Day, you talked about gross profit - unit profits rising to about mid-8s. And then we saw like incrementals come in here that reminds us that the best incremental margins, I mean, for us to model is about 60%. There was no intention there to suggest that maybe incrementals would be better as we go forward into - over the next few years. Is that right?","James Hill","I think we would take you right back to 60% over the long haul. And again, in any quarter, you're going to have quarters that will be much above 60%, you'd have quarters where we will be way below 60, but on a long - and I talked about that because of the lumpy nature of the cost and the timing of that is you have to do it when you need - you need to do it when you need to do it for the good of the business and the long-term profitability of the business, but I think we'd always bring you back to 60%.","Operator","And our next question will now come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","A competitor of yours talked about the shifts in the mix of business moving towards large-scale highway work and less away from bridge work at this point in the cycle. So just curious if you're seeing that? And if so, how does that impact your outlook from an aggregates intensity standpoint for volumes and potentially from a price\/mix standpoint moving forward?","James Hill","I think you're going to see more. What you'll see is capacity in these large projects. And even in smaller projects, I think they're going to be a lot aimed at just laying capacity because we're so constrained. Obviously, there'll be maintenance in there, but that is very good news for us because laying capacity is the most intensive demand used for aggregates of any we have, including just within highway. So as we look forward, I think we would see improved maintenance, but most importantly, and most of the money is going to be with laying capacity, which is the most aggregate-intensive.","Garik Shmois","Okay. And just a quick one. There were some concerns around Hurricane Dorian impacting the timing of volumes in the quarter. I was wondering if you ended up seeing any of that and if that delay in Florida and in the Southeast might end up being shifting some project work into the fourth quarter.","James Hill","We didn't see a lot of that. And if you'd noticed, this is - we've not used the W word once in this call. So we're pleased with that. But I don't know that we saw a lot of impact from Dorian. If it was, it was fairly brief, but it didn't really hit our radar.","Operator","Timna Tanners with Bank of America will have the next question.","Timna Tanners","I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit some of the other cost trends like labor in particular and any other freight costs just for starters. If you could discuss that and any other major components we should be thinking out about.","James Hill","I think the buckets I would put cost in was - fuel was slightly down. Labor cost, as far as cost per hour, I wouldn't - not a big change. Minor, but not a big change. The shipping cost we talked about was we had one of our ships in Blue Water, and that's behind us and that our - the Vulcan ship is back in service. But the primary cost driver for us in the quarter, as far as the delta, was the higher planned repair and maintenance on stationary equipment. That was the big one besides the ships.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to make you repeat that. I was thinking more going forward.","James Hill","No, it's okay. No, no.","Timna Tanners","Like your labor or your cost going forward, a big issue? Or do you think that's been contained? Because I know that's something that you've been talking about for a while.","James Hill","I think there's pressures on labor cost going forward. I think what we're focused on is the disciplines and efficiencies to mitigate labor cost, and those are how we run those plants and how we best utilize our men and women who run the quarries.","Timna Tanners","Okay, super. And then circling back on the capital allocation discussion. You may have had a nice step change in returns and just trying to think about what are your priorities in terms of organic growth. I know you talked about M&A already, but organic growth versus repurchases, you did a few, and also dividends.","James Hill","I think our biggest growth engine, well, as always, will be our organic growth and the change of high single-digit to double - low double-digit to our unit margins and those four strategic initiatives where we are actively trying to improve those and with a lot of discipline and process. Obviously, we're going to look for M&A. As Suzanne said, we're going to be disciplined about it. We look at a lot of those. And they have to fit our profile. They have to fit what we want. And the key there is to be disciplined. And so - but again, the key here is improving that unit margin day in and day out.","Suzanne Wood","And I think you mentioned dividends. I mean, we look at the dividend as a progressive one. Our - it's clearly a board decision, but our view is that we should, particularly with our cash generation, which, as you'll note, we raised our discretionary cash flow guidance by about $10 million for the year versus last quarter. We'll continue to look at the dividend and the plan would be to generally raise it in line with our earnings growth to a level that we're absolutely certain we can maintain throughout the cycle.","Operator","Now we'll hear from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.","Adam Thalhimer","I wanted to ask first on the - what are you hearing from your Washington group on the risk of rescission? It looks like Texas might have to repay the federal government $600 million next year. I mean, do you think that actually happens? Or do you think somebody, they step in and fix them?","James Hill","No. I think the threat of the FAST Act rescission going to effect is slim to none. I think what this will do is help Congress find a way to pass a repeal of the session. The feds are not going to cut funding.","Adam Thalhimer","Good. I was hoping you would say that. And then as it relates to incremental margins, we've had a couple of years here where it's kind of trended below 60%. I'm just curious, for a model - modeling purposes out to 2020, I mean, would you like us to stick in 60%? Or is it better to stick in 50% and work it higher as the year goes on?","James Hill","We would guide you to 60%. Now in any given quarter. Obviously, I've just talked about, it's going to be quite volatile. In any given year, you're going to be plus or minus, something around 60%, but you're always going to come back over time to that 60% number, and that's how we guide you.","Suzanne Wood","Well, as an example, for the full year 2018, it was 64%. We would still - we'd still guide you back to 60%.","James Hill","Yes, the year before that was a little below 60%, right. Right now, we're at 60%, so we'll guide you back to 60%.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. I mean, to get to 60% for this year, it implies that margins up in Q4 in aggs? So I just - that's kind of why I wanted to focus on 2020 because I'm just not sure margins can go up in aggs in Q4.","James Hill","Well, I think that we're always trying to drive margin ups on aggs once in a quarter over the year, that's fundamentally what we're doing. And that is the thing that we can control there is improvement in unit margins, and that's what we're focused on as well as servicing our customers, so we are not sure we're up for the volume.","Operator","We'll now hear from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng","It sounds like your conversations with your customers on pricing have been pretty constructive, and I know it's early. Are there any pockets or markets where you could see like a midyear increase in 2020?","James Hill","I would - it's way too early, Phil, that, we're not even through the plan of 2020 and beginning-of-the-year price increases. Usually, there will be - normally when you have rising demand, you will have a few markets where you're able to - the whole market can accept midyear price increases, and that's not just in aggregates that kind of flow-through. It just depends. But I think - so from - if you just step back and look at what happens in over the last 5 or 6 years, there'll be - there's usually that - the vast majority of time, there's a few markets where will take midyear price increases.","But you got to remember, we're talking about the fixed-plant pricing on, which is 40% of the business. The 6% of bid work is you're pricing dozens of quotes day in and day out. And in those markets - and those things, we're always trying to push price forward. And that's part of our commercial excellence and what we work hard on is to earn that - to earn - to serve our customers where we earn those price increases. But that happens day in and day out.","Philip Ng","Got it. That's helpful color. I know it's really early, and I appreciate you giving us some color for 2020. Your volume outlook seems very reasonable to me, but it's also reflecting some modest deceleration from the last few years. With housing reaccelerating and pretty healthy backlogs in public, just curious what's driving some of that deceleration. And are there any end markets that are a little less strong from your perspective?","James Hill","I think I would describe that this way. I think we're just trying to be thoughtful because it's very early, and we don't have our plans. This is our best estimate at this time. So it's not trying - we're not trying to signal, at all, any deceleration. I think what we're trying to do is just be thoughtful because we don't have the plan yet.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Tom Hill for closing comments.","James Hill","Thank you. I thank all of you for your time and your interest in Vulcan Materials. As you can see, the business continues to operate well, and we look forward to discussing this with you throughout the quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"21954":["Vulcan Materials Co.

My name is Yolanda, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, please begin, sir.","Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available on our website supplemental information for your review and use. Rather than walk through each slide on this call, we will focus on the highlights.","With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. You know, it's a very exciting time to be in the Construction Materials business. We have great momentum, and we are as well-positioned as I've ever seen us and we're looking forward to a strong year in 2017 and looking past 2017. Our foundation for sustained growth is as strong as I've ever seen it in my 27 years with the company. Our fourth quarter results didn't match up with the prior year's fourth quarter, which was exceptionally strong in a tough comp. This comparison was affected in a large part because of an earlier end to the construction season in 2016, and also due to continued volume weakness in our California, Illinois and coastal Texas businesses.","With the exception of these three areas, fourth quarter aggregate shipments were relatively strong compared to 2015. October-November shipments exceeded the prior year's strong comps, before falling off in the second half of December. This is even with a slowdown in new construction starts during the election cycle with its related uncertainty. Lower shipments volumes and production brought lower fixed cost absorption. At the same time, we made the right investments to support the increasing production we see coming in 2017. These basic and necessary investments to support growth in repair and maintenance and stripping, along with variances in end of the year accounting accruals negatively impacted our unit margins.","But stepping back and looking at the full year and our underlying performance trends, what you see is continued compounding improvements in our execution, our service to customers, and in our profitability. We are of the strong view that we are in a long, multi-year recovery where we will continue to build our profitability, our franchise and deliver for our shareholders, our customers and our people. In fact, a longer recovery will enhance profitability as we benefit from further improvements in unit margins, pricing and operating leverage.","Here's what we delivered in 2016. 16% growth in adjusted EBITDA, 22% growth in adjusted EBIT, 90% growth in net earnings and 24% growth in cash provided by operations. These numbers reflect our continued success in making meaningful improvements to our underlying profitability, that includes 7% growth in aggregate freight-adjusted average selling prices in 2016, and 14% growth in aggregates gross profit per ton, a record level. We also saw further improvements in asphalt and concrete material margins and a 280 basis point gain in total company gross profit margin, and we achieved important pricing and unit margins across nearly all of our markets. Our 2016 results set us up nicely for 2017 and beyond. Our assets are positioned extremely well to serve the continued recovery in materials demand.","The pricing climate remains constructive. Our operating disciplines will enable us to grow margins faster than pricing, and we have the financial strength and flexibility to grow, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders. Combining our strong cash generation and incremental debt capacity, we may have approximately $5 billion to either invest for growth or return to shareholders between now and return to mid-cycle shipment levels. I'll comment more on M&A later in the call. Let me just say now that I like what I see with the acquisitions landscape, and our disciplined pursuit of these opportunities. Now, we faced some volume changes \u2013 challenges in 2016 that I don't expect to repeat this year. You might simply say that we should face easier comparisons later in the year, but let me briefly touch on a few examples.","In Texas, our aggregate shipments were down 10% year-over-year given several large project delays and prolonged bad weather. However, shipments in Texas began to strengthen in the fourth quarter. With our North and South Texas areas running ahead of last year's strong pace, we expect volume growth in Texas in 2017. California continue to lag expectations, although we began to see improvements in shipments in some markets, along with continued improvements in pricing. California's failure to address its declining transportation infrastructure in 2016 along with deferred construction on a number of large non-residential projects contributed to the low in our California business. Recent trends suggest those factors will change in 2017. We expect California like Texas to grow in 2017. Illinois also continued to lag, but not at the same pace of decline and pricing was strong. We believe that our Illinois business will hold steady in 2017.","The remainder of our business showed strong growth in 2016, on the order of approximately 10% aggregate shipment growth and 6% pricing growth in total. For the most part, we expect that momentum \u2013 the momentum to continue throughout 2017. For example, look at important markets in the Southeast, which enjoyed robust double-digit growth in 2016. South Carolina volume was up 17%, Florida volumes grew by 15%, and Georgia was up 20%. By the way, all of these markets should see double-digit volume gains again in 2017. John will walk us through our expectations for 2017 in a moment. But the bottom line is that we expect another strong year, on track with our longer term, our longer range goals, a year with growth in adjusted EBITDA of approximately 15% to 25%. So we are excited about 2017 and we're excited about the business well beyond 2017.","As I look across our markets, the foundation is in place for an extended recovery, with growth in public construction spending just beginning to join the growth we have been seeing in private construction. And while I'm encouraged by the attention we see the Federal Government giving to sustain investment in our nation's infrastructure, our views regarding an extended recovery and demand are grounded in what's happening right now. In the November election, continuing a nationwide secular trend, ballot measures passed in Los Angeles County, San Francisco, Greater Atlanta, and South Carolina added $1.7 billion annually in infrastructure spending in these markets.","Other states are poised for action this year. In California, work is progressing quickly in the Senate and Assembly with support from the Governor to increase transportation funding by $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Tennessee and South Carolina also have announced new highway funding proposals that stand a good chance of being enacted this year. So, the momentum continues to build. Voters across the country are demanding that something be done to catch up on decades of underinvestment in public infrastructure.","The LA County measure passed with 70% of the vote. That's voters passing a tax increase on themselves, and nationwide, 74% of state and local ballot measures calling for transportation improvements passed during the 2016 election season. Now, certainly more is needed. Federal investment is, in physical infrastructure, as a percentage of GDP is at 0.5%, lower than it's been in decades, and far below levels of investment and \u2013 or in other developed nations. But notwithstanding the need for significant new investment, the foundations for a sustained and extended recovery demand are already in place, and there is no construction materials company in the United States that is better positioned to take advantage of that ongoing recovery than Vulcan.","Now I'll hand it off to John to walk you through our 2017 outlook. Then I'll close by addressing our M&A activities and other investments in growth. John?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. As you saw outlined in our release, our performance expectations for 2017 line up with the business's trajectory since the second half of 2013, when the recovery in our part of the economy began, as well as with the longer range goals we've discussed previously. To give you a bit more color, I'll check through some of the expectations underpinning our guidance range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion in adjusted EBITDA. And I'll provide some comments regarding the timing in what could be a back-half-loaded year with uneven quarterly comparisons.","I'll start with aggregate shipments, where we anticipate volume of between 190 million and 196 million tons or between 5% and 8% growth over 2016. Consistent with the preliminary outlook we shared during our September Investor Meeting in Atlanta, we expect year-over-year shipment growth across all end-use segments, residential, private non-res, public transportation and other public infrastructure and in nearly all of our geographic units.","Construction materials demand continues to recover and to recover broadly. Longer-term project pipelines, what has been called the water behind the dam, continues to build. As it relates to our ultimate 2017 shipments, the key question may not be around demand per se, but rather around the pace at which the end-to-end construction sector can move to meet that demand. The recent improvement in construction starts we have seen serves as a positive leading indicator, particularly for the second half of the year. However, we still see constrained construction capacity for certain types of jobs in certain geographies. This uncertainty regarding shipment timing drives our wider range regarding 2017 tonnage.","As Tom noted, the overall pricing climate remains positive. For aggregates pricing, we see a gain in freight adjusted average selling prices of between 5% and 7%. Price increases announced for our fixed plant customers have generally been well-received. The momentum in aggregates pricing reflects the confidence market participants have in the sustained recovery, as well as the continued focus by material producers on earning adequate returns on capital. It also reflects a number of construction markets that are effectively supply constrained in the short term, similar to the pricing dynamics that you see in housing, for example.","To the extent improved product mix balances, including higher sales rates for fines and base material, negatively impacts reported average selling prices, it should also improve total cash flows. In other words, it would be a good thing. Again, we expect unit margins in our Aggregates segment to expand faster than the rate of pricing growth. For our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments, we expect gross profit growth of approximately 15% in total, driven primarily by volume recovery and improving material margins in concrete. We do not expect the recent growth in SAG expenses to repeat in 2017. The SAG increase in 2016 over 2015 was driven primarily by incentives tied to the company's financial performance and stock price, certain investments in sales and customer service capabilities, as well as elevated legal and other outside service expenses.","Operating and maintenance CapEx for 2017 should be approximately $300 million. This figure includes some carryover from 2016, during which time our expenditures were approximately $250 million as compared to our original guidance of $275 million. These figures exclude our internal growth capital investments, such as opening of new rail yards, railcars or our Panamax-class ships. All in all, we expect another year of strong growth in net earnings, EBITDA and cash provided by operations amidst what for now appears to be an extended recovery in demand in materials shipments. We will persist with our focus on continuous compounding improvements in safety, in our operating performance, in our unit margins, and in our capital productivity. We've entered 2017 in a very strong financial position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from those discussed previously, and we're in a position to balance reinvestment in our current franchise, M&A and other growth capital investments, and returning capital to shareholders.","Now, before handing it back over to Tom, I'd like to offer a few thoughts regarding the timing of revenue and earnings growth throughout the year. We don't give quarterly guidance, as you know, nor do we intend to. However, we do want to remind you that 2017 growth, especially on a quarterly year-over-year comparison basis, could be weighted toward the last three quarters or perhaps even the second half of the year. We expect our shipment momentum to build throughout the year as FAST Act funds begin to drive new construction activity, and as the recent improvement in construction starts begins to impact our business with its typical lag.","In addition, and I know this is hardly news to most of you listening, the business faces tougher comparisons in the beginning of the year than it does later in the year. For example, last year's first quarter saw a 17% increase in aggregates volume over the prior year, driven by unusually favorable weather and exceptionally strong large project shipments. And in contrast, the fourth quarter of 2016 was obviously not nearly as strong. Per these examples, we continue to encourage investors to focus on longer-term trends in order to understand the performance and value of the business. And from our perspective, those key trends, multiple years of volume recovery, a positive pricing climate, strong operating leverage, and accelerating growth in free cash flows remain substantially unchanged.","Tom, back over to you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, John. At Vulcan, we've moved into 2017 with a great deal of confidence. Our business has come a long way over the last three years, and we intend to maintain that momentum. 2016, a year where we grew EBITDA by 16% on only a 2% gain in aggregates shipments really sets us up for a year that won't see the same volume headwinds. Certainly we are encouraged by the discussions taking place regarding infrastructure investment and corporate tax reform. The country needs these changes. Vulcan's working families need these changes, and yes, Vulcan shareholders also stand to benefit. We have the wind at our back. Our job, internally, as always is to focus on what we can control to serve our customers extraordinarily well, to operate safely and efficiently, and to deliver better and better returns from the capital that we deploy.","At Vulcan, we're not satisfied with tailwinds. We're going to raise our internal expectations. We're going to raise our disciplines and our intensity another notch. We're not waiting for National Policy improvements to make our own business better. That's our job, and that's the job we're going to do. If we do that, we'll help our country grow and regain a competitive edge. We'll create jobs and opportunity for our people and we'll be even better positioned to grow for many years to come. Now, on the topic of growth and in particular acquisition-led growth, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on the M&A landscape as we see it today and our approach to it. You likely saw a number of recent bolt-on acquisitions referenced in our press release.","This may appear to be a pickup in activity after a period of relative quiet. But I'll tell you, we've been working hard on this all along, and we'll continue to work hard on it. The acquisitions noted in our release represent attractive additions to our positions in markets ranging from Nashville, to Dallas, to Albuquerque. In each instance, we're not only getting bigger, but we're also improving our capabilities to service our customers efficiently and effectively. John noted that we have the financial strength to invest for growth while maintaining the overall flexibility and resilience of our balance sheet. We're first and foremost going to maintain discipline and how we use our financial strength, but I expect you'll continue to see bolt-on acquisitions.","These will add to our already strong organic growth trajectory and to the lasting value of our market positions over the long-term. And of course, acquisitions aren't the only growth investments we make. During 2016 for example, we invested in five new rail yards in markets such as Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina. So to wrap up, I'll note again that these are exciting times at Vulcan Materials. We're facing an extended recovery with the impact of the FAST Act just beginning to kick in. We're seeing a significant pickup in state and local transportation funding across our footprint.","The pricing climate for our products remains constructive, and we're going to realize further profit margin improvements with multiple years of continued growth ahead. In addition, we enjoy the financial strength to pursue smart bolt-on acquisitions and other growth investments while also prudently returning capital to shareholders. Add to all of this, the potential for meaningful corporate tax reform and a sustained increase in infrastructure investment, I think it's easy to see why we are very excited about our future at Vulcan.","And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Certainly. And we'll go first to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. Congratulations on a very strong 2016. I was hoping you could just step me through the bridge in terms of the sequence of shipments from October, November, December because you guys sounded pretty bullish, I think, on your last update from November 3. And I was also hoping you could kind of give us a bridge on gross profit margin? I think John called out a couple items that affected fixed cost absorption like the timing of repair and maintenance work and stripping expenses, and whether those are like one-time costs that pertain to the quarter or whether kind of a normal incremental profitability that you guys generate will be visible as we move into the new year?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah Bob, it's Tom. I'll start first with the \u2013 how we saw volumes in the fourth quarter. October and November were actually from a rates \u2013 from a shipping rates perspective, were ahead of the prior year and going very strong. The bottom line through it, at least ran out of \u2013 we ran out of time on the construction season. In 2015, we were able to ship all the way to the end of the year. And depending on the market second week, first week, third week of December we just \u2013 the season ended, and it just \u2013 that's what caught us. So I think the demand going forward is there. We're confident in 2017. The works there, in fact, was really exciting. It's going to be when the construction season starts up and who knows when that's going to be. But when it does, we'll start to see the large highway projects, that FAST Act flowing through plus some of the big non-res projects will start shipping.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Bob, I'll take \u2013 I'll start with your second question, but again, just on volume and you probably saw this referred to in our release, total business for the quarter on a shipping rate basis up 2.5%, October-November combined, that's despite the challenges that we had in California and Coastal Texas and Illinois. And just to give you a contrast, December was down 11%. So, really good momentum, particularly in our core markets, if you \u2013 core Southeastern markets, those were actually up in the quarter for the full quarter. They're up about 9% October-November on a shipping rate basis, down 7% in December, just to give you a sense for the fall off relative to last year.","I'll highlight that because it kind of ties to your second question, Bob. There are really three big things in the quarter that affected unit margins in our Aggregates segment and gross profit margins in our Aggregates segment. And they're really all timing related. So the first thing we would say and call out is that the full year trends are the right trends to look at. The full year trends in terms of unit cost production being up 3% year-on-year, and then full year trends in terms of 14% improvement in unit gross profit margins in our Aggregates segment, those are the right numbers to focus on.","With that said, let me kind of say what happened in the quarter. Again, really about timing, we noted first in the quarter that our unit cost of production increased 13%. Again, that compares to a 3% increase for the full year. That's all about timing of cost. So that's about $0.89 of cost increase in the quarter, that contrasts to about $0.22 for the year. Again, the $0.22 is the right number. But that timing factor by itself, it was about $30 million impact in the quarter, and it's about a 500 basis point impact to gross profit margin. So that's the big driver, is timing and costs.","Again, look at the full-year trend, right numbers to look at. Two other factors; one, we called out pricing up. We had about $0.14 in the quarter of negative pricing mix both product and geographic. That's about another 100 basis points of impact on margin, still a very good thing for sales and cash flows, about a 100 basis point impact on stated gross profit margin. And then that volume fall off, it happened in \u2013 at the end of December, losing those incremental tons, which come at a higher rate of incremental gross profit. It had about another 100 basis point negative impact on margin in the quarter.","Add those up, it's about again $30 million of impact due to timing differences and unit cost of production. That's really the difference between $0.89 and $0.22 across 43 million tons. It's about $6 million with negative mix on pricing. And it's \u2013 on the incremental tons, we think if we lost about 2 million tons, it's probably another 18 million of gross profit with the associated revenue that came with it. So, that's the rough walk-through. That's the way we look at it, that I come back to looking at the full year numbers is the best indication of how the business is doing, 3% growth in unit cost in our Aggregate segment, 14% growth in gross profit per ton in our Aggregate segment. Those are reflective of really what's happening in the business and they're reflective of what you see in our guidance.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's extremely helpful and clarifies what I was trying to understand. One other question, and then I'll turn it over, kind of a high-level question. It seems like you're saying this cycle is going to be stronger for longer and you're talking about mid-cycle profitability, which kind of seems like it shifted out a little bit just due to timing situation but a lot of things are going to come on in the back half of the year. I haven't heard Tom sound this optimistic in a while, and he put that out that $5 billion number there, which is a huge number in terms of balance sheet leverage if you want to buy something and free cash flow generation. What are your thoughts on capital allocation for the next 12 to 24 months? And you guys have any new thinking around that as we move closer towards mid-cycle? Thanks and good luck.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll start with kind of a CFO view and then Tom might comment more on just the M&A landscape and how we're approaching it broadly. But our overall capital allocation priorities are unchanged. So we will \u2013 and the thing to take away is we got the flexibility to do all of these things. So it's about balance and not either or for us. We will continue to make investments back in our franchise so that's next year CapEx guidance of about $300 million. Again, that includes some carryover for this year. And again, you'll see accelerating free cash flow in the business.","We continue to have incremental debt capacity staying within our investment grade parameters. That could be roughly $2 billion of incremental capacity as we move through the recovery part of the cycle. We would expect dividend to continue to grow with earnings but we're very focused on the sustainability of that dividend. As Tom noted, we are actively involved, if not aggressive on the M&A trail. We're going to stay disciplined but we have a lot of really good opportunities there. We'll continue to pursue those. And then, we will continue to look to return excess cash after all those items to shareholders via opportunistic share repurchases that makes sense. Now, all those things with the same priorities we've talked about is just \u2013 we just know that we're entering 2017 in a really good position to pursue all those things. And Tom, I'll hand it off to you, maybe talk about M&A.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, Bob. I think that you saw us close a few that we noted in the press release. Don't be surprised if you see that pattern continue. We have a lot of conviction around the continuing improving cycle. And there is a lot of M&A opportunities out there, some of which we should be the clear owner of those. It's always difficult to predict timing, but what we will say is that we'll say, stay disciplined in our acquisition process. But I think you'll probably see this pattern continue.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Nice work guys. Stay in the course.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hey, Jerry.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm wondering if you could just flesh out for us some visibility that you have into the ramp up into the back half of 2017? You've been very clear that the first quarter is a tough comp for a while now. I'm just wondering, can you just give us some data points either large project bids or whatever underpins visibility on the significant ramp up in the back half of 2017? And within that context, can you just talk about what you're seeing in Texas specifically, that's giving you confidence that Texas will return to growth in 2017?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think that as we look at 2017, we see broad based growth in, of course, all of our segments and our geographic footprint. The Mid Atlantic and the Southeast continues to be very, very strong. As we look at our confidence \u2013 as far as the timing of that, it's really about when the construction season starts. The work's there. We have visibility of jobs, we backlog the jobs, they're ready to go, it's in every market we have, when does the sun come out and when we start shipping, and when does that begin. So, that will control the timing and that could be first quarter or second quarter, but it's going to start.","I'd like to touch for a minute on California. And as we said in California, it isn't if, it's really when and we're beginning to see that win come around, it's really going to be driven by the private side in California and we'd been very focused on the private side, particularly the non-residential, and I'm pleased with our team's execution on that. I would tell you in California, our customers are a lot more optimistic than they were a year ago. And we're beginning to see those large projects let and start, and we've backlogged a number of them. I'll give you a couple examples.","The new Rams Stadium, we'll start to ship in the next couple months, and this is 750,000 tons. The Mid-Coast Trolley extension in San Diego, again, it will start to ship whenever the season starts. It's about 200,000 tons. Silver Lake Reservoir is a really nice project for us because there's a lot of base and fines. And then the Otay Ranch residential project is a good example of the res that's going on in California. It's one of seven different phases of a residential project, and the first phase is 100,000 tons. And then, I'm pleased our team just closed on the LA Street contract, which is a five-year contract for asphalt, million tons of asphalt. So we're seeing California demand pick up, and it's \u2013 but, again, it's going to be driven by the private side. And I got to tell you, I'm feeling good about our execution in California and the team we have in place.","So moving to Texas, I think we expect good growth, continued growth in Texas. Look, the fundamentals in Texas are all there. It's still growing. We see employment growth in Texas. We see population growth in Texas. The oil bust impact at this point on employment has really about bottomed out. So those headwinds will go away. It has the most healthy highway program probably in the country, and highway work in 2017 is very much in our footprint both in aggregates and asphalt. On the private side, res and non-res continue to grow. We'd probably \u2013 again, we bottomed out in Houston, we'd probably see some small growth in Houston. So, we expect healthy growth in Texas in 2017.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And Tom, can you comment about the Coastal Texas specifically, how much of your exposure is directly or indirectly to large-scale ethylene and LNG projects? Is it possible to tell just so we're appropriately calibrated as those projects eventually roll off?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. I think that, that really affected the compares between 2015 and 2016. We had really big projects in 2015. They really kind of finished out in 2016, and we didn't see them ever flow through again in 2016. And I would tell you, they're probably not going to flow through in 2017. There are some out there, but they're not going to start till 2018. So what's built in here is really based on the highway program and conventional res and non-res growth, not the large energy projects.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And, John, in your prepared remarks, you said the price increases were well-received so far. Can you talk about the magnitude of the price increases in 2017 compared to the price increases that you put in at the start of 2016? And specifically, were you able to put in price increases into markets where volumes were down significantly in 2016?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Sure. I'll offer a couple comments, but I'll hand it out to Tom to kind of give you around the horn on what we're seeing in pricing, because it is really continued positive climate. First thing I'd say, Jerry, because it links into pricing is don't take our comments about back-half loaded as concerns about the underlying recovery at all. They're concerns if anything about timing, but you just heard Tom say, look, California and Texas are returning to growth for us. The rest of our franchise has been growing. Illinois should be flat, not at the same decline it had last year. So we're pretty excited about how we're set up for 2017. We're also just acknowledging a tough first quarter comp, and we're acknowledging the timing uncertainty we've seen with respect to large projects and when they actually take aggregate shipments. But, again, that's about timing, that's not about conviction in the recovery.","Now, you see that in pricing. The market participants see the demand. It's a big driver. The demand coming is a big driver of the pricing climate. The magnitude of the changes varies across markets. But in total for us, the way we look at it is the compounding margin improvements we've seen should continue and continue apace and consistent with the long-term goals we've laid out.","I will note in \u2013 sometimes get missed, but even in those markets that we had a lot of volume challenge last year, the Californias and Illinois as examples. We actually had quite healthy price increase. So it's not like all is bad in those markets, it's more of a temporary issue with respect to volumes. But let me hand it off to Tom to give maybe a better around the horn in what we're seeing in terms of the price increases we put in place so far.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, Jerry. With confidence in a long, gradual recovery ahead of us, the environment for price increases continues to be quite healthy. And it's driven obviously by improving demand, but also as we'll tell you, as we've always say, it's driven by the visibility that our customers have in the growing pipeline of work. We're seeing rising prices and\/or margin expansions across our footprint and across all product lines. As I look at the numbers without \u2013 I'm not going to get into naming markets, but I'll give you some examples of price increases that we implemented January 1, reading down the list, $1.25, $1.35, $0.50, $1.75, $0.60. Look, these are robust price increases and there just continues to be a lot of confidence in a long sustained recovery, and it's showing up in pricing.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm sorry, just to clarify. Even markets like California and Texas that were down in 2016, you are getting significant price increases to start off 2017?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","The answer to the question is, yes. In fact, we had price increases that were very, very healthy in those markets in 2016, and we'll continue to see price increases in 2017.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","One question, I guess is for John on the incrementals. I mean you gave us some good color on how to think about incrementals for the full year this year. And I understand that's the best way to look at the business overall. But you did also highlight the obvious tough comps we're facing here in the first quarter, not just you guys, but pretty much everybody is facing in the 1Q and how this year could be more back-end loaded. I get all that. But just for our modeling benefit, if we could get a little bit more color on how to think about the margins early in the year, especially given \u2013 coming off of a kind of a abnormal margin situation in 4Q and then you'll probably have kind of continued lack of fixed cost absorption in 1Q relative to other times in the year. Just any color, even if it's directionally on how to think about margins would be super helpful.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Trey, I'll try and give you some directional help, but you probably know what I'm going to say, which is we don't give quarterly guidance, and for a variety of reasons, particularly in a low-volume first quarter, let me just start by acknowledging that it's a little bit unpredictable. Okay?","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And I understand that.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So I'll try and give you help, but I just want to make sure we're clear about that. I mean, keep in mind that our business as it ramps up, we're running a business now that daily shipment rates, depending where you are in the year, can range from 700,000 to 900,000 tons. It only takes a couple days shifting from \u2013 in the end of March, as an example, to have an impact on first quarter incrementals. So I'd tell you to really focus on trailing 12-month trends, and not over-read the first quarter regardless \u2013 just like we said last year's first quarter, don't over-read the blow-out numbers.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Sure.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So all that said...","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","...nothing that we see. There is no boogeyman in the business that we see that would lead to a slower overall rate of margin improvement. So there's some timing differences quarter-to-quarter, but there is nothing major negative out there. If I think about some of the factors at play, you already mentioned some. But diesel throughout the year, we'll see how it plays out. Our assumptions for our guidance have diesel a little bit less than $2, so that's a small headwind for us next year.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","And what was the average for 2016? Sorry, just for...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Probably a $1.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","$1.60.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","$1.60.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Rising during the year and the fourth quarter diesel was a slight headwind, but not a major headwind. And the next big factor I'd point out is just the timing of price increases, and how they flow through the work. Again, the first quarter number can be a little bit deceptive that way. But it's really difficult \u2013 our big question in the first quarter really is probably more about volume than underlying margin structure of the business. Now, we get a lot of great operating leverage and a lot of great fixed cost leverage, so without that volume it impacts our incrementals. But this is mostly about timing of volumes as opposed to seeing major changes out there on the cost horizon if that makes any sense.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's super helpful. And the big wildcard obviously being volume in the 1Q, given the tough comp is \u2013 that was kind of the reason for the question, because I know it's not easy for you guys to call, and definitely not easy for us sitting in our chairs with the kind of unique 1Q we're facing.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Once again, I know this isn't that helpful to you and that's why, again, that's why we don't give quarterly guidance. But if you think about full year trends \u2013 that continued double-digit growth in unit margins is something we still feel good about.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, also mix played a role in 4Q \u2013 given the outlook you have for your different geographies and how they might perform, you mentioned seeing California and Texas returning to some growth there. But given that outlook and then also for your end markets, is there any kind of a mix impact, good or bad, negative or positive, I guess, that we should be thinking about as we go through 2017 and any assumptions you've laid out there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","It's Tom. I don't see a lot of mix impact in 2017, and if it were to come from the base side, we'd be very happy with it. And it would be in additive to the volumes that would be at the high side of the volume guidance. But I think we feel pretty good about how we've looked at it and we do those budgets from the \u2013 those projections from the ground up. So I don't see a lot of mix in those numbers, and again, if it were there, we'd be pleased with it because it'd be fines and base.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We're referring to healthier product mix which...","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Sure.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","....with \u2013 as you well know, Trey, with some of the new construction coming on, can put a little bit of downward pressure on reported average selling price, but if you look at real like-for-like pricing, that trend is still very positive.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. But you guys are reflecting that in the \u2013 in the range you gave?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We think we are in the 5% to 7%. Again, because our pricing decisions \u2013 you hear us say this all the time \u2013 are made so locally, I mean, some have been made well around this call. It can be a difficult number, but that's included in the range, the 5% to 7%. We don't see \u2013 I'm going to call it any deceleration in the pricing climate per se. We'll have mix effects across the business product and geographic, but the overall climate is \u2013 I mean, it's very consistent with last year.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. The climate is consistent. I think it continues to be healthy and it's not like you're getting price increases in asphalt rock but not in base. It's really across segments, and it's across product lines, and it's across the geographies.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. And last one from me, just to kind of touch on that $5 billion that you mentioned earlier, Tom. Just to be clear that I'm making sure I understand that. And that's your expectation for cumulative free cash flow, so net of CapEx, cumulative free cash flow through the years as we kind of progress towards that mid-cycle volume. And I think you pointed to in the past is something like 250 million tons. Is that the right way to think about that $5 billion?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Two parts to it, Trey. It's roughly a $3 billion of cumulative free cash flow.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","And $2 billion of incremental debt capacity.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","And think of that incremental debt capacity is 2 to 2.25 times mid-cycle EBITDA. They were then investment grade parameters.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Okay.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","A rough number, but not \u2013 your own modeling will probably come up with something not dissimilar.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Right. I think that's right.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","And now, we're not going to get way ahead of ourselves and spend that money before we make it in some kind of crazy way. But it is a \u2013 the business model throws off a lot of cash and you know that, but that's just \u2013 it's worth thinking about.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Sure. All right. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate you taking the question.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Trey.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. One is just a follow-up on pricing, as we have also seen pricing momentum improve, but I think just for the reminder for us on the call, could you go through your top five highest per unit priced markets? Because we know that there are some that have perhaps lagged on a volume basis, but it'd be helpful if you could just give us a reminder of those top five per unit priced markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, Kathryn, I think there is a little bit of a missed number here. Our top pricing markets are going to be, what we call remote markets. So, they're going to be on the coast where we ship products into them. And some of those may or may not be the top margin markets. Some are, some would lag some of those things. I think that \u2013 we'd tell you, it's such a local business, that's all going to be relative and the top pricing may not be the top margin. But I think the important here is that, we are seeing pretty good price increases consistent across all of our markets in all segments. I think that as those \u2013 as the projects kick in, particularly from the FAST Act and from the new state highway over 2017, 2018, and 2019, it will only continue to support price increases along with the private side, which just continues to grow.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Kathryn, if you look at it, just building on Tom's answer, and I think \u2013 well, you know this I know, but especially if you look with a two-year or three-year view, there's a pretty good overlap between further remaining growth in the recovery and generally speaking markets that are higher margin, at least, as we sit here today. Now, we'd tell you that for the markets that are on average lower margin we're working hard to move that up, but as the recovery unfolds, that should be little bit of a tailwind to us and that we have a lot of room to go in markets that are attractive on a margin perspective already.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Just want a little bit more color on your higher stripping costs that you noted in the press release. I assume this is \u2013 you're typically building in the winter for the build up in the peak of the construction season in the spring and summer. But is it correct to assume that the higher stripping cost in part is driven by higher backlogs and expected higher demand, particularly for certain key products such as clean stone?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, Kathryn, that's exactly correct. We are making hay while the sun's shining in that we \u2013 while we don't have those shipments and don't have \u2013 well, that fell off in the second half of December gives us an opportunity to go ahead and get some work done, so that we could bank reserves that were stripped for the season that we see coming in, in 2017 and wouldn't have to go outside and maybe pay higher prices for. So this is just prudent long-term operations management.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Kathryn, those higher stripping and repair and maintenance expenses, just to be clear for everybody, they're in the $0.22 increase in unit cost of sales that we talked about for the full year. The distortion just happens because they occurred in the fourth quarter when we happen to have lower volume.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah. Understood.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And you understand those economics plus our inventory economics.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah. Absolutely. One other subject I want to talk about is your non-resident market. I know there's been a lot of focus on public end market, but one of the things we're focusing on is a little bit more expansive definition of infrastructure under the new administration. Could you break out how much of your non-res end market is more heavy versus kind of your traditional or commercial kind of office type non-res projects? And if you have any view just with the change of administration on how your thoughts on traditional infrastructure versus that more expansive definition? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I'll take the first part of that. First is that, I think we've seen really healthy growth in the non-res sector in office, lodging, warehouses, distribution. And what's lagged some is manufacturing, institutional, and government. They actually declined somewhat over the year, but I think we are seeing some return in those. The fundamentals ultimately for non-res are in a good shape. You got population growth, you got employment growth. You know the external indicators are showing strength today and you've also got really healthy residential growth, which will pull non-res behind it. I think if you look \u2013 step back and look at our footprint of where we seeing substantial strength in non-res would be the Southeast, the Mid-Atlantic, Southern California, Arizona, Texas, excluding Houston and we think that's, well, actually may show some small growth in the year. But overall, I think we see healthy growth in the non-res segment.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Kathryn, just building on that and talking a little bit about \u2013 I'm not going to call it new administration and discussions. But we probably know one thing that you're very well aware of, which is we're already exceptionally well-positioned against a number of the increases and infrastructure funding that are already happening, particularly at a state and local level. And you know that well, but (52:55) of those increases that are already happening and we're very well positioned against those, whether that's improved maintenance or new road construction or port construction or water improvement or you name it, all those things we're well positioned against.","In terms of the broader definition of infrastructure and things like longer-term federal programs, one of the great things about aggregates focused business is we serve all those things. So we're absolutely fine and well positioned against a broader definition of infrastructure whether that's airports, intermodal facilities, typical transportation on and on and on and on, we're well positioned to serve substantially all of that increase in demand.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'd tell you that \u2013 I'd add to that, Kathryn, if that happens, as John said, we're in a great position for that and all of those projects will need our products. And I'd add to that, that \u2013 Vulcan Materials will be essential to building those critical infrastructure projects. I mean, that's what we do. And they don't really happen without us very well.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you. And final just handholding question of the $40 million EBITDA shortfall, how much of that is transitory versus any ongoing type issue? Thanks very much for answering my questions.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Kathryn, if you're referring to the quarter and what might be seen as a shortfall in gross profit margin percentage to that $40 million?","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Correct.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","If I would say that, substantially all of that is transitory or timing and that the right number to look at would be a $0.22 increase in unit cost of sales for the year and not the $0.89.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. A quick question. With all the \u2013 the $5 billion number you mentioned, Tom, it seemed like there was a lot of discussion around bolt-on sorts of acquisitions. Does that mean you're obviously fine with the footprint that's fantastic and you want to fill that in or are there larger acquisitions out there that you \u2013 that I didn't pick up on?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","We'd tell you both and those are \u2013 those, you just had to be optimistic at. When they come around, you will be on top of them. They will, I think over time you will see us do both, the ones that I think that are out there immediately. Right now we're bolt-on, but you'll see the new footprints and larger acquisitions over time. So, this is something we're excited about and we work hard on this all the time. The results although are going to be choppy and that's just a timing issue. I think, as we always talk about, the important piece here is the discipline, where do we have synergies, what's unique to us, what do we pay for them. And then once we get them, you got to go work hard and really fast to integrate them and make them make money.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And kind of turning back to the election, whether it's the lockbox in Illinois or the proposition there in California that you guys kind of mention. When do you think those can start having a meaningful impact on \u2013 well, strictly through the public piece, when can that start to flow through, those additional monies on the public side in the California market? And then, broader thoughts around the lockbox and the ability to help approve kind of the Illinois market?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think for the flow through, it's really \u2013 rule of thumb is always 18 months to 24 months now. You will see in some markets faster than that for repairs or overlays, and that just flows through past us. But by the time you collect the money, figure out which jobs you're going to do, engineer those jobs, let those jobs and they get started, it just takes that much time. And a perfect example of that is what we're going to see in the next few months in 2017 is that's how long it's taken for the FAST Act money and \u2013 states like Georgia, increases in Florida to flow through to shipments. But once they start, they start accelerating pretty fast. And so, the next two or three years or three or four years will be exciting to see the funds that we talked about two years ago flow through, these will just take a little time.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect, guys. Thank you and good luck.","Operator","Our next question will come from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. I just had a question on the acquisitions, the bolt-ons you made in the fourth quarter here, early in the first quarter. How much of that is embedded in your 2017 volume guidance? And as a follow-up to that, is there any meaningful EBITDA contribution that we should be thinking about as well?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll start, Garik. The acquisitions we announced, the total consideration for those is around $137 million. When it gets ramped up, those businesses in combination should do about $21 million in EBITDA on a kind of annual run rate basis. And obviously growing from there and there's some synergy upside beyond that. But I would assume, for your modeling, that all of that is in our guidance, particularly the EBITDA, just because we're in the process of closing some of these, bringing them on, ramping them up. And so, as we've thought about it, that is in the guidance. Likely gives us some volume upside later in the year, as we get these fully integrated into our platform, and we'll kind of communicate that as the year goes on. But, as Tom said, these are really good extensions of our existing franchise. And we hope to have more of these to talk about as the year goes on.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I think as we talked about earlier, this is a part of the discipline with acquisitions, and this is where the real work starts, that you got to integrate them fast and accurately and bring them up to speed as fast as we can. And we'll be working hard on that in 2017 to put them in the Vulcan family and get them performing with quality earnings as fast as we can.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So just to be clear, the 5% to 8% volume growth, we should assume that it does incorporate the acquisitions that you just made?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Just my second question is just on highway demand. You talked quite a bit about that today, but just wanted to drill in a little bit more, because it was a source of frustration in 2016, particularly from a timing standpoint. And now, we're on the federal side in continuing resolutions, some of the leading indicators on highway contract awards have been soft over the last several months. So just wanted to stress test the mid single-digit volume guidance that you have for highway demand in 2017. And any other color or any other leading indicators or any geographical indicators that you can provide us that gives you confidence in that figure versus the risk in 2017 that we could be facing a similar set of disappointing timing issues like we saw in 2016?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, if you think you were frustrated with timing and some of those in 2016, you could imagine how John and I were. But I think \u2013 we stress test that pretty hard. We've looked at this and really said, okay, do we know when it's going to start? And these are projects that \u2013 actually some of them have already started a little bit. I mean, we saw a few of these projects (1:00:58) \u2013 a few thousand tons in the fourth quarter of 2016. But I'm looking at four jobs in Atlanta right now that would have a total of about 3 million tons that we have \u2013 three out of the four have actually just started, just a little bit. And as soon as the construction season starts, those will start. I can think of three in Texas that would total over time probably over a couple \u2013 probably a couple of million tons or over 2 million tons, and those \u2013 actually those are being \u2013 just let or being let, and we know that they'll start in the second and third quarter. So I think we have a lot more visibility and confidence that these jobs are ready to go. We've already shipped a little bit on them, and we're \u2013 as I said earlier, we're really \u2013 the timing here is not what year is it going to ship in, it's when does construction season start?","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thanks. Just the last question, I might have missed it, but didn't hear much discussion on share buybacks. As it relates to the $5 billion of available capital over the next several years, shares here down a little bit today \u2013 relative underperformers, I guess since the election compared to some of the peers. How are you balancing the view of the share price with your free cash flow versus the M&A opportunities that you talked about today?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Garik, it's John. I think no change, so \u2013 as we discussed, we work through all of our capital allocation priorities. We'll be opportunistic in how we think about share repurchases. No commitment to buy any certain amount at a certain period of time. We'll report on it after the fact. But that said, as this recovery cycle moves forward, we should have the opportunity to balance both reinvestment in the core franchise, investment in growth, both M&A and internal investment for growth, and return on capital to shareholders via mix of dividend and share repurchase. For us, it's about balancing those things given our outlook for things like M&A activity. We did not buy any shares back in the fourth quarter. You kind of saw some M&A activity that we reported on, but no real change. So I would expect through the cycle, you're going to see that investment capacity deployed to good use, and that'll be some mix of growth oriented and returning to shareholders.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rohit Seth with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the BOLD Act. And I know there's been some developments within the industry to create a successor bill to the FAST Act and there could be some overlap in the timing of when that would kick in, if it does develop as intended. Are you guys seeing any developments there? Is that something you guys are working with the trade group on? And if you have any color on that and what that impact would be on the business, that'd be great.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. The folks who worked on the BOLD Act did an outstanding job with that. It is a great idea. I think as you know right know, there's a lot of positive discussions in D.C. about infrastructure with a lot of people working really hard on solutions to funding infrastructure, which our company desperately needs and we obviously support. How that happens, we don't know yet. There's just a lot of uncertainty to it. We think it's a matter of when, not if. And when it happens, there's nobody better positioned to serve these projects than we are. It's what we do. It's who we are. It's how we started. But I think that overall, if you step back and look at this also, without any of that flowing through, you've got some very healthy highway projects coming in the next three years with increased funding from the FAST Act and from state funding, which is only increasing.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. And then just in the first quarter, can you comment on weather trends that you've seen thus far? Is it in a headwind or a tailwind?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think probably about neutral, with the exception of \u2013 probably a little bit of a headwind. I mean, California was very, very wet, as you well know. But with just two more months of this left and we'll just wait and see and we just don't know. Remember that 2016 was really, really good weather. But our markets look good and the work is there. So, whatever happens with the weather, the work is not going away and we'll ship it when the sun comes out.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Keep in mind that in the first quarter shipments typically accelerate through the quarter as we get more into the construction season. So I wouldn't read too much into January anyway.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And can you comment on some of the bidding activity you're seeing out there in the Southeast and in California, Texas?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. It continues to pick up both in \u2013 particularly in residential, non-residential and highway. The Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic states continue to be very, very good. We've seen Virginia pick up a little bit actually which was \u2013 it was a little bit flat last year and we're seeing it pick up. So, that is very encouraging for us. We spoke to California and Texas, both of those, particularly \u2013 both of those are healthy. Texas is, I guess, what I'd say, remains healthy and both public and private bid activity is very healthy. On the non-res side in California, I think and the res side where we continue to see it pick up and private \u2013 the private construction segment is what will drive growth in California this year.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.","Oh, great. Thanks. You referenced tight construction resources in the U.S. I'm just curious how pervasive that is? And then, thinking about 2017 as a whole, is that something that could push you towards the low end of the volume guidance but maybe the high end of the pricing guidance?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think it depends on the market and when we say it's short, it's really, do they have the crews, do they have the lay down machines, do they have enough ready mix trucks and it's \u2013 it's different in every market. But I think that as you see the bidding work pick up, as the pipelines comes through the starts, that capacity will grow along with it. I think that those \u2013 that is always a healthy piece of pricing, but it is a piece of it. So it creates a healthy environment for pricing or one of things it does, but it's not the only one.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And rather than commenting just on 2017, it is a factor that's at play when we say a longer recovery could and maybe should be a more profitable recovery. But I don't \u2013 the dynamics are such that I wouldn't read too much just into 2017 on that just yet. And also to keep in mind, when we say capacity just to be clear that this really isn't our capacity. This is end-to-end construction sector. Our assets, as we sit here today, from an aggregates point of view have \u2013 they've in a single year produced more than 305 million tons of shipments. So this isn't a capacity issue for us. This is a end-to-end construction sector set of factors.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask quickly on the acquisitions you've done past four or five months. Are those all pure aggregates or are they vertically integrated? And then what's your thought on making vertically integrated acquisitions?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, I think as we \u2013 as some of those are aggregates, some are asphalt, some are both. And I think that as always \u2013 in our foot print, it's really not so much about vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, it's about markets and how we view the market and how we better serve the market. So as we go forward \u2013 our strategy is always to be, as we say, grounded in aggregates. That's really \u2013 that's our bread and butter and that's what we do. But we will be \u2013 we will look at acquisitions that are vertically integrated, if they fit that whole strategy and if they fit that market.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Typically, we use the word downstream or more specifically asphalt or concrete \u2013 vertically integrated is really how we're actually approaching it.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hey, Timna. Good morning.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, afternoon. So I'll just leave it to one question, we had a lot of discussion. But I mean, on a high level, we're just wondering and kind of surprised by the pricing guidance because if you look at the 7% that you achieved overall on a high level in 2016 and the guidance of 5% to 7%, that implies that there could be a downside to the momentum in pricing. And when you match that against the potential cost pressures that you've highlighted, whether they be from some of the constraints in getting labor (1:10:00) supply in the industry or diesel, that seem to us then a little bit low. So I was just wondering, is this a conservative guide? Are you trying to be \u2013 you usually have a pretty good track record in forecasting prices, so we're just wondering if there was another dynamic that we're missing?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I don't think there's any other dynamic. I don't think we have anything built in there for big diesel increases and if we did, we'd be fine with that because over time, they help support pricing and help support margin improvements. I think we feel confident in our pricing guidance. Obviously, we're going to work hard every day to better serve our customers and make our products and our services more valuable. I think at this point, we feel pretty confident in our guidance.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So to clarify then, if you do see higher diesel costs or higher labor costs or other costs, could we see that number increase accordingly?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","First of all, yeah, cost will drive \u2013 it will help drive price. It's one of the dynamics that's always there, but from a diesel perspective sometimes it lags a little bit, but it always flows through. From a cost perspective, I think you really got to step back and look at the trend of cost in 2016, which I'd tell you, from a cost perspective over 12 months of \u2013 with very little production increases of only $0.22 and 3%, that's a pretty good trend and I like hearing that into 2017 along with the pricing momentum. So I think at this point \u2013 things will change through the year, but \u2013 and we'll adjust accordingly. But at this point, I think we're pretty confident in our guidance.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Timna, I'd add, since you asked the question this way, about cost and price. We talk about this a lot and I know you know this. We run the business on margin and cash and that's a function of pricing, it's a function of product mix and production efficiency, it's a function of our operating efficiencies and how all those things work together, not just average selling prices. So, I think if you work through the guidance, you're going to see, an implied another year of very healthy unit margin improvement and at a rate faster than pricing at the moment would dictate. So I think, reading any deceleration into margin is certainly not what we see at the moment.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Appreciate it.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. As we look forward to the 2017, so I would coin it as, we're set up well for 2017. Our long-term cost trends are very good. Our markets are showing growth. And our pricing shows the confidence of us and our customers and the whole market in that long-term growth.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials Company 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Don James, Chairman and CEO, please go ahead.","Donald M. James","Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today on the call are John McPherson, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who most recently served as our Senior Vice President for our East region; and Tom Hill, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who most recently was Senior Vice President of our South region.","We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference throughout the call. These slides are also available to you on the webcast.","Moving to Slide 2. Let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports and in our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during the call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's fourth quarter 2013 earnings release.","Turning now to Slide 3. We will begin with a brief discussion of highlights from the fourth quarter before we review the full year.","Our fourth quarter results demonstrate excellent growth potential of our markets and the meaningful operating leverage that exists in our aggregates business. Aggregates volumes increased 7% in the quarter, and we leveraged those incremental tons of aggregates into significantly higher earnings.","As you can see on this slide, a 14% increase in net sales led to a 48% increase in gross profit. Earnings from continuing operations increased from $0.03 per diluted share to $0.08 per share for the quarter. These earnings improvement were driven by expanding margins in aggregates, earnings improvements in our non-aggregate segments and lower SAG costs.","On Slide 4, you can see that each of our segments reported higher shipments for the quarter as private construction activity continues to increase in the markets we serve. Aggregate shipments increased 7%. Volumes in Arizona, Georgia and California were particularly strong, up 34%, 29% and 22%, respectively. Texas, Florida and North Carolina all reported double-digit volume growth as well. These improvements continue the success we saw in the third quarter and support our forecast early last year that volume improvements would accelerate in the second half of the year as the construction recovery began.","Our ready-mixed volumes were up 15% for the quarter. Asphalt shipments were also up 12%. Higher shipments drove the earnings improvement in each segment of our business, especially the aggregates business, where our operating leverage is significant. The aggregates segment gross profit of $112 million was up $30 million or 37% from the prior year.","Taking a closer look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 5, you see that aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 3.5% and shipments were up 2.3 million tons, or 7%, leading to a 14% increase in segment revenues. This top line growth, along with very good unit production costs, led to a 390 basis point increase in the aggregates segment gross profit margin.","Cash gross profit increased $0.48 per ton or 12%. The fourth quarter, with higher volumes, higher prices and flat aggregates segment cost, continued the strong result we experienced in the third quarter of 2013.","And moving now to the full year results on Slide 6. EPS from continuing operations were $0.16 per diluted share and earnings improvement of $0.58 per share for the prior year. We believe this improved performance sets the stage for the beginning of earnings growth going forward. A 9% increase in net sales for the year led to a 28% increase in gross profit as each segment reported improved earnings.","Full year aggregates segment gross profit increased $61 million, and margins expanded 140 basis points due to a 3% increase in both volume and price. We leverage this increased sales by holding our SAG costs flat with the prior year, leading to a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA.","Our cash earnings reached $292 million, up $82 million,, or 39%, over 2012. Our expectations for 2013 to be the first year of aggregates volume growth since 2005 were met. Further, the expectation that volume growth would be weighted towards the second half of the year also materialized.","Wrapping up my comments regarding full year 2013, let me highlight the progress we have made to strengthen the balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. In 2013, we reduced long-term debt by approximately $150 million and ended the year with cash and equivalent balance of about $198 million. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was reduced from 5.8x at the end of 2012 to 5x at the end of 2013. The downward trend in this measurement is a priority for us as we continue our efforts to move to an investment-grade credit rating.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Hill, who will provide some commentary around the contrast of the first half of 2013 with the second half.","James Thomas Hill","Thank you, Don.","Turning to Slide 7. You can see that the first half and second half of the year were markedly different, as Don just mentioned. Volumes and resulting earnings were overweighted to the second half of the year due to improving private construction activity and the impacts of weather.","In the first half of the year, volumes were slightly lower than prior year due mostly to the sharp contrast in weather for the comparable halves. In 2012, many of our markets experienced an extremely mild winter, while in 2013, wet weather dampened shipping levels in key shipping months. As a result, first half volumes in 2013 were down 1% versus prior year.","Consistent with our expectations for the second half of 2013, aggregates demand improved to due to increased construction activity, including some large project work that began to ship as expected without the adverse weather impacts. Additionally, shipments that were delayed in the first half of the year due to weather began to ship in the second half.","As a result, volumes in the second half increased 8%, driving a $55 million or 27% increase in gross profit. Aggregates gross profit for the year were up $61 million, 86% of which occurred in the second half, demonstrating the operating leverage that results from higher volumes.","Turning to Slide 8. You can see an upward trend in the aggregates cash gross profit per ton, an important measure of our performance. Full year cash gross profit per ton in 2013 was $4.36. This is the highest in 4 years. It is important to note that current unit profitability is 30% higher than it was in 2005, which was Vulcan's peak volume year. This higher unit profitability sets the stage for better earnings leverage and provides the foundation for our continued optimism for significant earnings growth in this construction cycle.","Our opportunities to improve our operations leverage have come from the acquisition of aggregates operations and reserves in high-growth markets, like the ones Don mentioned earlier. Additionally, the sale of our Florida area, concrete and cement assets to Cementos Argos, announced in January, will provide immediate improvement to profitability and earnings and allow us to pursue additional aggregates investment opportunities.","On Slide 9, we summarize this transaction, the strategic rationale and the use of proceeds. After touching on the strategic rationale of this transaction, I'm going to turn the prepared remarks over to John MacPherson for some comments on the financials and use of proceeds.","Touching first on the transaction. We have agreed to sell our Florida cement and concrete operations to Argos for $720 million. From a strategic viewpoint, this transaction is consistent with our aggregates-focused strategy, and we will remain in the Florida market as a leading producer of construction aggregates.","The transaction includes a 20-year aggregates supply agreement, which keeps us well positioned to participate in the Florida recovery. Vulcan and Argos are strategic partners in other parts of the country, and we believe our aggregates-focused strategy complements the cement and concrete focus of Argos. We look forward to furthering that relationship by supplying these operations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John MacPherson.","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Tom. As Tom mentioned, the sales price of these assets was $720 million. The sales price will result in a pretax gain of approximately $210 million and a net impact on earnings per diluted share of approximately $1. After-tax proceeds should be approximately $685 million after the use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and the tax benefits of acquiring other property through a 1031 like-kind exchange.","As noted when we announced the transaction, we're deploying these proceeds primarily to pay down debt. On an after-tax basis, we used approximately $550 million to repurchase $500 million par value in bonds. We also acquired a quarry with 136 million tons of reserves in Southern California in a $117 million transaction that closed on December 31.","As I'll note in more detail in a subsequent slide, our credit metrics have improved significantly, and we believe we're well positioned to add high-quality assets to our portfolio as opportunities arise.","Moving to Slide 10, and in order to give you a clear view of the impact the divestitures and debt repurchase may have on our nearer-term earnings, we have included summary information from a table that will be included in a Form 8-K filing upon closing of the transaction with Argos.","The information reflects the company's full year 2013 operating results, assuming both sale of the Florida cement and concrete operations and the repurchase of $500 million in bonds have been completed on January 1, 2013. In other words, you can see what the impact would have been on the fiscal year '13 results we reported today had these transactions taken place at the beginning of last year.","As you can see, the divested assets contribute approximately $173 million in net sales during 2013. Had the divestiture occurred on January 1, 2013, Vulcan's net sales would have been $2.46 billion as compared to $2.63 billion reported today, or approximately 7% lower. Although sales have been lower, gross profit would have been higher, $449 million as compared to the $427 million reported today. The gross profit contribution of the divested assets, although certainly improving with growing volumes in Florida, remain negative in 2013.","The pro forma impact on our gross profit margin as a percent of sales is a 210 basis points improvement to 18.3%. Interest expense, given the use of proceeds to pay down debt, would have been $33 million lower.","Netting these effects on an after-tax basis, 2013 earnings per fully diluted share would have been $0.48 as opposed to the $0.16 we reported today. I'll touch on the impact of these transactions and the impact they will have on our credit metrics in a moment. But before doing so, I'd like to take us back to the goals we laid out 2 years ago.","Slide 11 draws directly from our February 2012 earnings commentary. The top of the slide notes the commitments we made at that time to improve our profitability, divest nonstrategic assets and reduce debt and leverage.","Following the close of the divestitures and debt tender announced in January 23, which we expect to happen in the first quarter, we will have accomplished the goals we communicated to you 2 years ago. With respect to profit enhancement, we have increased adjusted EBITDA by $116 million and adjusted EBIT by $173 million over the past 2 years.","In our core aggregates segment, gross profit has increased 410 basis points, or $107 million despite tons shipped growing only 2%. And as noted earlier, our cash margin per ton sold has improved steadily during this period.","Now of course, our commitment to delivering on the full profit potential of our aggregates business remains unchanged. We expect margins to improve further in 2014 as volumes continue to recover, and the profit enhancement initiatives implemented over the past 2 years will continue to benefit our business for some time to come.","With respect to planned asset sales, we committed to generate $500 million in proceeds from the disciplined sale of nonstrategic assets. Following the close of our transaction with Argos, we will have generated over $1 billion from such divestitures. At the same time, we've reinvested approximately $240 million to purchase aggregates operations and reserves in key markets, such as California, Georgia, Texas and Virginia.","Through the process of these divestitures and acquisitions, we believe we strengthened our core aggregates portfolio and improved our prospective returns on capital now and through the cycle.","And finally, from a capital structure perspective, we have reduced debt by approximately $800 million and improved our credit metrics substantially, giving us greater flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders as we move forward.","Slide 12 gives a bit more information regarding our improved profitability, lower debt balances and resulting stronger credit metrics. The debt figures here for 2013 include the impact of our outstanding $500 million tender, which we compare to our adjusted 2013 EBITDA in order to illustrate the degree to which our credit position will have improved over the past 2 years.","Following the close of our debt tender, we expect our ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be in the order of 3.6x, down from 7.6x in 2011. As Don indicated, our intent remains to return to investment-grade credit ratings, and we're well positioned to accomplish that goal as demand recovers. In the meantime, we have the flexibility needed to invest in our operations and add to our portfolio as opportunities arise.","Before I hand it off to Don to discuss our outlook for 2014 in more detail, let me once again complement and thank our people. What we have been able to accomplish over the past 2 years and the excitement we have regarding the strength of our position moving forward serve as a direct compliment to the quality of Vulcan's people at all levels of our organization. Their expertise, dedication and drive will be only more valuable as we prepare for the growth ahead of us. We are proud of what we've done so far, and we're genuinely excited about the opportunities to come.","Don, over to you.","Donald M. James","Thanks, John. As John mentioned, we realized a sharp increase in aggregates shipments in the second half of 2013. One of the drivers of this increase is the continued recovery in private construction activity.","If you'll turn to Slide 13, you can see the -- we expect each major end market for aggregates demand to increase in 2014, led by strong growth from private construction activity. This is certainly good news.","Even better, we expect growth in Vulcan's served markets to outperform the rest of the U.S. This belief that our markets will achieve above-average growth fuels the excitement John mentioned earlier. Our market position in these higher-growth markets, coupled with the earnings leverage we have improved upon during the downturn, is a powerful combination to grow earnings.","Private construction activity is expected to account for most of the demand growth in 2014. Additionally, we expect large projects, including both public infrastructure and private industrial projects, to play an important role in overall demand growth in 2014.","Moving to Slide 14. You will see how this end market outlook translates into volume and price growth for Vulcan. We expect volumes to increase 4% to 7% from the prior year and for growth to occur across most of our markets. This volume growth is expected to provide positive momentum for broad-based price improvement, with the timing and rate of price increase varying across our markets.","We expect sales growth and earnings improvement from our non-aggregates businesses, while SAG costs for the full year expected to be in line with 2013.","Interest expense should be $165 million to $170 million, down sharply from 2013 due to the anticipated closing of our announced tender offer for $500 million in long-term debt and the repayment of $150 million in debt during 2013.","Our DD&A for 2014 should be approximately $275 million, assuming the sale of our Florida concrete and cement businesses closing in the first quarter.","Finally, we anticipate capital spending of approximately $220 million. This increase in capital spending will support the growth in aggregates volume we see in 2014 and beyond and further improve our production cost and operating efficiencies.","In closing, let me say that we like our position today as a leading aggregate supplier in the United States. We like our markets, and we like our positions within those markets. We have been working hard over the past 2 years to complete our announced initiatives, and we have achieved our goals.","We will remain committed to continuing improvement in our operating results and in creating additional value for our shareholders.","Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ted Grace with SIG.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just start by talking about now that we've got the balance sheet kind of more where you want it -- I know you mentioned the investment-grade rating was the goal, but it certainly provide you with a lot more flexibility to kind of go on offense. And so I was just wondering if I could walk through how you're thinking about redeploying that kind of new capital to kind of accept to grow the business more aggressively with the cycle?","Donald M. James","Ted, our strategy remains consistent. We want to grow our aggregates business in high-growth metropolitan markets. We have opportunities, we believe, to do that in 2014, and that's where our focus will be.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And maybe could you just elaborate on how the acquisition environment feels and what the -- kind of the prospects for deals looks like?","Donald M. James","We believe there are significant opportunities to help us pursue the strategy of adding aggregate operations in some of our best markets. And we are looking at those and working on some opportunities that we hope will materialize in 2014.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the second thing I just wanted to ask is in terms of -- think about the CapEx dollars to increase to $220 million, can you walk through kind of where you see yourself spending that between the aggregate business and the asphalt and concrete business, how we should think about growth versus maintenance CapEx? And maybe geographically, if there's any color on -- part of that can go to the extent in this load to increase capacity there. Or any handle there in that regard will be great as well.","Donald M. James","Ted, there's both maintenance CapEx and growth CapEx in that $220 million. We will replace some mobile equipment. As we've said before, our maintenance CapEx is really a function over time of the throughput of volume. And as we're looking at higher volumes in 2014 and certainly beyond, we all -- we have a very good plan, which Tom Hill and Danny Shepherd have worked through. The vast majority of the CapEx will go into our aggregates business. But there'll also be some CapEx, in particular, going into our ready-mixed business in the Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C. area, which is a really good business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","We have been noting throughout this year the improvements in markets in the Eastern part of the U.S., which previously had lagged. Could you give a little bit more color on the pace of improvement and in particular, up there, any margin differentials between performance in the Eastern part of the U.S. versus the Western?","Donald M. James","Well, certainly our markets in the Eastern U.S. were impacted in the first half. They came back very strongly in the second half. We do get very nice margins in the East, but we also get some really nice margins in the West. So we don't have a big diversity between our margins in the East and the West. Certainly, our margins in California are improving. Our margins in Texas are improving. Our margins in Arizona are improving. So we're seeing improvement in our margins across our footprint.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And is the margin improvement more a function of just better volumes? Or is there something structural in consolidation that's helping the margin improvement?","Donald M. James","I believe margin improvement is coming from price and price discipline. It's coming from operating cost, and it's coming from volume improvement. Whereas we indicated some of our highest growth markets are in the West: Arizona, California, Texas; and where, as we've said, I think, repeatedly, we have huge volume leverage in the aggregates business, which really helps to drive earnings with relatively modest volume growth.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, great. Moving just to end markets and focusing in -- more on the non res and the commercial demand, could you give a little bit more color what types of projects you're seeing? We are definitely seeing more industrial-focused type commercial projects, so plants, port work. But if you could give a little bit more color on the type of non res or commercial projects you're seeing now and if you contrast that with what you'd seen in prior cycles.","Donald M. James","I think -- and I'll ask Tom Hill to comment on this in a minute, but there are 2 pieces, we're projecting in our markets about a 9% growth in private non res. There are 2 components to that. There is the traditional private non res growth, that's retail office, hotels; and we're seeing that in a number of markets. But I think along the Gulf Coast, there are some very significant industrial projects, many of which are tied to the new energy opportunity and how that is creating a boom in those markets, plus aircraft manufacturing and automobile manufacturing in some of our footprints. And, Tom, let me ask you to comment further.","James Thomas Hill","Thanks, Don. We are seeing a number of industrial projects along the Gulf Coast, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, tied to energy. We've started shipping a number of those late 2013, and we'll -- that will pick up in 2014. We're also seeing some port expansion projects. And this is in addition to the -- as Don said, the traditional nonresidential that follows the improvement in residential growth.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And I assume the port expansion is tied to Panama Canal and prep for that eventual opening.","Donald M. James","Yes, that's correct.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. Final question, and this may be in your filings, but what portion of the ready-mixed concrete loss in the quarter was attributable to the Florida assets versus the other geographies that will stay within Vulcan?","John R. McPherson","Kathryn, it's John. I think we'll discuss more on that as we close the transaction and move forward. But certainly, the concrete assets we have retained are more profitable than the ones we've divested. And I think absent the divested assets, that would -- the divested assets would be the majority of the loss.","Operator","And your next question comes from Todd Vencil with Stern Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","This is probably an obvious question, but I will ask it anyway. If I take your very helpful reconciliation, walking through the impact of the divestiture and I just blow out the amount of that in cement, is the rest of the adjustment all in the concrete segment?","Donald M. James","Yes.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess my main question is as you look at your forecast, Don, where do you see sort of upside or downside risk? And what will drive that for this year to the ranges you have given?","Donald M. James","I believe there's upside, Todd, in the industrial and energy-related projects that Tom Hill referenced. There's also upside in the timing of some of the TIFIA projects, which you are familiar with. If some of those get kicked off in a significant way toward the second half of 2014, that's an upside. If we get a new highway bill on time, that could have a marginal impact in 2014. But most of the work on -- that we will get on highways is already based on the existing highway bill and the bid lettings that already occurred and will occur in the first part of 2014. So the big upside is in industrial construction, primarily on the Gulf Coast, and the big TIFIA projects. And there are big TIFIA projects in our footprint, some of which we have booked, some of which we are working to book in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Florida, California.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And since you brought it up, what are you hearing from your better purchase than the one I have about what the outlook or the state of affairs is with regard to the highway bill?","Donald M. James","At this point, Todd, we don't see an interruption in highway funding. The mechanism for how that will be achieved, whether it is a reauthorization of the highway bill on October 1, '14, or an extension or funding extension, our belief based on our contacts in Washington is that particularly in an election year, there's unlikely to be any disruption in the flow of federal dollars to the state DOTs.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Makes sense to me. And the final question, I guess, just to follow up on that. On TIFIA, I mean, do you -- I would think it would be a no-brainer to sort of whatever they do with highways to continue funding TIFIA at the higher level that was baked in the last highway bill. Is that consistent with what you're hearing, or is there something else going on?","Donald M. James","Yes. And the rationale is that there are far more TIFIA projects that have been submitted than can be funded under the current MAP-21 TIFIA authorization. It is a very deficit-friendly way to fund highway congestion -- or highway construction in high-growth metropolitan markets. TIFIA, as you know, requires a revenue stream to fund the repayment of the treasury lending. And as a result of that, you have to be in high-growth congested markets in order to generate enough revenue to meet the TIFIA financing requirements. So these projects get built in our sweet spots, and we really like TIFIA. And we think it is probably the easiest part of the new highway bill to get reauthorized.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Matt Rybak on the call for Jerry. Can you just first talk about how much of the volume momentum from the second half of this past year you've seen flowing to the first month of 2014? And then maybe discuss a little bit how you're thinking about the seasonality of shipments in 2014, whether you think they'll again be back-half weighted or be a little bit more smooth.","Donald M. James","You can't draw any conclusion from January shipments, so I won't do that. And we'll report on that at the end of the first quarter. We certainly think that there is a lot of momentum going into 2014 from the second half of 2013, primarily in private construction, both residential and non res. We've talked about upside. If there is -- if there are -- if any of these industrial projects get moving in a big way or the TIFIA projects get moving in a big way, we could see stronger second half shipments than first half. But we'll have to wait and see how those things, the timing of those projects come along, and we'll keep you updated on that in further conference calls.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are you seeing any significant headwind on the Panama Canal project given the stall of activity that's currently taking place down there?","Donald M. James","I think the U.S. port expansions are way behind the completion of the Panama Canal. So even though the canal construction has been extended by maybe a year or so, the ports along the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic Coast have a lot of catching up to do to be ready by the time the canal is completed. So I don't believe there's any -- going to be any slowdown in the work being done in the U.S. ports.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just turning to the public side briefly, can you talk maybe a little bit about how your large public construction project backlog today compares to levels a year ago, and possibly quantify the value of projects you're currently bidding on?","Donald M. James","Our public projects, particularly highway projects, are -- we have a higher backlog today than we had a year ago. To give a little color on that, we'll start our shipping the I-90 job in Chicago. We'll start shipping Virginia midtown tunnel. We've got -- we're seeing the I-75\/575 job in Atlanta. And we just started shipping the Grand Parkway, the third loop around Houston. So we're seeing the large highway jobs pick up in '14.","Operator","Your next question comes with Chris Olin with Cleveland.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to go back a little bit to the Panama Canal and port situation. Do you have any type of thoughts on how much aggregates don't -- could be consumed per port? Or is there any way to quantify what the impact could be on the industry?","Donald M. James","I think it is too early in most cases to try to quantify that. It all depends on the port design. And so we don't have estimates that we would be prepared to share publicly at this time.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Fair enough. Could you give us a bit of an update on the quarry in Mexico, maybe where it's at from a utilization point of view? And any updated thoughts you might have on expanding the production capacity there?","Donald M. James","Yes, let me ask Tom Hill to respond to that.","James Thomas Hill","We still have ample capacity at the quarry in Mexico. But if we approach capacity there, we are prepared and ready to expand that operation fairly quickly. We've looked at that and are comfortable with being able to expand that, if necessary, in a timely manner.","Donald M. James","We have a very large reserve base there. We have plenty of capacity in our harbor for incremental aggregates shipments. The plant can be expanded efficiently from a capital standpoint, and we look forward to being sold out because we're -- we've got tremendous opportunity coming out of that operation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The first one was -- going back to the highway bill for a second, if you think about the multiyear outlook and trying to grow your aggregates business back to any kind of resemblance of prior peak volume, how important is it do you think to get a multiyear bill like with the previous ones where you have successive increases in spending? I'm just trying to think about the outlook, and it seems that you're getting more positive on nonresidential. Obviously, residential has been improving. It seems like the infrastructure is the -- is slowing the growth of potential a bit. So I was just trying to think about the multiyear situation, what the potential is for volume growth.","Donald M. James","As we indicated in the prepared remarks, our outlook for 2014 is the first time since 2005 that all 4 of our major end markets are projected to grow in terms of aggregate demand. The big growth, obviously, as we pointed out and is contained in our slides, is in -- on the private side, other non-highway infrastructure we're projecting up 3% in our markets and highways up 2% in our markets. So clearly, highways are lagging for 2014. Again, the timing of TIFIA projects could change that. The issue with the Federal Highway Program is, of course, funding. We are seeing, though, a lot of states making moves to pick up their own revenue streams. In particular, Virginia and Maryland have an active state revenue enhancements that will significantly advance highway funding. But if we get -- if -- and our projection for highway shipments in 2014 is largely based on what's already in the pipeline. But if we do -- if we are able to work with our coalitions and Congress and achieve some improvement in the Federal Highway Program, then I think there's a lot of upside there. But at this point, we are projecting only 2% growth in our markets.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And can you remind us what highways are right now kind of in 2013 as a percentage of your overall mix?","Donald M. James","Oh, about 30% to 35%.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question was the SAG guidance that you gave for flat, does that take into account the divestiture of the cement assets? Because it looks like you had $9 million plus of SAG in that segment.","Donald M. James","It has that segment in our SAG through the first quarter.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that means other -- so just other spending is just going to be up. Normal spending course of business is going to be up by $9 million.","Donald M. James","Well, as we continue to grow our aggregates business, both internally and through acquisition, that will push our SAG up modestly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is Seth in for Keith Hughes. I just want to ask a question on the concrete business. I'm trying to get a feel for post the divestiture. How should we think about the margins and the volume in this business going forward?","John R. McPherson","Yes. Again, I think I answered before, I think we'll give more detail on this after we've closed the transaction and move forward. I would again reiterate that most of the loss reported last year was associated with the divested assets, and the margin structure of what we retained is significantly higher than what we divested. Again, we'll give you more details as we move forward.","Operator","And your last question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A quick question you, Don, how quickly can something get into the pipeline and you all start shipping rocks? Is that something that you know -- something in the pipeline that would happen next year, and we're kind of kicking that came down the road? Or is that all of a sudden, we could have kind of a -- I don't want to say influx but things being more expedited? How likely is that?","Donald M. James","It all depends on the end market and more -- even within the end market, it all depends on the nature of the project. For example, in highway construction, if there is an overlay project that is a resurfacing project that's bid in February, it can ship in May or June. If it is a project that requires right away acquisition and dirt-moving, the shipments can be delayed by 12, 18 months or more. Housing is relatively quick. As you know, the impact on our demand from housing starts is largely in the infrastructure streets and utilities as opposed to the construction of the house. One exception being in most of Florida, building codes require houses to be built out of masonry, which has aggregate in it. And there's a little more flow-through into residential there. Multifamily residential has higher aggregate content, and those move pretty quickly. I think once the TIFIA projects are finally approved, since they are financed and have to get to a revenue stream, there is an incentive for the contractors to get those projects built faster, which is an incentive that's not typically available in regular highway projects. So -- and certainly with the industrial and energy projects, which are private, once those projects are approved and construction starts, there's all of the incentive in the world to get those projects finished quickly. So the lead times are very different, and we tend to look at things as a big pipeline and projects feed in. And so it's -- the mix of products in that pipeline are often very difficult to say with some precision as to how long between contract award and material shipments. I'm sorry I can't give you any more precise answer, but it's a very flexible result depending on the nature of the project.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","No, no, no, that's great. In the release, there is a line about unlocking capital for more productive usage. So should we think about that continued debt pay-down, then some M&A? And then are we starting to think about a dividend at some point this year? Or is that still kind of to be determined?","Donald M. James","I think our board will consider a dividend each board meeting as we do. And certainly, that's one of the opportunities we have. And we've said many times before, we look forward to getting to the point where we can begin to restore a meaningful dividend. And I think we are -- hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to do that sooner rather than later. I'll ask John to respond further to the other parts of your question.","John R. McPherson","I think, I mean, use the capital, what parts you're referring to investing more capital on our core aggregates business over time where we enjoy great fundamentals, great returns, great operating leverage moving forward. And you've seen us do that. We've taken some of the capital from these divestitures to both pay down debt, yes; but also to give us the flexibility to make some investments using this make in our core aggregates markets, which are very attractive.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, no doubt. And then as far as the...","Donald M. James","The next significant debt repayment is at the end of 2015, and we would expect to be able to repay that out of just operating cash flows.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And as far as the M&A environment, it's been pretty active out there. Have the multiples -- are they starting to creep up as well? And would you look at buying assets or more swaps? Or how do you all think about that as you tighten up the shares within your respective markets?","Donald M. James","Well, if we can do bolt-on acquisitions in our high-growth markets, we are very interested in those kind of transactions. We get significant synergy primarily from operating cost and overhead, and that will be -- our principal focus is aggregate bolt-on acquisitions in high-growth markets. If we have assets that may be more valuable to someone else than they are to us, then we would certainly consider a swap as necessary. But our primary focus is on bolt-on aggregate acquisitions in our key markets.","Operator","There are no further audio questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald M. James","Well, thank you very much for joining us today. Obviously, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter and the second half of 2013, and we very much look forward to 2014. And we will talk to you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you so much, and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Lena, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark Warren - Vulcan Materials Company","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, let me call you attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access the presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. Rather than review each slide specifically during our call today, we will provide the key highlights in our prepared remarks in order to allow more time for your questions.","Before we begin, let me remain you that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you, Mark, and we appreciate your joining us for the call today. So let's get right to the key points. In spite of aggregate shipments in the quarter being hit hard by a rough weather across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, and by specific circumstances in Illinois and Coastal Texas, our unit margins in Aggregates reached a second-quarter record, and the pricing climate remains positive. In addition, our visibility to a turn in public construction activity continued to improve. There are more highway project tons in backlog than we've seen in at least three years.","Private non-residential starts in our markets are now growing. They've gone from plus 1% a year ago to plus 8% today. In both highways and private non-res, our markets are outperforming non-Vulcan served markets in starts growth. In addition, highway starts in Vulcan markets are up 7%. Although we have lowered our outlook for aggregate shipments in this calendar year, we see the second half of 2017 returning to growth.","The shortfall in aggregates volumes drove most of the gap between our reported results and expectations for the quarter. Shipment results are highly variable across geographies just like you'd expect given the dynamics I mentioned earlier. For example, shipments for Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were down 12% compared to the prior-year second quarter, well off trends and expectation. This was largely due to weather and its impact on project timing. At the same time, Illinois and Coastal Texas shipments were down 19% and 12% respectively. This was driven by severe reductions in large project work. Yet our backlogs in coastal Texas and Illinois, like most of our markets are very strong and growing.","Our other markets combined saw shipment growth of over 6%. This is much more in line with expectation and trend. This growth came despite very tough weather in the East, with the West showing very strong shipments, as expected. It is important to note that the factors negatively impacting second quarter shipments are contradicted by strong underlying demand trends. In fact, looking behind the quarter's reported numbers, I'm very encouraged by what I see.","Leading indicators for shipments continue to strengthen, with public construction beginning to exit from the lull experienced over the last 12 months. Private demand continues to recover across most of our footprint, with key states such as California and Virginia showing renewed momentum. Long-term project pipelines for both private and public transportation work continue to build. And now, we're seeing the rate of starts for transportation infrastructure projects returning to growth. A year ago, these starts for Vulcan markets were down 16% on a trailing 12-month basis. This led to a drag on our shipments. Today they're up 7%, and we're seeing meaningful improvements in our backlogs in markets ranging from California to Illinois to Georgia.","Customer confidence remains very strong given this visibility, and the pricing climate remains positive. Pricing for the quarter was up about 6%, taking into account product and geographic mix. On a normalized basis, our cash margin per ton in aggregates improved by 7%. Now, this is despite wet material, which is hard to process; on-again, off-again production schedules; and expensive production splits. To give you a better feel for the quarter, I'll briefly compare and contrast two of our important states, California and Georgia. They illustrate clearly the variability in the quarter, but also the quality of the profit improvement that we're seeing at the local level.","In California, we saw volume improve by 10%. This is the beginning of the recovery we saw coming in 2016. Pricing improved by 7%, and overall unit profitability improved by 49%. This is consistent with the strong operating leverage that we enjoy. This California growth reflects a strong and strengthening private market, and this is before we feel the impact of additional state and local highway funding of approximately $6 billion per year. This will drive dramatic improvement in the public market. In California, we are also a major supplier to massive projects like the new Rams stadium, which was delayed slightly in the first quarter and has now begun shipping.","Now to Georgia. For those of you close to the industry, you know Georgia is a strong market. However, in the quarter things slowed down considerably due to DoT delayed projects and weather. For example. Atlanta had 25 rain days in May and June. These factors contributed to a volume decline of 13%. But I'm not worried about Georgia, Georgia is going to be fine. The fundamental demand outlook remains solid. It is supported by both private construction activity and a defined slate of public transportation projects. Pricing for the quarter in Georgia rose a healthy 8%. This is a strong sign of underlying demand strength.","We lowered our volume expectations for the year, which lowered our guidance range. This is due to compression of shipping days and the timing of large projects that we know are going to ship. In addition, I'm very pleased by our growing project backlogs, growing public and private starts, and the growing preconstruction pipeline. We feel confident that we will return in the second half of the year to a sustained period of growth. To underscore the point, the backlog of large projects in Georgia where Vulcan will be the major supplier continues to swell. Big highway projects like the I-75\/16 work in Macon and the I-285\/400 expansion in Atlanta have been delayed by the DOT as well as by weather. But they will start to ship soon.","Now I'll hand it off to John, who will walk you through the details of the quarter and discuss outlook and financing activities.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to begin by underscoring that our business remains on track with our long-term goals for mid-cycle profitability. Aggregate shipment shortfalls to date led us to reduce our outlook for the current calendar year. But at the same time, key leading indicators for shipments for the balance of this year and beyond have strengthened in important ways. The pricing climate continues to reflect this confidence in the sustained recovery, and more tactically, the healthy backlogs we and our customers see. The operating leverage inherent in our aggregates-focused model remains intact. And where we've seen good revenue growth, we've seen good flow-throughs. Our expectations for free cash flow growth also remain unchanged.","Now I'll dig a bit further into our outlook for the balance of the year. As you've seen, we are lowering our guidance for 2017 due to our reduced expectation for aggregates shipments. We now anticipate full-year shipments of between 182 million tons and 187 million tons. A few comments regarding our outlook for the second half. Starts data for public transportation infrastructure projects historically serve as a reliable leading indicator of our shipments to that end-use, with a lag depending upon the nature of the project. The turn we are now seeing is due to a higher proportion of larger, more complex projects, and as such can drive a longer lag between a project start and our shipment of aggregates to that project.","That said, we're pleased to see the turn in this indicator for our markets, as well as the solid growth in our internal backlogs. We take these as clear signals that we are exiting the lull in public transportation shipments experienced over the last 12 months and returning to a next wave of growth, one characterized by strength in public demand joining the continuing recovery in private demand.","The long-term pre-construction pipeline continues to build, and we're finally beginning to see that core demand flow through to growth and project starts and our own shipments. Now again, private starts momentum remains solid across Vulcan's footprint, and in fact, it's already showing up in our shipments. For example, we are experiencing particular strength in shipments to private end-uses across the Southeast, and now in Virginia and California as well.","So we feel very good about the fundamental demand drivers and about the leading indicators in near-term shipments. But for the second half of 2017, we remain cautious regarding the ultimate timing of shipments to selected large projects, as well as the ability of our customers to fully catch up on work deferred from the first half. In addition, the turn in starts and shipments related to public transportation projects, although very encouraging, has come a bit late in some markets to fully impact 2017 as originally expected.","Of note, our aggregate shipments for July were up 2% over the prior year. Most Southeastern markets showed improved momentum as the month progressed and as weather improved. However, we've yet to see a full return to growth in Illinois and Coastal Texas despite strong backlogs in those markets.","Our lowered volume outlook primarily reflects the simple reality of the number of shipping days left in the calendar year. We see a return to solid growth but don't know that we can fully catch up to our original guidance in the months remaining. Our current outlook for the remainder of the year, August through December, implies 5% to 10% growth in aggregate shipments over the prior-year period. Our trajectory for unit profitability remains unchanged. And as noted, same-store average selling prices for aggregates advanced 5% in the quarter despite volume headwinds and certain mix headwinds.","On a normalized basis, unit cash margins improved by about 7%, again despite difficult operating conditions at many plants. Our cost disciplines remained sound, and in the markets where we've seen meaningful freight-adjusted revenue growth, we've experienced greater than 60% flow-through to segment gross profit. In addition, certain transitory cost issues, such as our transition to new, more efficient ships, will be behind us by the end of the year. We remain on track with our long-term pricing and margin improvement expectations.","Now I'll close with a few comments regarding our recent financing activity and our current financial position. Through a series of financing and refinancing actions since the beginning of 2016, we have been able to fund high quality growth capital investments while at the same time, moving closer toward our target debt structure. After paying down our 2018 maturities in July, our weighted average interest rate has dropped from 6.5% to 4.8%. The weighted average duration of our debt has extended from 7 years to 13 years. Annualized after-tax interest expense has grown by approximately $5 million.","The rating agencies were supportive of our announced agreement to purchase Aggregates USA and the financing actions associated with that transaction. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade position throughout the cycle, and we should be in a position to pursue other smart growth opportunities as the recovery continues.","Tom, back over to you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, John. Now despite the volume shortfall, and our revised outlook for the full year, I'm very encouraged by the way many key indicators improved during the quarter, and by what that foreshadows for the second half of 2017 into 2018 and beyond. This time last year, California and Virginia were relatively soft. Now they are demonstrating renewed momentum. Coastal Texas, although weak so far this year, should begin to deliver on a solid backlog of work as delayed projects kick off later this year. And we remain very confident about the Southeast, given continued growth in both public and private demand. Public transportation projects starts returned to positive territory. The pricing climate remains very positive. Our customers are confident, and our recent acquisitions have performed well so far.","Now, speaking of acquisitions, I want to comment briefly on our progress related to the Aggregates USA acquisition, and also in general about the M&A market. Regarding Aggregates USA, we are on track with this important acquisition, and the more we learn the more excited we become. Their management team and workforce are outstanding, and the synergies are all there and work well for us. This transaction is the one that checks all the boxes.","Operational synergies will include plant efficiencies due to balancing product mix. We will have cost synergies for managing our rail fleet more efficiently. We will serve new customers and serve our existing customers in different ways, with the right product at the right time and at the right place. We are also obviously \u2013 we obviously also have back-office synergy. And lastly, we realize that in any acquisition, we have great opportunities to learn from the new business and its people. We continue to evaluate a number of bolt-on M&A opportunities. The M&A environment is rich right now, but we will stay disciplined, and that means staying focused on the types of synergies that I just described.","And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for all the color, Tom and John. I'd like to discuss the pricing environment today and what you feel about execution. So two questions. First, you provided a lot of color around your expectations for volumes in the second half of the year, and I was hoping you'd provide some color about the pricing environment in the second half of the year, and kind of how much confidence your customers have given what you were talking about as backlog and some increased activity in both public and private markets. So just to make it a little cleaner, what are your expectations for pricing, and what gives you confidence in your ability to realize better pricing momentum going into 2H?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'd describe the pricing environment right now kind of two words and that's vision and confidence. I think our customers see \u2013 they know the backlogs, the work they have, they see the work is coming. There's going to be a lot of pent-up demand. And so, it's a very good environment for pricing because of that.","Now, I think that with some of the hard-to-produce products, asphalt sizes that are hard to produce and more expensive to produce, you may see prices go up faster and higher, particularly over the next year or two, particularly due to the rising highway demand and asphalt \u2013 demand on asphalt sizes. But people really understand the work that's out there, Bob, and they know it's coming. So, they have a lot of ability to increase prices, all the way through the construction materials group.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Bob, just to clarify on guidance, our expectation for full-year pricing remains unchanged, our expectation for full-year unit margin improvement remains unchanged. Very much on track, despite second-quarter weather impacts. Again, the work is there, everybody sees it, even have some places that are a little bit tight. And so our focus is really just on how much of our product we can get on the ground, how quickly, in the remainder of the year.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Got it. That makes sense. And John, could you send a moment and talk about trends in unit profitability? You obviously had some volume headwinds, but you've got really good price in the first half. It looks like you're getting pricing and volume in 2H. What should be our expectations for unit profitability? And is there room for improvement? Are you guys happy with current execution, given the environment? Thanks, and good luck.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We're happy with current execution. I'll let Tom comment given the environment, I mean, it can always be better, but we're happy. If I step back from that, I'd say our unit profitability and that continuous compounding improvement in pricing and the unit profitability, from our perspective, is very much intact and continuing. If I step back from it, just to give you a few numbers or summarize a few numbers for the Aggregates segment for the quarter, the headwinds we've faced, profitability and total profits were almost all weather-related and volume-related, tied to weather. The way we look at it, we probably lost 4.5 million tons of shipments in the quarter due to weather and related project delays, that's probably a $40 million impact to gross profit. In terms of price, and we call this out in our materials we had about $0.16 of headwind due to product mix and geographic mix. That's probably another $8 million to $10 million of gross profit in the ag segment in the quarter.","And then in terms of cost reduction and Tom may comment on this further, we called out a couple of transitory effects, diesel and the cost of transitioning to our new ships; that was about $7.5 million of impact in the quarter. We probably had about a like impact, another $7.5 million roughly, from just operating in these wet, on-again, off-again operating conditions, and having a more difficult time leveraging fixed costs. So in total, the way we look at it, that's probably $60 million, $65 million of gross profit impact in the quarter largely due to volume and weather and selected project delays.","I say all that because we expect to return to more normal profitability and growth moving forward, and I think you'll see that reflected in our guidance if you kind of work that through. So profitability trajectory largely intact, execution good. Really just a question of getting the product on the ground in the balance of the year.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I'd add, John, I'd add to that, if you look step back and look at our operating people's performance in the quarter, they did a great job under tough circumstances \u2013 really tough circumstances. First of all, their safety performance was much improved. Our accidents went down 20%, reportable accidents, and our lost time accidents went down 35%.","So a great job on that, they're really taking care of each other, and that's taking care of business.","John said it best, when it comes to cost, the biggest impact was weather, and it was impact for the volume of weather and fixed-cost absorption. And then wet weather, as John said, you're starting and stopping plants, that's really inefficient, and it just slows you down. It's just harder to run sloppy material. And so we did the best we could with that, under the circumstances. And again, this is weather where it rains every other day, and that's just tough to work out of. And then we're also producing a higher percentage of asphalt sizes right now, and this is because of the visibility we have of all the highway work, and they're just smaller size, and they're just slower and harder to produce and more expensive to produce. But I think our ops teams continue to work hard to really work on their operating efficiencies, and it's obvious they're protecting each other, which is incredibly important.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sorry, just to recap that. So, your \u2013 you had great execution in the quarter, you have a positive outlook on both price and volume, and John, just to be specific on the record, you're expecting continued improvement in unit profitability in the second half of the year, correct?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes, the second half, and yes \u2013 and this is really what I'd underscore \u2013 yes, longer term, consistent with the longer-term goals we've laid out. So, yes.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Nice work in a tough environment. Good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hi, good morning, Jerry.","Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, this is Abdul Tambal on for Jerry.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Abdul.","Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, firstly can you just talk about what needs to happen for volumes to be up in that high single-digit range over the balance of the year? And would you need favorable weather to get there? So which regions do you see at that high end of the volume range, and which regions do you expect to lag?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think, if you look at where we stand from a demand perspective, and what's happened in the markets and I'd \u2013 it's all really good. The one place it may be a little soft is non-highway infrastructure and I'll come \u2013 Illinois \u2013 but I'll come back to those. So I'll start in the Mid-Atlantic. If you look at Virginia, we saw \u2013 have seen non \u2013 our volumes actually went up in the second quarter, despite tough weather; non-res has come back, housing's been healthy, highway continues to be healthy, we have good backlogs there.","Looking at Tennessee, Tennessee is a very healthy state and a little bit of a drag on highways, but that will fix, rectify itself with new funding, and the Tennessee DOT is trying to accelerate that spending, but it always takes a little time. Carolinas continue to be healthy, both public side and the private side and that's before we see flow-through of funding in South Carolina.","Georgia, as we say, is a very, very healthy market on all ends, and we have massive highway work coming in Georgia, to the tune of \u2013 I could name six large jobs that we have secured that total 8 million tons of shipments. It's just a matter of when they ship. Florida, continues to be good, both on the public side and on the private highway side. Alabama has been a little slow, it's actually growing on the private side, public's a little slow. If you look at the coastal market, growing.","Move to Texas, and we've called out coastal Texas and we'll see some big work flow through in coastal Texas, probably fourth quarter. We expected those to ship, both energy projects and highway projects, second quarter; they just got pushed back because of permitting on land, a number of issues. North Texas and Central Texas continue to be very healthy. We saw good growth in the second quarter in both of those. Arizona and New Mexico, while the private's been healthy, the highway work is really flowing through in those markets, and we'll get two pluses there because we're a big aggregates supplier and asphalt supplier, and our backlogs there are probably at records from highway work.","California has been a great story for us in the second quarter. We saw the price really driven by the private side. Private non-res has really flowed through there. Housing continues to be healthy. We see a little bit of pick-up in highway work, and remember now, in California, we are the largest supplier of aggregates and the largest supplier of asphalt, and we're in all the metropolitan markets, and this is before SB 1 flows through.","Illinois is a challenge. It's just going to be a challenge. The public side is tough. Believe it or not, we do see growth on res in Illinois, and we will see some bigger work that we have backlogged in Illinois flow through over the next 12 to 18 months. So if you just step back and look at the picture and get past the weather in the second quarter, this is a really, really good market. The starts have grown and the pre-construction pipeline is growing, both on the private side and now on the public side, and again, this is before we see flow-through of a lot of the new state highway funding. So as you step back and look at this, as I said in my opening remarks, we're very encouraged.","Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just ...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","If I could sum up, we'd just underscore the work is there, the uptick in starts that we would need to see has already happened. In many cases, we simply need to have a reasonable or as-expected pace of shipment to jobs that have already started. That'll be what we keep an eye on, and we need to see our customers be able to catch up on some of the small deferred private work that was delayed out of the second quarter. But from a demand perspective, as Tom said, we don't need anything \u2013 I'm going to call it \"new\" to happen. The work is there.","Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just on California, could you just talk a bit about what you're seeing there? Have you started seeing any of the emergency funding flowing through into the projects, and what are your expectations on when SB 1 can start to move the needle for your business there?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","There's you question. No, we've seen no flow-though. Remember, those funds don't start getting collected until November. Now, the state has been talked about as it's trying to accelerate that, they'll let 13 jobs this year, and then they're scheduled to let another 50 jobs, pending permitting and design. You'll see some work flow through, and a little bit flow through in 2018 maybe, and maybe some paving work or repair work, but the big work always takes 18 months to 24 months to really get going. So \u2013 and we just always, we want it to come through faster, there's a lot of promises to come through faster, but it's just tough to do. So I would tell you the earliest that'll be 2018, but it's really going to flow into 2019 and 2020 and beyond. So it's like I said, we're always disappointed it takes longer, but the work's coming and it is absolutely needed in that state.","Abdul Tambal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group, your line is open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you for taking my questions today. A follow-up on California ...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Good morning. For California last quarter, you talked about how California looks a lot like Texas did four years ago, and I've appreciated the color you've given in the call about that state, particularly with the 10% increase in volumes. But taking it a step further, and knowing that you're the largest aggregate and asphalt producer, could you give us a sense, in terms of breaking out the state growth, just as you did for Texas, but focusing on the L.A. market versus Northern, and the San Diego market, in terms of what is driving real demand in the market, both on the res, non-res side? And also, helping us understand the rough breakout in revenues between L.A. and your other markets, and how depressed demand is, particularly, in the L.A. market? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. First of all, the healthiest market in California right now is Southern California. And we're seeing \u2013 we've seen, in California, residential growth be healthy for a long time now, and it continues to grow. One of the big differences is non-res, particularly in Southern California, and as we saw in the preconstruction pipelines a year ago, and we talked about it's going to flow through, and it continues to build. So very exciting to Southern California on the private side.","Northern California has been a little slower on the non-res. Res continues to be healthy, but the pipeline is growing, and it will flow through. As you remember, we had a lull in, or a dip in state funding a little better than a year ago with some budget issues, they came back and put some funds back in. And so we're starting to see that growth, and we know that they're trying to accelerate the funding. So I'd describe Southern California as a little ahead. Northern California, it will come, and is following and the preconstruction, pipeline is filling on both. Just, like I said, Southern is little bit faster.","Now, as you saw in our numbers and you continue to see, with this visibility and the confidence and the jobs that are out there and what's coming, there is really good pricing momentum in California. We feel like, from a capacity standpoint, both in aggregates and in asphalt, we're physically in a great position, and ability to serve the market, we're in the best position.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","And could you just remind us, or break out \u2013 oh, go ahead. Go ahead, John.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I was going to just give you a rough breakdown, and this is very rough, it really depends on where you are kind of in the demand cycle a little bit, but our larger position is in Southern California, combination of L.A. and San Diego. You might think about that as roughly weighted two-thirds of our California presence. Northern California, Bay Area and up to Sacramento, the other third, including some of Central California. Those are very rough numbers.","I'd also just remind you that our reserve positions longer-term in California, in a state that has many depleting reserves, are really fantastic and unique. So it's just a very attractive position now and longer term. Finally, we'd underscore that the recent improvement is really driven by private demand. Kathryn, as \u2013 I know you know this, because you look at it so well, but the public demand is still working through a bit of a lull that was caused by the Caltrans funding uncertainty for a while. We think that'll turn around pretty quickly with the new funding in place, but what you're seeing right now is really driven by healthy private demand.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I would add one thing on, this is not the market, but our operating folks in California have done \u2013 made big improvements in the last year on operating efficiencies and synergies, and I've got to give them a real hand of \u2013 or applaud them for what they've done, and I think that will continue and only get better.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. And just one follow-up on coastal Texas. As you know, we talk to a wide variety of different building contacts along the value chain, and we received a little bit better feedback than what you talked about in that coastal kind of Houston market, seen flattening and even some slight improvement in the Houston market. Could you help us understand the delta between what our industry relationships are telling us, versus what you're seeing? And is this more a function of project mix, or is there something else fundamentally that we need to keep in mind?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","No, I think, the fundamentals in Coastal Texas are all there. I know you've got employment growth, you've got population growth. We've seen the residential side come back. Non-res has been kind of flat but starting to improve. Our real issue has been timing of projects, and it's both highway projects and energy projects that we thought we had slated to start in the first half of 2017, and they're probably pushed to the fourth quarter of 2017.","I'll give you some color on it, I'll give you some color. There's the Golden Pass LNG project and Sabine Pass, we thought would ship in 2017; it's actually got pushed back, it will not let until early 2018. Port of Freeport expansion has been pushed back by design, Chevron Phillips refinery upgrade was delayed. We saw State Highway 550, which is actually in the valley, we had environmental and permitting issues. And then the SH 288 Highway, which we thought would ship I guess second quarter, it got pushed back a little bit. So from our perspective, it's really timing of large work. I think that as I said earlier, the fundamentals are there, and I think that that is a market that is returning and getting a lot better, to your point.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Final question, this is Texas. There you have a big letting with the state, $1.1 billion in August. What is your real capacity for the state itself to adequately meet the demand for that big of funding, particularly if you're going from $3.2 billion to $5.5 billion to $6 billion this year, and growing even more the following year, should we expect additional delays, just because of capacity constraints? Or is the state, and our contractors and yourself able to adequately even meet that demand in future years? Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think that's one we'll have to wait and see. There will be some pressures on them, and tension there. We're hoping that they can get that all out and permitted and designed and in place, but as always with larger projects, it becomes \u2013 the time constraints could become more difficult. They are just more complex to design, you've got bigger permitting issues, you've got bigger right-of-way and land issues. So \u2013 and we're seeing that across all DOTs, particularly Texas, but you're starting to see a big increase of large projects.","And the good news for us is, whether it's Texas or anyplace else, that's right in our wheelhouse. We've got a lot of those backlogged, but there's a high percentage of those that we're just seeing take longer from when they start. And we've got a number of them started in 2016 and we're still not shipping rock, and it's a variety of complex designs, it's right-of-ways, it's permitting; some of it's obviously weather in the second quarter. But I'm not \u2013 I guess, I'm not worried about this, because the work's there, it's funded and it is coming. Just large projects are more complex and take longer, but once they go, we ship a better mix of product, and they go fast.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Good morning, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","I just want to follow up on that last comment. Tom, you mentioned with the increase of large projects, they are taking longer, and John, you also mentioned that the lag has extended some on the highway side. Just to get an idea, what \u2013 historically, what has been the lag there, and what is it now? So, we can kind of get an idea of, with starts picking obviously in the \u2013 on the highway side of things. I think you said Vulcan market is up 7%. Just to try to give us a sense for when those can flow through and how that lag has extended?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'd take a shot at it, Trey, just with the qualification that it's of course project-specific. These are often project-specific or state DOT specific circumstances. But historically at 12 months, 9 months to 12 months, and I think we've probably seen that on an average extend by 3-ish months. And again, it really varies by project, and again Tom gave you a sense, sometimes it's larger complex projects; sometimes it's design build efforts that get behind in the design phase, so they've started, but don't start taking aggregate shipments on the sort of previously agreed schedule.","So we've probably seen, to bring it down to this year. we've seen kind of the turn in starts and turn in large public transportation demand happen about as expected, but we've seen the actual shipment of those projects be six weeks, eight weeks later than expected. And frankly, that's reflected in our revised outlook for the year.","So \u2013 but again, it's highly \u2013 the only thing I would just sway is, this is also for the very large complex projects, it's also just a little bit less predictable. So, it's not just that we're getting it wrong, or it's not happening as quickly as we thought it was going to happen. It's not happening like the DOT thought it was going to happen, or the general contractor thought it was going to happen. It's just \u2013 I think a thing to keep in mind is, it's just that from a project-to-project basis, these large complex transportation projects, which are very good for us, the week-to-week, month-to-month shipping timing is just a little bit less predictable, and that's one of the things we tried to reflect in our revised guidance.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. All right. That all makes sense. And then also to kind of follow up on another question before, Tom, you named a lot of these projects, named off several that have been kind of pushed out a little bit that I think you guys had initially thought might come on a little earlier. Looking at that, what's your \u2013 what kind of visibility do you have, or I guess what's your sense for, as we sit here today, these projects that have been pushed a little bit, when those might come on? And I don't necessarily need project by project, but just a sense for your visibility there, and what's kind of embedded in the back half guidance for some of these delayed large projects?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Embedded in guidance, we've got a number of them that are starting to ship. We saw some ship a little bit in July, and they'll come on in August and September. And as I talked about Texas, we'll see some starting in the fourth quarter, I hope. But it is leveling out. I think we \u2013 and do not underestimate the impact of raining more than 50% of the time in May and June. It's not just DOT designs and right-of-way. When you have rain 15 days out of a month or 14 days out of a month, and it's spread out, the contractors just can't get on the job. And any day that we can cobble together four or five dry days, we see our shipments jump up all over the place.","So the work's there, and it's going to come, but it \u2013 so I think that we feel good, and our outlook for the second quarter of the work that's going to start, we have good visibility to that and have good contact with the contractors. And the good news is, the work's there.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Right. Got it. All right. And then ...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Trey, despite all this, we'd also say by the way, we like seeing more large complex projects.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Oh, yeah.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","So the timing is a little bit more complicated, but we're one of the very best positioned suppliers to meet the kind of needs of those projects, and \u2013 so we actually like that trend. It does make the very near-term predictability of shipments a little more difficult. But these aren't things that are going anywhere, they're not getting \u2013 this is weeks of delay in putting aggregate on the ground. It's not changing whether or not they do the project.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Right. And then once they start, the visibility is there?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And once ...","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","So on ...","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, once they actually get going and past grading and that kind of stuff to taking our product, they go quickly. The other thing I would say is, we talked a lot about capacity constraints in the sector. This really isn't where the capacity constraint is, Trey. When you get going on these big jobs, if you will, you can get a lot of aggregate down per unit of labor.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. All right, that makes sense. Well, just speaking of labor, I will ask you this on the downstream, with looking at ready-mix drivers or pavers or that sort of thing, as we kind of look through any kind of spikes in volume and projects and things like that coming on, do your customers or do you have any concern about that end of things creating a bottleneck and maybe delaying things, maybe things wouldn't be quite as good as they would have been otherwise as a result of just not being able to find the labor? Just any opinion you have on that?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think from Vulcan's perspective, we're okay, and we continue to add, and we \u2013 both quality of employees and quantity of the employees. From our customers' perspective, and John said it very well a minute ago, on the large highway work, that's not going to be a big constraint. And those folks are really putting in on and prepared, because they have visibility to what's coming and they have time to do that, and that's going to continue to flow through. Now, there will be, on concrete work, probably more pressures, and I think those, our customers are working hard to address drivers and finishers and framers. But it will be a natural tension, probably a little more short-term than long-term, and it will come and go. But I think long term it won't be a bottleneck, it will be just be some tension.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I do think if we step back a little bit, Trey \u2013 and Tom, you might, I know you're talking to customers about this all the time, but if we looked at a year ago, our customers were pretty reluctant to make investments ahead of the election and things we talked about back then. It feels very different now, because our customers are talking about and actively trying to make those investments in their own capacity.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, they see what's coming and they've got bigger backlogs.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. That \u2013 got it on that, it makes sense. Last one's a housekeeping, so it will be quick, is just the $7.5 million you called out from the transition to ships, and I think it was the first couple of quarters here we've seen that. And you think it's going to maybe be a little bit going forward. How much do we need to be kind of modeling in or baking in to \u2013 for that? Which I'm sure is in your guidance, whatever it's going to be, but just to try to get a sense for pure aggregates? And then also, just what does the product mix in the backlog look like for the back half, as far as you can tell? Are you expecting any kind of impact at all from mix as we look into the back half of this year? Just so we're clear on how to model all these things?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. And obviously happy to follow up afterwards also, Trey, with you or anyone else. To answer your question on transition to ships, we expect that cost \u2013 and it was a little over $5 million in the quarter \u2013 I'd expect that to repeat again in the third quarter, and then ramp down in the fourth quarter as we get new ships delivered and get those online. But yes, incorporated in guidance. Diesel will be a little bit of headwind in the second half of the year, but not \u2013 it was about a $2 million headwind in the quarter, and should be about the same moving forward. And again, over time that should get reflected in pricing, and as we talked about before, higher diesel prices over time are in some ways a good thing for our business. So I think that's the answer on those tactical items; I'll let Tom comment on product mix.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah, I would summarize product mix in the second half as probably normal. But you'll have two offsetting pressures. The new projects will take a higher percentage of fines and base, and that's really good for us. The flip side of that is you've got a lot asphalt backlog out there, with big highway work, and also non-res and the res will take lot of concrete work. So rising waters in both of the different sizes there, so I would tell you normalized.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Great.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And Trey, one of the things I know we talked about it in the past, just to revise, we talked \u2013 way back about a year ago, we talked a lot about rising repair and maintenance costs. And we feel pretty good about where we are in that now, they're basically flat or slightly down even in the quarter despite the other headwinds. So we do feel good that that period of rising R&M costs should largely be behind us, which is a good signal.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks a lot for answering the questions, guys, and good luck on the balance of the year. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Rohit Seth from SunTrust.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on that leading indicator you mentioned, the construction starts, you'd said that public highway was up 7%. Is that a year-to-date figure or is that for June?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Trailing 12 months as of June.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think that trailing 12 months figure's really the way you want to look at it on a \u2013 it can be noisy month-to-month, but I think the trailing 12-month figure is really the good leading indicator.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And it's not just that it's up, but that we've worked through a previous lull. And so it's returned to growth and is continuing to strengthen across our markets.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I would also add to that that, in a lot of places that's before the big funding flows through.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Oh, yeah.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","If you look at South Carolina or Tennessee or California, that \u2013 we haven't touch that, and so, more to come.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then as I'm listening to this call here, you sound incrementally positive, your commentary has been pretty bullish. As you think about your 2018 plan, I mean are you guys more incrementally positive on achieving those objectives, and how do you feel about timing, and \u2013 any thoughts there would be helpful?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think as John said, it really boils down in 2017 to the number of shipping days we have left that works there. And so whatever doesn't happen in 2017 is obviously not going to go away. We see growing how we starts, we see growing private starts, and the pipeline of preconstruction continues to fill. So while we feel good about the end of 2017, or the second half of 2017, I think we feel very good about 2018, 2019 and 2020, because like I said, the private side continues to be healthy and you've got very much a growing public side.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And I'd say, we're obviously not giving 2018 guidance right now, but as we sit here now, given the backlogs we see and the discussions we have with customers, and the public funding developments and all of the things we've talked about, I think we would be really surprised if we weren't entering 2018, we and our customers, with very strong backlogs and with a very positive outlook. And when you look at the start data, which is part of why we emphasized it in our materials, it would suggest we're returning to another wave of growth in this long recovery. It would suggest we're entering a period in many of our markets that have public and private clicking together in growth.","A little bit analogous to where we stood in the second half of 2013, except that as we sit here right now, we've got substantially higher prices, substantially higher margin per ton, and a stronger balance sheet, and some key acquisitions coming online. So we're pretty excited about the outlook, as you can tell. And that's 2018 and beyond. But again, without trying to give guidance, we'd be really surprised if we weren't \u2013 we and our customers entering next year with strong and healthy backlogs and strong and healthy outlook.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then for long-term thinking here, I tend to think in upcycle, volumes will grow anywhere from 3% to 4%, perhaps 5% in the upcycle. And when you think about public and private clicking at the same time, is 5% a good long-term run rate, or you think, given where things are, where do you see them today, perhaps even better than that?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll take a shot, based on \u2013 I'll comment on things we've said publicly elsewhere, just to be clear. But the demand is there to grow at faster rates. Just the pent-up demand is there to grow at a much faster rates. You could look at any of the end-use segments and you'd see it. And increasingly, the funding is there to grow at faster rates. That said, I think when you have a portfolio as broad as ours, across as many markets as we're in, and when eventually do have some realistic constraints, but how quickly DOTs get jobs out and how quickly the construction factor can meet that demand, 5% to 7% is probably a better assumption than 10% to 12%, just to give you a feel.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","The demand is there to grow at faster rates. There will be periods when we grow at faster rates, there are individual markets that you've seen that grow at faster rates. But across the whole portfolio and over a longer period of time, we still see a \u2013 a more gradual, steady, sustained extended recovery. But at the same time, I'd say you look at the demand picture and it's hard to argue why it couldn't grow more quickly.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","All of that still supports a good climate for pricing and a good climate for compounding profit improvement. And we still find very encouraging, particularly once we see the construction start activity on the public side continue to pick up.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Is it fair to say that your pricing is \u2013 has been moving above inflation for a while now, and is it fair to say, the cycle matures, you can continue to get that? Is that a realistic assumption?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think it's a function of what's happening out there in the market from a demand, and as I always say the visibility and confidence. And if you look at what goes on, particularly in the private sector, which is very healthy, continuing to grow and well below kind of normalized levels, and then as, again, you put on top of that what's happening from a highway perspective, yeah, prices \u2013 the pricing climb will be healthy for years to come.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you, okay. And my last question, just on resi. I know resi has been good, everybody is talking about resi's good, Single Family is leading. How much of the Single Family is coming from new communities as opposed to in-fill, and if you could just maybe highlight some strengths and weaknesses by geography and what you're seeing in community development, if at all? And ...","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think, if you step back and look at res in our markets, demand's up high single-digits. But Single Family is up much higher, it's up double-digit, and really the driver right now. And that growth is supported by subdivision development and construction, really with smaller homes and it's affecting a lot of first-time buyers and younger buyers. And if you look at demographics that's really good, because there's a lot of them out there. So \u2013 and the good news about that is, that kind of construction is very aggregate-intensive, both with new subdivisions and a lot of houses. So we're pleased with the res, and it is broad based across our footprint. It's hard to find a market that doesn't have good healthy residential growth.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, thank you.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Hey, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. First is a housekeeping question, just around your volume guidance for the second half of the year, the 5% to 10% increase. To be clear, does that include the acquisitions that you made in the first quarter?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes. They don't have a big impact on volume, but yes. On aggregates volume, by the way they \u2013 a couple of our acquisitions are in our concrete and asphalt segment primarily. So the answer to that question is yes, but Garik I want to be clear the 5% to 10% is really August through December. The squeeze we're doing is really looking at our hand after July, seeing where we are. So I think if you did second half, it's probably equivalent of something like 4% to 8%. Just keeping in mind that July was up 2%. Stronger in the second half of July, but that's really what, as much as anything, is causing us to think about the squeeze for the balance of the year, is August through December.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I don't want to harp too much on July, was most of the, I guess, the relative softness compared to the rest of the back-half guidance. Weather-driven again?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think July is easy to explain, the first two weeks it rained, the second two weeks we put a lot of work together. And the second two weeks were very healthy. So \u2013 and again, as we said, in lot of these cities we had 10 days of rain in July and still went up 2%.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","And also (58:10) some continued weakness in Houston and Illinois were up 3%, and the trend is pretty good, but Garik, you know this very well, I think you looked at some of the squeeze in some of your work I thought it was well done, but it's just that number of fewer construction days we have left in the season. So anyway, that was \u2013 did I answer your question?","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. And thanks for the kind words. My second question is on the highway outlook. You talked about an improving outlook here, but I'm just wondering, is there any risk or any chatter around the uncertainty on the federal side with respect to the debt ceiling and these continuing resolutions that we're under? Is that an impact, or I guess has that been an impact in the first half of the year? Is that a potential impact as you look as far as continued project timing delays in the second half of the year?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think the answer to that question is no, it's not an impact. The FAST Act's secure and we're seeing those funds flow through. It's been very good for us. I don't think a lot of it's hit yet. And remember, that passed in November of 2015, takes \u2013 again, it takes 18 to 24 months to flow through. But I think we're secure about that. I think what everybody's working on right now is what we do three or four years from now. And I think there's a lot of momentum in D.C. to address the Highway Trust Fund. Both parties want this to happen. It's not a matter, again you hear us say this a lot, it's not a matter of if, but when and how. We saw back in the summer 200 members of congress sign a letter to fix the trust fund. So I think it's going to be addressed, but I don't see any threats to federal funding at this point.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Garik, I do think \u2013 and I'll apologize for this being a little bit anecdotal, just as it relates to 2017. So, I think Tom summarized the forward outlook very well. But I think earlier this year, when there was a lot of talk about a $1 trillion infrastructure program very early in the year, we probably had some DOTs and some local governments, particularly some local governments, just kind of waiting and holding back on some starts, wondering if the rules were going to change. I think they're past that now, and in some ways this will be better for everybody if it was just quiet until we had an agreement on something. In the meantime, it's a distraction for everybody.","But I think most of the DOTs, the people we're working with, are past that. And frankly, now that they've got new funding passed \u2013 and you know this in many states, they have a little bit of political pressure to show progress. And so that's part of why you see Tennessee and South Carolina and California doing what they can do to put forward some spending, just to show some progress. So in any event, I think it was maybe a little bit of a distraction for some DOTs early in the year. I think we felt that, a little bit right now, but I think we're past it.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great, that's helpful. Thanks. Thanks again.","Operator","We'll move next to Scott Schrier from Citi.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a quick one on the downstream. Looks like you continue to have strong growth there, especially in concrete. Just wanted to see what you're seeing there in Texas and Virginia? On the concrete you had nice pricing, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. So I just wanted to see what some of the drivers there were, and how to think about it going forward?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. Our volumes were up in all of our concrete markets. The big margin improvement came in Northern Virginia and Texas, California is \u2013 which is new to us \u2013 performed very well. We're very pleased with that. I think overall we're very pleased with our concrete performance, and I think that the teams out there have done a really good job of executing, both on servicing our customers and on being efficient from an operating cost perspective.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Because our biggest concrete market's still in Virginia, when you see that improvement, it's a little bit of an indicator of the strong private demand in Virginia, we talked about before, because that really drives more of the concrete usage for us there.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then on the comments regarding the strong shipment growth of 6% in Virginia-Carolinas-Tennessee, and I know that you had parsed out the overall volumes that you lost in the quarter due to mostly weather and some delays, is there any way to get a sense of what that 6% would have been ex the weather in those particular markets?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","I'll take a short at it. First, I would say it would have been higher. So you had \u2013 you did have weather impacts in South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia. So absolutely it would have been higher. I think, when we gave the estimate earlier of about 4.5 million tons lost to weather, in selected project laid in the quarter, that amount would have incorporated in what we would have seen as a hit in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Carolinas-Virginia-Tennessee.","What I'd say is those markets would have been a bit better. They did have tough weather, if you look at the rain days across key markets in those states, but a little bit better working it through. And they also had \u2013 their weather impact was a little bit earlier in the quarter. What really hit Georgia and Florida in particular for us was tough weather in late May and June, when by definition you don't have time to catch up in the quarter.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you. I don't believe you touched on this, apologize if you did, but the SAG outlook for \u2013 still $320 million for the year, implies something around $9 million less in the second half than the first half. I guess I was a little surprised by that, just given maybe some coming costs to get Aggregates USA completed. Any more color there?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Our outlook for SAG is unchanged. You have some timing differences due to accruals and incentives and other things, quarter-to-quarter. Fundamental outlook for SAG unchanged. What I would say is that we remain intensively focused on G&A productivity, on the one hand, and we remained equally focused on making smart investments in our sales and customer service capabilities. So on the Yes component, if you will. But overall outlook for that for the year, unchanged.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then maybe just from a bigger picture perspective, Illinois, not a new issue in terms of being a tough market, headlines are clearly out there. But I know you guys kind of think about the business for the long term, kind of just refresh your stance on the market, need for Vulcan to be there, maybe any green shoots you think you could develop over the next few years in that market?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. I think the \u2013 right now, IDOT is just in tough shape. The public sector's been hit hard, you've had no state budget for two years; the DOT stopped work temporarily in the second quarter, we've seen them crank it back up. From our perspective, we've got better backlogs than we've had. Our backlogs are growing in Illinois. We've got some big jobs that were delayed, particularly O'Hare runway. If you step back and look at Illinois and remember demand is driven by population, and Chicago is not going away and they'll have to fix their problems. And again, this is one of those that's not if they're going to fix it, but when they're going to fix it and how.","So \u2013 and our position in Illinois is very good. I think under very difficult circumstances, our teams in Illinois have done a very good job maximizing profitability and being efficient and servicing customers. So while it's tough right now, we do think it's \u2013 in the long term, and remember this is a long-term business, that long term, it will be a solid market and we have the premier position in Chicago. So while it's tough, again it's a long-term business, and we're in for the long haul.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah. And Tom, with that position, are you guys \u2013 and in this environment \u2013 are you guys still able to get a little price in that market?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yes. We've had actually decent price increases in Illinois, and we've upped our game on servicing our customers, and position is important and we're getting paid for it.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you. Best of luck.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Just in terms of the year tasked in Illinois, we had obviously, we kind of would have expected it to have bottomed out by now. We didn't expect Illinois to be strong this year in terms of volume growth, but we didn't expect it to continue to drop like it has. So we foresaw some of the weakness, but we didn't see the kind of crisis around the budget, again, that Tom mentioned \u2013 and you may know this because it was publicized \u2013 frankly caused bills to stop being paid and caused work to stop. So we're still working through some of that in 2017. But again, it's a very healthy and profitable position long-term beyond 2017.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Stanley Elliott from Stifel, your line is open.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thank you, guys to fit me in. Most everything has been answered. Quick question though, on the Ag USA deal. In the release it mentioned the prospects of having to do some divestitures. Where are you all in that process? After looking at that portfolio, what percentage do you think you'll end up having to divest? Any thoughts around that would be great.","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","Yeah. To answer your question, we're still in the process with the DOJ, and that's a normal process and it's going along. But it's way too early to try to speculate on what we have to divest or where, what and when. But I would say this much, as we get into that project and into that acquisition and look at the quality of it, and as I said in my opening comments, we're really excited about it. This is a very good business, it has very strong assets, great positions, great reserves, and their people are very professional and very good. So we're \u2013 while we're going through the process, and as \u2013 which is normal \u2013 I think the more we spend time with this, the more excited we are about welcoming this into the Vulcan family.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then you kind of, throughout the call, you've mentioned permitting problems being a culprit for a lot of the delays for some of these large projects. Certainly the administration had \u2013 was trying to push more streamlined regulatory reform. Is that impacting your business at all? What are the prospects for any changes on the regulatory front to kind of open up some of these bottlenecks, if you will?","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","Well, I think, as you know, we rescinded the Waters of the U.S., which was a big win. I'm sure there will be legal action with that, but, it was just the right thing to do. And right now the administration knows these issues with us \u2013 I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we had a big issue with our big Macon job which got held up with land and had some permitting issues, and we're now having a number of them in Texas. So it is a real issue. I mean, it's out there.","Right now, the administration is gathering suggestions on what needs to be done to speed this up. So they know it's a problem, I think they're fact-finding right now, and I think we feel good that they're going to take some action on this, because it just needs to happen for \u2013 to rebuild our infrastructure, and to give people the ability to speed up these projects and get work done that needs to be done.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Do you think that has to be a part of like an executive action, or is this part of a larger infrastructure build?","J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.","I think it may be both. I think you see some of both with that.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, guys. Thanks very much. And best of luck.","John R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.","We've seen streamlining already in the FAST Act, I mean there is a lot of momentum behind this, it's just \u2013 and also, we'd also just say, keep in mind with these very large, complex projects, the larger more complex they are, the more opportunities there are for hold-up. You could have one right-of-way hold up a larger job. So again, it just makes a little bit less predictable, week-to-week, month-to-month, in terms of exactly when we're going to be shipping to the job.","But ultimately, it's very good for us, because there are very few people who have the capabilities to service these kind of jobs, particularly in these markets. So good development for us long-term to see this higher proportion of large jobs in the mix. Frankly, you see it in non-res also. But short term can lead to some longer lags between start and actual shipment of aggregates.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I understand. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","J.

My name is Lynette and I will be your conference call coordinator today.","As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company\u2019s prepared remarks.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to your host, Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Please go ahead.","Mark Warren","Good morning to everyone. Thank you for your participation in our earnings call. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website, vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage.","Please be reminded that comments regarding the company\u2019s results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks are described in detail in the company\u2019s SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these GAAP financial measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Hill","Thank you, Mark. And thank all of you for joining us for our call today. We have several important topics to cover. The Aggregates USA acquisition, the impact of tax reform, points on improving demand and pricing fundamentals, and of course, our overall financial expectations for 2018. I'll begin with a recap of the fourth quarter and the year.","The pattern of shipments in the quarter was encouraging. November, December aggregates shipments posted double-digit gains over the prior year. And this was following slight declines in October's daily shipments due to lingering storm impacts. When the weather was good, shipments were strong. This was consistent with underlying demand improvement and the need to catch up on delayed work.","Aggregates freight adjusted pricing in the quarter improved 2% over the prior year, and 4% for the full year. This is adjusted for geographic and product mix. High single-digit full-year pricing growth in California and Georgia reflected good visibility to continue demand recovery in those key states.","In contrast, pricing in Texas declined 4% in the quarter. This was largely due to Hurricane Harvey's continued impact on job mix in the coastal region, and on freight distribution costs that couldn't be passed through immediately.","Now these were temporary challenges, and our longer-term pricing strategy and expectations remain unchanged. We didn't perform as well in the quarter converting solid revenue growth into incremental gross profit. Several margin headwinds negatively impacted gross profit in aggregates by approximately $20 million. In addition to the price mix headwinds, we experienced a 23% rise in the unit cost of diesel fuel.","There were additional costs related to the transition to two new more efficient Panamax class ships and for storm-related ship loading and barge movement. We also absorbed certain expenses related to operations that we acquired during the year. We view these as temporary headwinds.","We expect a return this year to the longer-term flow through rates and compounding unit margin improvements that we typically have delivered throughout the recovery. I'm very pleased that we ended the year with the best safe performance in our company's 60-year history.","Our accident rate in 2017 was less than one incident for every 200,000 employee hours worked. Now our goal is zero and approximately 70% of our facilities are there already having experienced zero injuries in the past several years. I give great credit to our local leaders and the commitment of our workforce.","Now, stepping back a bit and setting aside for a moment the achievement of our world-class safe performance, I will say bluntly that 2017 was in other important ways a frustrating year. Yes, there were extreme weather events, they were very challenging, they disrupted our operations and our customers businesses in major ways and for prolonged periods.","The pace of public construction activity in 2017 was also frustrating. DOTs continue to adjust to new and higher levels of funding, resulting in a more complex mix of larger projects creating delays. A number of large jobs experienced significant start delays. In some cases, further compounded by bad weather.","Going into 2017 our customers and we, expected highway and infrastructure shipments to increase by about 3%, instead they declined by 7%. Last but hardly least, in some instances, I was less than satisfied with our own operating performance. It became quite clear that operating conditions were going to be unusually difficult throughout much of the year, with material shipment delays and other cost pressures.","Some of our teams adjusted very well, others not well enough in my view. Taken as a whole, we have room to improve and we\u2019re doing so. While there were from frustration in 2017 we also had some real wins. The fundamentals that underpin our long-term strategy continue to strengthen, the core drivers of demand for our materials improved.","Pricing dynamics and our operating capabilities continue to get better. And our asset portfolio grew and is now stronger. Our tax position and cash flows and our balance sheet all have continued to improve over the past year.","Regarding recovery in demand for our materials we continue to see a long runway with private demand strong across most markets. On the private side, 2017 saw continued growth in household formation, [permitting] [ph] activity, contractor backlogs and notably related construction employment.","All of this points towards a sustained recovery in demand. Customer confidence strengthened throughout the year and we've entered 2018 encouraged by what we're seeing with ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index, long-term project pipelines and other leading indicators. These and other factors suggest private demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster across the nation as a whole.","The long-term fundamentals for public demand also strengthened over the past year. Public demand is finally beginning to turn into what looks like an extended period of growth. With actions taken by California, Tennessee and South Carolina in 2017, nine of the states we serve representing more than 75% of our revenues have now meaningfully raised long-term road construction funding.","Our order backlogs related to public infrastructure work have continued to build. And importantly, we have recently seen public construction start activity return to year-over-year growth signaling a better conversion of these backlogs into shipments.","Now, it is certainly going to take multiple years for public construction activity to ramp up fully to these new higher levels of funding. But for many of our markets, 2018 should represent an inflection point at the front end of several years of sustained growth. Improved visibility reinforces a positive pricing plan.","This climate is further supported by customer confidence, expanding contractor margins, higher cement prices, rising diesel, and other distribution costs, and in certain markets such as California, a growing imbalance between long-term mature demand and available supply.","I'll remind you that higher diesel and distribution costs will ultimately help expand the economic moat around our quarries. In any given period, our reported average sales price will be impacted by mix and other timing factors and there will be periods of relatively faster and slower growth. But the fundamental trend for Aggregates pricing remains clear.","Our asset portfolio has strengthened meaningfully over the past year further supporting our long-term growth. A prime example of this, we welcome Aggregates USA, the Aggregates USA team to Vulcan at the end of December. We are really pleased with this organization that is now part of the Vulcan family.","The acquired quarries and rail yards fit our network nicely. And our new colleagues have already brought new ideas to the table. We expect to realize significant synergies in plant production, rail car utilization, product offerings and growing customer relationships in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. We expect these operations to contribute approximately [$50] [ph] million to EBITDA in 2018 and growth beyond that.","As markets continue to recover as Georgia DOT projects ramp up and as longer-term synergies are captured. This was the largest acquisition of the year, but it certainly wasn't the only important addition in 2017. We completed another seven transactions during the year at a combined value of $226 million.","In particular, I would note our acquisition of Shamrock, a leading ready-mixed concrete producer and material distributor in the Bay Area. And of LoJac a major asphalt producer in Nashville. Over the past three years we've invested over $1.2 billion in M&A and internal growth projects to complement our long-term growth.","Yet during this time our balance sheet has strengthened. Our total debt has increased by $875 million, but our cash interest expense has declined by $10 million. In 2017, we recovered investment grade credit ratings, which we intend to retain.","The recently enacted Tax Reform law also improves our current and long-term earnings and cash flow trajectory. We expect our total effective tax rate to drop from 28% to 20%. Our company grew stronger and more valuable in 2017. We are looking toward \u2013 we are looking forward to continuing top line growth and earnings improvement in 2018.","Now, I'd like to hand it off to John to recap our 2018 guidance and investment plan. John?","John McPherson","Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. First, let me point out that appendix 3 in the press release financials bridges reported to adjusted EPS for the quarter. We have followed our common practice for example in excluding the impacts of one-time tax items and debt refinancing costs.","The $20 million of margin headwinds in the Aggregates segment that Tom mentioned was not adjusted out. Well, of course be happy to answer any questions you have regarding these items or the tax provision off line.","As you saw in our release our 2018 guidance, calls for earnings per share of between $4 and $4.65, for growth of approximately 40% over 2017\u2019s adjusted EPS. We expect adjusted EBITDA and including the impact of Aggregates USA operations of between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.","For our Aggregates segment we expect same store of volume growth between 4% and 6%, generally consistent with the outlook we shared in our most recent call. Continued expansion of private construction activity drives most of the expected year-over-year growth.","Although the intermediate to longer term leading indicators for public construction continue to strengthen and certain markets will experience very solid growth in the current year. Our current overall expectation is for shipments to public end users to be up only at the low single digits compared to 2017.","Inclusive of Aggregates USA, we expect Aggregates shipments for the year to total in the range of 200 million tons. Although weather patterns and the timing of large projects can be difficult to predict, the first quarter should present the more difficult volume comparisons given the trends of the past three years.","For example, first quarter shipments in 2017 were approximately 30% higher than in 2014. As Tom noted, we expect same-store Aggregates average selling prices to be up 3% to 5%. The pricing climate remains constructive across most markets, and we expect price levels to build throughout the year as higher diesel costs flow through to pricing.","There has been no change to Vulcan's fundamental pricing strategies or our expectation for compounding price improvements over the longer term. We expect unit gross profits in Aggregates to expand by double digits consistent with the results seen earlier in the recovery cycle and consistent with certain cost headwinds not repeating in 2018.","We project gross profit in our asphalt and concrete segments to grow in the mid-single digits combined. These higher volumes are partially offset by modest margin pressure. Our earnings and EBITDA guidance assume SAG growth modestly to approximately $335 million, and to decline as a percent of revenues. We will continue to streamline certain administrative activities while investing in talent development and customer service capabilities.","Our current management -- other current management expectations, include interest expense of a $125 million, excluding refinance charges, operating and maintenance CapEx of $250 million, and as Tom noted an effective book tax rate of approximately 20%.","Our current or cash tax rate further benefits from the ability to immediately expense qualified capital investments. For 2018, we currently project cash taxes of $80 million, excluding the benefits of credits and refunds related to prior tax years. This projection for cash taxes would have been approximately $100 million higher under the prior tax law.","As you can see, we expect to generate solid free cash flow in 2018 and beyond, as the change in tax law further improves the already strong cash generation profile of our aggregate centric business. That said, our overall capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.","We will continue to appropriately reinvest in the maintenance and productive capacity of our physical plant. And we intend to maintain solid financial flexibility and an investment-grade credit profile.","There's 2015, we've funded meaningful growth while simultaneously improving our overall credit standing. During this period, our weighted average interest rate has declined from 7.5% to 4.3%, while the weighted average duration of our debt has increased from 8 years to 16 years.","We expect to maintain the progressive and sustained dividend. As you may have seen, the Board recently raised the dividend 12% to $0.28 a quarter. We will continue to invest in long-term growth, both internally and through M&A activities.","For 2018, we expect to invest $350 million in internal growth projects, including new strategic quarries and reserve positions in Texas and California. And we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders.","Although, we will continue our disciplined pursuit of bolt-on acquisitions during 2018, our primary focus will remain on building Aggregates\u2019 units margins, well executing internal growth projects, and fully capturing the synergies from recent acquisitions.","Tom, back to you.","Tom Hill","Thanks, John. As we move into 2018, we're very pleased with our portfolio. Now, we're always evaluating strategic investments, divestments and swaps in order to strengthen this portfolio. Our current footprint aligns very well with profitable growth this year and ramping into 2019.","For example, we like what we're seeing with the growing demand in our southeastern market. It is supported by new highway funding, port and intermodal transport development, superior employment growth, and favorable demographics, both population and household formation. Acquisitions such as LoJac and Aggregates USA will play an important role here.","Arizona, California and Texas are also strong on these same fronts and recent results in California are particularly exciting for us. We like a long-term position there. California will benefit significantly from increased public spending, and our reserve base holds tremendous value.","We are where the growth is, from San Diego to the Bay Area. In L.A. for example, we've added additional high-quality reserves in a huge market where reserves are lacking. In the Central Valley, we have permitted a major new quarry North of Fresno that will serve a reason of state that is expected to see the fastest growth over the next decade.","In the Bay Area and Napa where private construction is strong and public construction is on the uptick we've not only added reserves, we\u2019ve also increased our footprint and our product offerings through Shamrock. We are also the large supplier of asphalt in the state. You can see why we're excited about our future in California.","Our Texas operations after a tough year should benefit from improved DLT lettings and more normalized weather patterns in Houston and other coastal areas. We're continuing to invest in our Texas market positions, including a major investment in a strategic rail serve quarry, which will serve Houston and other markets destined grow for years to come. The recently announced federal budget deal should benefit our Virginia and Mid-Atlantic business with this exposure to defense and overall federal government spending.","Summing up, even with the challenge of 2017 many things happened during the year that bodes well for our future. Our world-class state performance leads the way for world-class operational in sales performance. Backlogs of work continue to build as the demand environment keeps improving. Public infrastructure began to kick in on top of the healthy private growth we were already seeing in key markets.","California, Tennessee and South Carolina passed major new highway bills. We completed strategic large acquisitions and bolt-ons, permitted new greenfield sites and began construction on new operations to better serve our customers.","Altogether, these give us even more strength and reach in strategic markets across our footprint. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and well-positioned to reap the benefits of all the good things accomplished in 2017. We are looking at an exciting future of volume growth, pricing strength operational excellence and margin expansion. Our people are eager to make the most of the promising year ahead of us.","And now I'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take your first question from Rohit Seth from SunTrust.","Rohit Seth","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you can help me reconcile your public volume growth expectation with the strength in contract awards, and then just on the cost angle on your guidance, there\u2019s\u2026","Tom Hill","\u2026highways, we would expect mid-single digit\u2026","Rohit Seth","I am sorry?","Tom Hill","On highways, I think we expect mid-single-digit, we feel really comfortable with that and really because we\u2019ve seen I\u2019d say nine or ten large projects around the country kickoff that we thought were going to kick off in '17.","In that -- that would just be the beginning of a ramp up and how we're spending as all these states mature, their DOTs to be able to facilitate that spending in the jobs, and as new money comes onboard.","On the other infrastructure I think we call it flat to low single-digit. There's a lot of funding there, but the capital projects just haven't really kicked in yet.","Rohit Seth","Got you. And then just on the cost angle, where there's a number of one-time costs that were identified in 2017. Just curious how much of that you anticipate to be non-recurring in 2018 in the guidance?","Tom Hill","John, why don\u2019t you answer kind of what happened with the cost in 2017 and then I'll talk about plans.","John McPherson","I'll start. A quarter of the $20 million or so, Rohit, that we called out just to give you a feel for it, negative kind of product margin and pricing mix was about $5 million of that 20 that's largely related to patterns of shipments and mix of work around Houston and coastal areas in the southern Gulf Coast, a lot of that\u2019s storm related, but don't expect that to repeat in the same way.","Diesel was about a $4 million headwind in the quarter. Diesel cost may continue to rise, but that will really get passed through in price over time and ultimately is a good thing for our business long term. So, don't see the margin impact repeating in the same way, it\u2019s really a timing issue.","Some certain expenses tied to acquisitions we made in the year where we need to put some money in those operations. Again, don\u2019t see that repeating, and that was about $3 million and then we had a number of transportation distribution related expenses that again don\u2019t necessarily see repeating in the same way, that was about $8 million in total.","Some of that is new ship transition, they're working through this year, some of that is barge inefficiencies that we should be able to work through. There were storm related, and then finally there was about $5 million of increased liability accruals related to some of our truck transportation activities, and again wouldn't see those recurring in the same way.","So, to your question on guidance, for our Aggregates segment next year, our guidance would imply and I think we called this out double digit growth in unit margins in our Aggregates segment. Some of that is cost recovery. But I tell you it's really in line with stuff we've done before, we\u2019ve done earlier in the recovery. If you were to look at the incrementals and kind of takeout Agg USA which distorts the incremental incrementals a little bit you'd see they're higher than the 60%. That reflects on a same-store basis, that reflects some cost recovery. But I think it's fair to say, our guidance and certainly the midpoint of our guidance doesn't reflect complete cost recovery of all the items we faced in 2017.","Tom Hill","Yeah, I would add to that the diesel cost and the distribution cost while they\u2019re out there -- they're a strategic advantage to us and that we\u2019ll get them back in time with price but it widens our economic moat around our facilities.","The other cost that John mentioned, they're real. I mean we experienced some that we had a tough time with weather and storms and things like that but those are unusual and timing issues are not trend issues, and our ability to convert incremental revenues to incremental gross profit hadn\u2019t changed.","But I do think that it did give us an opportunity internally to take those special cost and say, hey, look we got to be tough. We got comp over them any way and we've got our folks really focused on improving the operating efficiencies in spite of the one-time cost we saw and I would tell you they've done a nice job with that over the last few months in three ways.","I think they really roll up their sleeves and addressed some problem plants that we have. I think we put the right talent in some of the most challenged areas. And I think our entire team has been acutely focused on improving throughput and downtime.","Now, look, our people will deliver on this. I have confidence in that. They\u2019ll always do and they will also execute on our, the discipline of continuous improvement of margins that you've seen us do year-after-year. So, going into 2018, I think from an operating perspective, got a good plan and we're executing.","Rohit Seth","Fantastic. The distribution cost you mentioned, is that internal distribution cost between your plants, your quarries and your yards or is that they are [both] [ph]?","Tom Hill","Yeah. I think, it's a big chunk of that is, well, first of all, it's both. I would call out that the storm impact on the coast in Houston, specifically wouldn't allow us to fully load our ships to deliver, which is very expensive. There were a lot of problems on the Mississippi that were very expensive to us. So again, the one-time cost will get passed and the cost of diesel in that is a strategic advantage.","Rohit Seth","Got you. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. Just a follow-up on the guidance and pulling the string a little bit more. Implied in your EBITDA guidance for the year it is helpful outlining Aggregates USA, but could you also outline what was implied in terms of bolt-on acquisition contribution, and also certain storm related costs that would not be recurring assuming you have a normal year?","Tom Hill","I\u2019ll start, Kathryn, on bolt-on it's a little bit difficult to separate out perfectly some of those bolt-ons from the rest of the core business because they are kind of integrated within that, whether that's in the Bay Area or Nashville that you're very really familiar with.","But to give you a rough number, I price a $20 million to $30 million, but take that as a rough number Kathryn because again it's a little bit hard to separate out from the rest of the core operation given that there's a pretty tightly integrated and the way we run those markets.","I would say we're excited about those acquisitions and have great returns, they're performing well and show that we can deploy capital in some markets and downstream businesses in a smart way.","On storm related costs, we wouldn't expect to repeat. Again, if you look at the quarter for example this $8 million of distribution related costs we really would not expect to repeat. We've got some work to do, our ships will be delivered in the second quarter or third quarter, that will drag on a little bit. We'll have some costs, we're still working through in the first quarter maybe a little bit into the second.","And then when you look at diesel we see it trending up a little bit further in 2018, but again that's a timing issue, we expect to pass that through in pricing; it does happen with a lag as you know. But all this is you know very well it expands the economic mode around quarries and is actually net a positive thing for pricing and margins. Just a question of timing.","So, I hope that answers your question a little bit, Kathryn. Again, I think it's fair to say that while our guidance and our outlook and our internal plans imply a return to the kind of flow-throughs and improved unit margins you've seen us deliver before, they don't necessarily imply full catch up on every headwind we faced in 2017.","Kathryn Thompson","Yeah. And just as an estimate once again knowing that this is a little bit, it's art and science past combined, would it be fair to say that the storm-related cost would be closer to a range perhaps similar to the bolt-on acquisitions? So maybe may be something in the \u2013 even in the 30-ish \u2013 $30 million type number that was a real impact to your 2017-only result results?","Tom Hill","Yeah. Again recognizing, let's call it, there's some art in that, right, as you said. From my point of view, I don't think that's necessarily way off. And let me call it margin not just cost because the storms that impacted our Gulf Coast business so much and Kathryn you know this, it really impacted some of the most profitable aspects of our business. Particularly given the advantages that we have and shipping for Mexico and our service to that broad region.","So, we really saw at a little bit at sales and in pricing and in sales mix and in distribution cost and in operating cost throughout a very profitable portion of our business. So, I don't think you're far off but I think it's a little easier to think of as margin impact as opposed to only cost impact because it hits \u2013 hit the business in a pretty broad way.","John McPherson","Yeah, I would add to that that, that if you look at our plan, you see us returning to that double-digit margin growth that John mentioned and much higher flow through. So, while diesel is going to be a headwind for a little while, so will distribution, actually that will end up being advantage to us as we catch up with that. So, I think feel very good about plan.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. And just a clean-up question on the \u2013 on kind of the cost side is with the two big shifts that you're transitioning, you recognized the cost of those ships last year, but now you're transitioning now. Where do we currently stand in terms of when they will be fully operational, is it roughly coming online excluding weather impact?","Tom Hill","We would expect one in the second quarter and one in the third quarter at this point.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. And moving over to California, we had a chance to spend some time in Southern California market earlier this year. And we certainly can appreciate the tightness and supply of Aggregates in that market, but perhaps could you explore a little bit more about the rail advantage in the Southern California market and your view of the private construction market since you spent a bit of time on the public side? Thank you.","Tom Hill","Yeah. I would just -- I\u2019ll give you a couple of comments on California, first of all, the California is really healthy going into 2018, it's a market that we're really excited about for not just 2018, but 2019, 2020 and beyond. The private market continues to grow \u2013 residential is very healthy both in North and Southern California, non-res is solid, highways were actually coming off a low in 2017.","And I think the state's going to regain its footing in 2018. We see big growth as you know and highways going into really into 2019, but really in to 2020. Our backlogs are improving on the highway side and actually, the infrastructure we're starting to see a little bit of growth on that how we have structured.","It is a very, very constructive pricing environment in California. And that's really through our products, our customers\u2019 products and the construction side of it. Demand for asphalt is growing and now we'll have to raise prices fairly quickly to get over a rapidly rising liquid costs, I think, and with all this, we're very happy with our acquisition in Northern California with Shamrock, and we're starting up a new quarry in Fresno, which is a big, big demand market for us, and these some we've been working on for 10 years. So, you can see why we're excited about California.","Kathryn Thompson","And given that the rail network is somewhat limited in Southern California, how much do you think that is an advantage for you or is that not necessarily \u2013 maybe help us frame that?","Tom Hill","No. I'm sorry, I missed up part of the question. Rail movements in California are very difficult. Our position, we have the best reserve position in the largest markets for truck and as people run out of reserves in the truck market of L.A. and San Francisco, and San Diego, we're going to have to move out rail in. It will give us a marked advantage over the next few years.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will move next to Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","Hi. Thank you. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more context around the synergies from Aggregates, let\u2019s say, how much of the $50 million of EBITDA contribution 2018 does include synergies and how should we think about the ramp, the amounts and the timing over the next 12 months to 24 months?","John McPherson","Hey, Garik I'll start to suggest about synergies discussion and Tom could comment. The $50 million for this year has relatively little what we call synergy in it. There\u2019s some overhead synergy will capture, little bit of cost synergy will capture, but a lot of this synergy we would say is yet to come.","So, I think of that $50 million as a number we'd expect to be meaningfully higher in 2018 I'm sorry in 2019. And we're very pleased with the acquisition. You can tell just looking at a map that it fits very well with their business and this is one that's got a very broad set of synergies, they range from things that are operational to things that are logistically oriented reaching rail car utilization to things that are very commercially oriented, reaching new customers with a different level of service with a full mix of products, and as such they're very attractive synergies.","I would say, a pretty good number over time. But it\u2019ll take 18 to 24 months to fully capture them. So, to answer your question that $50 million is didn\u2019t have a lot of synergy in it.","Tom Hill","Yeah, I would add to that, that this acquisition as you know really expands our footprint and \u2013 and \u2013 and South and East Georgia a little bit in South Carolina, it really expands our service offering into Florida, given it\u2019s granted for asphalt in Florida, it provides optionality of how we service our legacy rail yards and how we service the Agg USA railyards for both our existing quarries and once that requires a lot of optionality, that both in product quality how we optimize production and sale splits.","So, this as John said, we\u2019ll recognize those synergies really over the next 12 to 24 months. I think we\u2019re very pleased with how the integration has gone. Well run businesses which this was -- have really talented people and we -- they\u2019ve come on board, Vulcan making an positive impact immediately.","And so that\u2019s all going well as you know we talk a lot about the assets, but these are some really talented folks that we \u2013 that we came with this, so we\u2019re pleased to welcome in our family. All of this complements our existing footprint and the new Ag USA markets, and you've got to remember this is -- this is of two of our fastest growing markets of Georgia and Florida. So far, it's going really well.","Garik Shmois","Okay, thank you. I wanted to shift over to just the comments on Illinois, Houston, they've been you know, softer markets for you in 2017 for two different reasons; that how you expect those two markets to play out in 2018? It sounds like Houston you\u2019re poised for recovery, but any more granularity will be appreciated?","Tom Hill","Yeah, I would call those very different. I think that Illinois is going to continue to struggle. I think the team in Illinois, well, in the face of really tough circumstances from the abandoned market, had been a really good job of executing to the best of their ability and their disciplines both on operations and their efforts on sales, and getting all, they can at what \u2013 what they've been offered. So tough -- just tough duty in Illinois with -- really with public spending.","Houston I would tell you we're I think we've \u2013 we've made the turn it is you know been a tough place on top of tough economics just as we \u2013 we\u2019re starting to come out of the sink in Houston we got slammed with hurricanes and storms, and just hurt everybody down there. But all-in-all, I think Houston is going to be fine.","The highway demand in overall in Texas is very good, Houston including, res is starting from a really low base in Houston, but starting to pick up. Non-res in Houston we see is picking up also.","From a pricing perspective all of Texas has held the climate. We had tough times with that \u2013 with Houston because as we talked a lot about the storm impact but I would tell you that I would expect to see price increases in Houston than actually in most of Texas in April. So, where it's- one, Illinois is going to continue to be tough, I think Houston has made the turn and will see a much better 2018.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thank you. And then just last question just on the step-up in growth CapEx for the year assuming the Fresno project is included in that $350 million increase. Just wondering, John if you could provide some context around the payback and when we should start to see some of the volumes or when these projects should ramp up and start to be accretive to earnings?","And I guess I'm wondering if this step-up in growth CapEx while we\u2019re not talking about 2019 just yet should we expect to see maybe an elevated run rate in growth CapEx for the foreseeable future?","John McPherson","Yeah. I'll put it in the context of free cash flow for a second, Garik, that's okay, just to think about it in total. So, I just \u2013 I'd point out that our operating and maintenance CapEx is actually going to take a step down from about $300 million this year a little bit less than $300 million to about $250 million next year.","That's not because of the growth side, it's just because we've been investing pretty heavily in our physical plant for the last two or three years. And so that's just our need, $250 million. So, our need for cooperating maintenance is CapEx is a bit lower in 2018 than it was in 2017. So that's one.","Two, I would think of the growth capital as you know if it was M&A, we wouldn't be talking about it until it's finished, if we were just buying these quarries, instead of building these quarries.","So, I would think a good chunk of that $350 million as if it were a transaction we were closing at the end of 2018. And some of that result you really won't see until 2019 because we're really building out some new quarries and that takes time.","Now, I would underscore what Tom said as these new quarry developments have been some cases 10 plus years in the making. They're just coming to fruition now to your point of return, it's a very good time to do these things. The timing made sense for us when we look at our hand in Texas, look at our hand in California, and there are some other developments, new distribution points in places like Charleston. The market is such and the margins are such that the returns are attractive, and now is the right time to fully develop.","So, excited about it, we're confident in it. In today's world those returns compare favorably to your average run-of-the-mill M&A returns. I don't expect that you will see necessarily the same level of elevated internal growth at CapEx moving forward Garik.","Again, to a degree this is the timing of when these particular new quarry developments were coming to fruition. So, maybe elevated a little bit in 2019, I'm not saying over the $350 million there is more to do, but not elevated in any permanent sense.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thank you. And best of luck.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Phil Ng from Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Hey, guys. The mid-single-digit price increase you guys have guided to. Is that the spice to offset inflation you're seeing? And when do you expect to kind of catch up on the diesel side and just given the backdrop where demand is, is there an opening to get a little more upside on the pricing side of things?","Tom Hill","If you go into 2018 from what we see, we actually see the pricing climate improving. And one thing I do know is our philosophy on pricing that we've executed over the last five years has not changed, put some color on 2018 for you, we would expect pricing to build throughout the year for the two normal reasons that we talk about we want different markets, we\u2019ll have different timing for fixed plant price increases, we'll see some \u2013 and we've seen some in January, we\u2019ll actually see some and in February, we'll see some in April and you'll see some in mid-year.","And then the second reason is remember bid work which we are doing everyday all day is a long steady campaign and will build throughout the year. I would tell you that the pricing discussions that we've had with customers in the fourth quarter in January have been very good.","Their confidence in the market is as good as not better than ours, they see its improving. They can see visibility, the continued visibility on the private side, what you\u2019re going to really see is its reinforced now by the public side in the DOTs.","If I were to highlight a few areas, it would be \u2013 then you would be surprised whether it\u2019d be down the coast Virginia through the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia will be strong, Tennessee will be good, as I talked about earlier, I think we'll think that Texas in April will start kicking in and California would be really high on our list. So, our pricing discipline continue to be successful.","If you look back five years, our prices have gone up 25% and from \u2013 with the public side kicking in the environments only stronger and I have confidence we\u2019ll execute on our pricing plans in the different markets.","Phil Ng","Okay.","Tom Hill","And I think you mentioned inflation, you mentioned inflation, there is a couple of quick comments, I'd encourage you to just kind of keep in mind that our Aggregates centric business doesn't have the same kind of inflationary exposure that people might be worried about with other industrials.","Keeping my way on our main input the quarries, the rock think about the long-term pricing history of the industry, think about pricing climate that's actually improving, and where things like diesel cost rise has actually improved the pricing climate and the competitive dynamics at a local level because they expand the economic motor under quarry. Yes, there's a set of timing issues around that but we don't \u2013 as I say, inflation is not a big concern to us right now. Let's put it that way.","Phil Ng","Okay. That's helpful. And I think that, John you might have teased this in your prepared remarks about appreciating the cadence of 1Q just because seasonally it's been one the last two years. How should we think about the EBITDA contribution over the quarters throughout the year and then some of the incremental dynamics as well just because you had some one-offs last year that should reverse in the back half?","John McPherson","Yeah. Yeah, I think this is an important point. We just want to remind people, it's not a surprise but there's nothing new here just a reminder that Q1 has been stronger on the volume side for the last two or three years in total. And there\u2019s been a higher proportion of annual volumes and that would typically be if you look at longer term seasonality patterns.","So certainly, the comps, if you will, are harder in Q1 and should get easier in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. Those from a volume side and from a cost side, and as Tom said, we'd expect some pricing to be building throughout the year just given the normal cadence and in the way, it works in the Aggregates business.","I don't want to give you kind of a spread of the EBITDA throughout the year because it's very difficult and particularly in Q1 a lot of it comes down to a couple weeks in March. I almost just think it could be misleading, but I do think it's worth calling out Q1 to more difficult comp just given the patterns over the last few years and then certainly, the comps got a bit easier through the rest of the year.","Phil Ng","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And just one last one for me. Just based on some of the timing of these state level initiatives which is obviously, quite positive and as stats kicks in, is this low single-digit growth on public spending a good way to think about the growth trajectory in 1920 or could we see some acceleration? Thanks.","Tom Hill","I think, first of all, I would call that mid-single digit growth in highways be on \u2013 they will build and we talk a lot about this. There will be a layering effect both within states as they bring work on and as the DOTs mature to be able handle work. They're not just going wait to finish one job where they start another one and then, on top of with interstate, you'll see state-on-state bills.","So, places like Texas or Florida or North Carolina where the money is already mature and they're spinning it and then they are shipping it, you're going to see Georgia layer on top of that. After two years, they're starting their jobs and then, you'll follow up with California -- in a couple of years you'll follow up with California, Tennessee, and South Carolina which will also start to ramp up and layer on top of it. So, while it's \u2013 highway is mid-single-digit this year, I would expect it to ramp up in 2019, 2020, 2021 roughly for the next five years.","Phil Ng","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","We'll move next to Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. On the Shamrock acquisition, can you talk a little about your experience with that asset thus far and then, also kind of specifically your outlook for the Bay Area?","Tom Hill","Yeah, so, well, first of all I would tell you must like my comments about Ag USA, that was a very well \u2013 very well-run business. And the management team that we got with Shamrock is very talented, and it's been a really good marriage with our folks and how much and how they've integrated so quickly not just the business, but also the management teams. So, we're thrilled that they're on board with us.","That acquisition has performed both the aggregate distribution and Ramus Concrete have performed superior to our original plan. It is integrated very, very well. We see good growth in that area on the private side as we talked about both res and non-res, highways not so much probably for another couple of years, but it's -- so the market has performed very well.","We expect it to continue to perform very well and actually kick in even more in a couple of years when the public side starts up. But you know I'm very proud of the team in California and in the Shamrock team.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Thanks for that. And then lastly, what are your high-level thoughts on industry M&A this year? Do you think it could be as active as it was last year?","Tom Hill","It is active, and we've got M&A going on. You know, we\u2019re always working on those things. You know I go back to for all this it's about discipline and we say this all the time, but it's about what are you going to buy and what market you\u2019re going to buy it in. Does it fit us?","So what synergies are unique to us, and how we \u2013 and then what are you going to pay for it, and you know don't overpay. And then once you get it, you really got to work hard to integrate it and get it tucked in as fast as possible.","John McPherson","One thing we point out that we talked about internally, it's possible that tax reform having passed and is being done and behind this is, you\u2019re not going to shake some things loose, if you will, in terms of opportunities set. But at the same time, it really raises our need for discipline, because if you're not really careful the benefits of lower taxes just get very competed away in the M&A market.","So, you've got to really, really be extra disciplined. You know we talk here about lower taxes can make a really good deal, a great deal, but they don't make a bad deal or good deal. So, we think a lot about that.","I would say it's a little bit different on taxes in our core business and some might ask about inflation, so I just want to mention this, but you know our after-tax cash flow in 2018 we think is about a $100 million higher than it would have been under the previous tax regime.","And given the nature of Aggregates focused business and the pricing dynamics over time and the focus on the returns on capital, difficulty of new entry we\u2019d actually don\u2019t expect that to get completed way in our industry, you know not at all.","So, internally but lot more excess cash we have and the M&A environment we need to be if anything disciplined.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Great color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Tom Hill","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning, guys. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about on the organic quarry development, how much reserves are you adding or how much of your reserve position will become effectively addressable as a result of the investments?","And can you talk about over what timeframe do you expect capacity utilization in the new facilities to ramp up towards the levels in the new facilities to ramp up towards the levels you see across your existing footprint.","Tom Hill","Kind of combined because I won't call out individuals. I'd tell you it's over 300 million tons. And I would expect those projects to take 18, 24 months before we're operating them. Now, remember these are markets that we\u2019re already in, it\u2019s to build out our hand. And but it's going to take some time not only to start and remember these are both serving big, big growth markets.","And there too \u2013 the design of this is to make \u2013 is to grow into that demand and to capture that demand which other folks would, can't capture. It's just not, the capacity is not there.","So as John mentioned, both of these projects the one in Texas and California have taken over a decade and it just takes that much time I think our folks have done a great job working with the local communities to make sure we got those permits and have permission to operate. And we'll build them out and tuck them in like we would an acquisition, integrate them into the rest of our network.","Jerry Revich","Okay. That's helpful. And then on Aggregates USA on prior transactions that you folks have targeted, synergies equivalent to 25% to 50% of standalone, EBITDA I'm wondering if you can comment on how you see Aggregates USA is stacking up relative to that historical target you folks have had?","John McPherson","Jerry, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll repeat things we've already said about Aggregates USA. I think \u2013 but I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number just because I don't want to confuse guidance which is the $50 million this year.","Very broad range of synergies, and what we kept probably toward the higher end of synergy mix of deals we've done. But because of the breadth of this synergies and the nature of those synergies being not just overhead, not just operational costs improvement, not just logistics, not just commercial opportunities, but all of those. I think it will take a little bit longer to capture. But certainly, very exciting and as you can imagine, we're happy with that deployment of capital.","Tom Hill","Yeah, I would add if you just look at the slide, the map that shows the overlay of our existing operations and new rail network in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and then what we overlay with them it is this is \u2013 this one that has rich with synergies just because you can mix and match so easily, both what quarries we shift from in to their railyards and vice versa, and how you match all that up, how you marry those markets because we had some gaps and they filled in the gaps for us, and the new product offering into Florida.","So, as John said, this is one that is particularly rich with synergies and that, that will take some time to mature, and our \u2013 but our folks are all over it and working on it. And as I said earlier, the team we got is not stagnant. They understand how to put all that together and so it's been \u2013 it's been a fun integration to watch them succeed and that it will be fun to watch over the next year or 18 months.","John McPherson","Jerry we may also you've looked at this I know as have others but it's also just really well positioned against some of the specific things like the Georgia DLT plans to do, which will be happening over a period of years, where that\u2019s intermodal project developments have rose out of making et cetera, et cetera.","So, it's really good positioning. And that's not an 2018 issue or even a 2019 issue, but it's a really attractive aspect of the transaction and not \u2013 I'd say not accidental.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then lastly slide 6 is a helpful layout. So obviously the past two years have been pretty tough for everybody. When you folks say that first quarter faces tough comps, are you trying to condition the market to year-over-year volume decline in the first quarter, and I guess the reason behind the question is it feels like the backlog on the highway side has been building for about a year-and-a-half. And so, if the first quarter is indeed down for the industry I guess how do we get conviction that it to reaccelerate in the construction season?","Tom Hill","Let me be clear, the demand is there. As you saw in the fourth quarter, where our volumes were down a little bit in October, the sun came out, it was dry and November-December and we had double-digit volume growth. So, the demand is there. That is a combination of core demand on the private side, it is the new DOT work kicking in. There's some delayed work there. So, it's a combination.","So, as you look at the first quarter let's be real clear about this, the demand is there. This is about being \u2013 this is about days to ship in the first quarter which is always dicey. If you look back at 2016 and particularly 2016 and then again not quite as good in 2017, we had a very good first quarter weather.","So, when we talk about comps as we always say the first quarter is always dicey because you don't know if it's going to be 60 degrees or 22 degrees. Is it going to be snowing or is it going to be sunshine and so? But the underlying demand is there and I think November and December is really good evidence of that.","John McPherson","Just to pick up and that will be clear we're not trying to suggest specifically that volume in the first quarter will be lower than the prior year. We're simply trying to remind everyone that it is a tougher comp, but it would be inappropriate for us to try and even give any kind of specific Q1 guidance just because it's so dependent on whether in March, anyway. So, it's both a tough \u2013 tougher comp and more uncertain. I take Tom's points as the key things which is the work is there to be done.","Jerry Revich","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Tom Hill","Sure.","Operator","We'll hear next from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.","Tom Hill","Good morning.","Stanley Elliott","Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Quick question with all the moving parts and as we\u2019re thinking about double digit unit margin growth for the year.","Is it fair to assume that the incrementals in the first half of the year are going to be maybe a little bit softer and we're looking at a big ramp in the second half of the year in terms of allowing price to catch up allowing some of the easier comparisons? I hate to kind of get to that level of granularity, but it's just kind of a different set up than we've had in the past?","Tom Hill","I'll start and I'm sure John will have some to add this, but as we said and we talked about pricing that it would it would accelerate through the year for the normal reasons of timing of pricing in different markets and then the pricing as a campaign particularly with bid work. So, we would expect normally for price to go build the year.","Again, the comps in the first quarter are going to be tougher, they get a little easier with what we saw in wet weather in the second and third. I think that when it comes to operations and discipline, I think we're \u2013 we're kicking in and that will also improve obviously that improves with weather also. I mean it\u2019s easier to operate in in June and July and August than it is in January and February particularly if you're in some place like Illinois or Virginia.","So, for those reasons and I don't think anything is out of the ordinary there. And we've mentioned what \u2013 the first quarter stuff, that's how we would see the year shaping up. I don't have a whole lot to add to that other than to just keep in mind we're \u2013 as an industry coming out of a period of sluggish shimmer growth into -- into a sustained period of returning to growth.","And with that shift, I think you're going to see some normal tick up of pricing and kind of build throughout the year. You\u2019re going to see a little bit better operating leverage throughout the year. So, I think it's really kind of as you'd expect probably.","Stanley Elliott","Yeah. That\u2019s fair. And then with the change in the tax code and kind of the \u2013 the new improved free cash flow for you all, does it change how you think about debt levels near-term for -- should an acquisition pop up or anything along those lines, just given this kind of a more of a structural change to the -- to the operations.","Tom Hill","I think the short answer is, no. And that we are sustaining commitment to investment grade. We need the way the agencies work, we need to keep an eye on debt to total EBITDA, but I also then would say that from an overall financial value and flexibility point of view it does give us more flexibility and it just gives us more of our own operating cash flow from which to fund investments.","Adding a $100 million of cash flow is not an insignificant thing. And in the 2018 year, we're going to get another $170 million of cash from tax refunds and tax rebates that are also tied to tax reform. It's a one-time thing, but it's \u2013 it\u2019s more than a $1 a share, it\u2019s not an insignificant amount of money.","So, it certainly gives us more flexibility. It certainly makes us more valuable It certainly makes the transactions like Aggregates USA that we did under the assumption of a higher tax rate much more valuable. But it does not change our core priorities or our position on the balance sheet or our view that what we want to do is maintain flexibility through all parts of the cycle. So, it really doesn't change our priorities or our policies. It just gives us much stronger free cash flow profile.","Stanley Elliott","Yep. Yeah. Understood. Thanks, guys and best of luck.","Tom Hill","Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Hill for any additional or concluding remarks.","Tom Hill","Well, thank you all of you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to what is shaping up to be a very exciting 2018 and we look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference.

Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Operator","Good morning. My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vulcan Materials 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hill. Mr. Hill, you may begin your conference.","James Thomas Hill","Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2014 results. I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. We are very pleased with our third quarter results detailed in the press release. We're happy to provide additional color today and spend some time answering your questions.","A slide presentation will accompany this webcast and be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.","Before we begin with the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","Now turning to Slide 3. We are pleased with our third quarter results and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues in the growth in earnings. Revenues increased 7%, driven mostly by a 12% increase in aggregates shipments. Excluding revenues in the prior year associated with our divested concrete and cement businesses in Florida, revenues increased 15%. Our earnings leverage on higher revenues continues to be excellent. Gross profits and EBIT increased sharply, up 31% and 57%, respectively, due largely to strong earnings leverage in our aggregates business and flat SAG costs. On a comparable basis, earnings from continuing operations increased 93% to $0.54 per diluted share.","Turning to Slide 4. Our third quarter results continue a trend starting in recent quarters, as shown in this table of trailing 12-month key figures. Over the past 12 months, aggregates shipments have increased 9% or $13 million tons, still well below normalized demand levels. During this time, we've leveraged a 9% growth in volumes into a 38% increase in gross profit and a more than 130% increase in EBIT. We believe we are in the early innings of demand recovery. As we continue to execute our sales and operating plans, we remain very focused on continuing the margin expansion you've seen us deliver in recent quarters.","Slide 5 illustrates the volume growth in the quarter. The map depicts the 20 states we currently serve. You can see the geographic breadth of the year-over-year volume growth across our markets. Third quarter shipments grew 12% in total, and 10.5% on a same-store basis. Shipments in Illinois and Texas were up 31% and 21%, respectively, due in part to large project work. Other markets, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia reported volume growth between 10% and 15%. This strong broad-based growth is driven by improving private construction activity and our ability to serve growing demand for large project work in both private and public end markets, particularly large industrial projects along the Gulf Coast. Residential construction activity continues to be solid across our footprint. New lot development is increasing. While the growth rate nationally for housing starts has slowed in recent months, many of our key markets in Georgia, Texas, California and Florida continue to post above-average growth rates. Private nonresidential demand in our markets continues to grow faster than in the rest of the U.S. This is driven by office, commercial and manufacturing projects, and by significant growth in construction activity along the Gulf Coast. We are uniquely positioned to serve petrochemical plant expansions and other energy-related major projects.","In the public sector, shipments for highways remains strong due to strong contract awards in 2013, increases in state highway funding and TIFIA-funded projects in key states. Additionally, the extension of the federal highway funding through May 2015 has provided more funding certainty to state departments of transportation. Given the strength of our strategic positions and our sales execution, we expect to keep outpacing the rate of volume growth of the industry overall. Our markets, despite recently reported double-digit shipment increases, remain far below normal levels of demand.","Now let me focus on our success in converting these early gains and demand into expanding margins and profits. To cut straight to the headline, you'll see on the right-hand side of Slide 6 our gross profit per ton has increased $0.43 or 12%. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.15, a 7% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing a great job of leveraging demand growth into even higher levels of profitability.","So how have we done this? It's important to remember that our improving profitability in aggregates isn't driven by average selling price increases alone. At Vulcan, we commonly think of 3 major profit drivers that must be managed in combination. These are depicted on the left-hand side of Slide 6. First, price for service. Are we receiving full and fair value for the quality of the products and services we provide, are we helping our customers be successful, and are we getting paid appropriately for that help? Second, operating efficiency and leverage. Are we managing costs tightly every day, and are we using our assets and capital as well as we can? Third, sales and production mix. Are we producing what we can sell and selling what we produce? Are we managing inventories responsibly, and are we converting each ton that we crush into cash in a reasonable amount of time? We manage these factors locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly.","This quarter's results, again, demonstrate the high quality of work being done by our local teams and our -- and their support groups. Despite a modest 2%, or $0.23, gain in average selling price, our gross profit per ton increased 12%, or $0.43. As I will touch on in a minute, the rate of growth in average selling prices will increase over future quarters. We already see clear evidence of that momentum. But in the early phase of the recovery, when price lags volume gains, it has been very important for us to grow unit margins faster than price.","Now this is not a new story for us. You can see on Slide 7 that we have, in fact, compounded unit profitability faster than pricing since quarterly volumes began growing in the second half of 2013. During the last 12 months, our average unit price has increased 2.7% or $0.29 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 20% or $0.52 per ton. While I'm pleased with our performance, let me be clear, we're not hitting on all cylinders yet. There's a lot more margin out there. I'll refer back to the 3 profit drivers noted on the prior slide. On price for service. The expanding margins that we have delivered so far don't reflect the high- to mid-single digit price gains normally associated with cyclical recoveries. These should take hold in 2015.","On operating efficiencies and leverage. While our plant managers and their teams have done an excellent job controlling costs, the fact remains that we are operating a capital-intensive production business at 50% to 60% of its capacity. We are well positioned to further leverage fixed cost sales.","On sales and production mix. We've worked hard to maintain our core production planning and inventory disciplines throughout the downturn. As recovery continues, and as we see a larger portion of new construction activity, we will sell the entire product mix at full value. As we move forward into the recovery, we'll continue to manage and balance all 3 of these factors at the local level, and all 3 are improving. We're entering this upturn in demand with unit margins close to those that we enjoyed during our last peak, a time when we were producing and selling approximately 150 million more tons than we are today. We are confident in our ability to convert incremental shipments and revenues into expanding profit margins and returns on capital.","Because of our improving margins, we have been able to deliver very good earnings flow-through. Our expanding margins per ton have allowed us to deliver strong flow-through to gross profit of incremental freight-adjusted revenues in our aggregates business. Slide 8 shows our incremental margin performance thus far in the recovery. By incremental margins, I mean the change in segment gross profit in our aggregates business divided by the change in freight-adjusted revenues, with freight-adjusted revenues defined simply as average selling price multiplied by tons shipped. This metric reflects the total gross profit generated for each ton shipped without the margin distortions of our pass-through freight revenues.","To improve transparency for investors, we've adjusted our financial statement presentation. This should make it easier for you to compare our change in segment gross profit to our change in freight-adjusted revenues for a given period. For the third quarter, the incremental gross profit margin was 65%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of this year. Aggregates gross profit grew $39 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $60 million. As reported, and including acquisitions, the incremental margin was 58%, or $38 million of incremental gross profit on $66 million of incremental freight-adjusted revenues.","As we've mentioned previously, quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs. For that reason, we're also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. As you can see, for the trailing 12 months the incremental gross profit margin was also 65%, adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregate gross profit increased approximately $118 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $182 million. We have included a table in the appendix of our slide presentation which illustrates how we calculate incremental gross profit margins in our aggregates business. We believe this type of gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan and its shareholders as volumes continue to recover, particularly given our strategic focus on the aggregates business.","Slide 9 highlights some of the positive indicators we see in the marketplace. These contribute to our firm confidence in stronger price growth. This is demonstrated by the pricing momentum in key markets, where the construction recovery is farther along, and where we are already seeing robust price increases occurring twice a year in some cases. Aggregates volume and price have a lead-lag relationship. Price growth typically follows volume growth but with some delay. We are now coming into a more normalized pace in the cycle. We are also seeing a return of confidence for sustained recovery and that, coupled with continuing volume growth now for 6 consecutive quarters, will positively affect pricing power.","Finally, we're seeing upward and broad-based pricing trends across our entire geography. These firming prices across the sector include price increases in concrete and cement. Putting it all together, the pricing environment is rapidly improving across all of our markets. We have the makings for robust price growth on top of continuing volume growth and margin expansion.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John for some comments before taking your questions.","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll touch briefly on our nonaggregates businesses before turning to our full year outlook, and then a summary of our approach to capital allocation through the first 9 months of the year.","Starting with Slide 10, we'll present the results from our asphalt and concrete segments. Earning results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit improved $1 million due to higher margins and earnings from recently completed acquisitions. Asphalt volumes approximated the prior year but were short of expectations due to the delayed start of several large projects in California until 2015. Concrete gross profit was $5 million higher versus a loss of $4 million in the prior year's third quarter. Adjusting for the company's Florida concrete business sold in the first quarter of 2014, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $3 million. Collectively, reported gross profit for our nonaggregates segments improved $12 million over the prior year quarter.","Now turning to Slide 11 and our full year outlook. Our full year expectations for earnings growth and margin expansion remain basically in line with our plans, although we'll get there in a slightly different way. Aggregates volumes should come in a bit higher than our beginning-of-year expectations. And although our growth in average selling prices for aggregates has been modest, both our per ton margins and our incremental gross profit margins are in line with our internal goals. Our execution in this regard has been very strong, as Tom mentioned.","As just highlighted, our gross profits from our nonaggregates segments had been at the low end of our beginning-of-year expectations, due in large part to delays of certain jobs into 2015. As a result, our overall external guidance for full year 2014 remains largely unchanged from August when we discussed our second quarter results. And as we often note, fourth quarter results can be significantly impacted by weather, particularly as we get late into the quarter.","Now before I hit the highlights of our full year 2014 outlook in a bit more detail, I'd like to just reiterate and emphasize our view that the business has excellent momentum heading into 2015. The recovery toward more normal levels of demand for our products has a long way to go, but we should be entering our sixth consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year growth in shipments. Our unit margins are strong and improving but are yet to benefit from the accelerating gains in average selling prices that many expect over the coming quarters. And importantly, we have the organizational and financial strength required to invest smartly in growth at this point in the cycle.","I'll now walk through Slide 11 for a brief summary of our updated full year outlook. For reasons of comparison, the format of this slide is the same as we've used in prior calls. I'll be brief, as we have, of course, touched on most of these items in our press release as well as earlier in this call.","Since February, we have increased our outlook for aggregates volume to reflect stronger demand growth. That stronger demand, combined with strong sales execution, has resulted in our same-store aggregates volumes increasing 9% year-to-date. Assuming normal weather patterns, we expect volume growth in the fourth quarter of this year to increase mid- to high-single digits relative to last year's strong quarter when weather was unseasonably mild.","For aggregates pricing, we expect full year pricing to be near the low end of our guidance range of 3% to 5%, with recent pricing actions having more impact on pricing in 2015 as opposed to the fourth quarter of 2014.","For our nonaggregates businesses, we've narrowed our gross profit forecast from prior guidance of $40 million to $50 million to the current guidance of $40 million to $45 million, again, largely due to the delay of certain asphalt paving projects into 2015.","SAG, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs, should remain in line with the prior year. We, of course, remain focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover. Our interest expense forecast remains unchanged at $165 million to $170 million for the full year. This excludes onetime charges associated with our tender offer completed earlier. And finally, our capital spending outlook remains unchanged at $240 million. That to support improving demand as we look to 2015 and 2016.","I'll conclude now with Slide 12 before handing the call back to Tom. On September 30, we announced that we had completed 6 acquisitions during the third quarter. You see these highlighted on the slide. Because cap allocation is an important area of focus for our management team at Vulcan, I'd like to take just a minute to place those transactions in the context of our overall approach to that topic so far this year.","As noted in our release, Vulcan has generated approximately $890 million in cash year-to-date from operations and asset sales. Approximately $719 million of that cash is associated with the sale of our Florida area cement and concrete operations, the most volatile and capital-intensive components of our portfolio, to Argos. As a reminder, that transaction included a 20-year aggregates supply agreement. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were, and we believe that transaction has been and will continue to be a positive strategic move for both parties.","Now moving to the balance sheet for a moment. Year-to-date, we've paid down $516 million of debt. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA has improved approximately 3.6 versus a measure of 5.9 a year ago. Our overall credit outlook is solid and improving. These moves and the other actions we've taken to improve our core profitability put us in an excellent position to make the investments we made in the third quarter. We are well positioned both operationally and financially to grow our total profits and unit margins and, where the right opportunities present themselves, to grow our asset base.","Now touching briefly on our third quarter acquisitions. In total, we invested approximately $320 million in attractive markets with which we are well familiar, as you see, again, highlighted on Slide 12. Approximately $275 million of the investment was cash, with the balance being in stock. Collectively, the acquired operations shipped approximately 8 million tons of aggregates in the most recent year, a figure we expect to grow in 2015 and beyond. And these transactions added 450 million tons of reserves to our portfolio. The integration of these operations has moved forward smoothly, a real credit to both our local teams and our shared support groups. The acquired operations will contribute incrementally to earnings in 2014, but should be accretive to EPS in 2015. As Tom has noted, our pipeline of potential bolt-on acquisitions remains very attractive. That said, we will remain disciplined in our approach to these investments, maintaining our focus on fundamentally attractive markets where we can establish a #1 or #2 position. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment. Tom?","James Thomas Hill","Thanks, John. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, and we're looking forward to the months ahead. We are very excited about the opportunities we see. Our recent acquisitions are already performing well. We're excited about the volume growth, pricing momentum and strong margin expansion we see across our markets. Our operations continue to run with great efficiency and are best-in-class in the industry. I thank our employees for their outstanding performance in these exciting times. I am very proud of our people, and our future looks great. And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Tom or John, I was hoping you might be able to touch on 2015 in a little more detail. I know there wasn't kind of explicit guidance. The commentary was encouraging or is encouraging. One of your big competitors kind of laid out a framework. I was wondering if you might at least speak to kind of an agreement on that and that was one that kind of pointed towards infrastructure being up mid-singles in '15, private nonres being up in the high singles and residential being up in the double-digit range. And to the degree you're comfortable just giving us a broad framework, could you maybe start there?","James Thomas Hill","Yes, Ted. Right now, we're in the middle of the planning process for 2015. But let me give you a little bit of how we view it. We are continuing to see, as we stated earlier, lots of pricing momentum, demand continues to grow, our employees continue to give us great margin expansion. We continue to focus on those 3 profit drivers, sales and production mix, price for service and operating leverage and efficiency, and all 3 of those continue to improve each month.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, fair enough.","John R. McPherson","Ted, this is John. The only thing I think we'd add is we do -- we're not ready to give any explicit guidance, obviously, for next year, but we do continue to see all LNG segments up for '15 directionally. And I think, importantly, as Tom said in his comments, we believe our market will continue to grow faster than the industry as a whole. We like our geographic mix. They were more depressed than the market as a whole, and they're recovering faster than the industry as a whole.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. If I can ask a second, just I know at the end of your prepared remarks, you touched on the balance sheet, John, and I guess, exiting '13, we had you at about 5x leverage. On our numbers, you'll exit this year at about 2.5x, and exiting next year, we'd have you at about 2x debt-to-EBITDA. So a huge improvement and a lot of strength. Can you just talk about how you might redeploy that capital? And how you think about whether it's acquisitions or CapEx or buybacks or all the options, and kind of where you are at this point?","John R. McPherson","Sure. First, I'll just say the obvious, which is how we think about capital allocation, how we think about return of cash to shareholders, how we think about our capital structure, all really important topics in a business such as ours. We're always evaluating a variety of different options. I think given the strength of our asset base, we actually have many options. I think what you can count on us for is to have a plan, not just to swing from one latest idea to another. More to the point on your question, I think we're very comfortable with the strength of our credit position and the financial position right now. I think we have several good options for the redeployment of capital through time. Certainly, reinvestment of CapEx into our business to support growth, but also to support the margin expansion to which Tom referred. I think we continue to see a pipeline of potentially attractive bolt-on acquisitions of a nature similar to those that you saw us complete in the third quarter. Always more difficult to kind of predict how those will turn out, though. And I think you'll see us, over time, have a balanced approach to reinvesting in growth and returning cash to shareholders. Now the exact form and timing of that return of cash is to be decided later, but I think you'll hear us talk about a plan for that approach.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. To follow up on the capital deployment discussion, just wondering, are there any opportunities here going forward to set up on an MLP-type structure for a portion of your assets?","John R. McPherson","I think anybody could see that our aggregates business and some of our product lines will likely qualify for MLP treatment. But that said, I kind of come back to my answer to Ted's question, which is we're always evaluating a wide variety of options for improving our capital structure and our capital costs. We think that's of critical important -- critically important part of our jobs. Those options could range from the mundane such as the ratio of fixed to floating debt in our portfolio to options such as MLPs that may be a bit different. I think the good thing for us is that we have a lot of options. We're very disciplined in how we look at them. And I think it's the kind of topic you should expect us to talk more about at our Investor Day. Not MLP specifically necessarily, but our approach to the capital structure and capital allocation overall.","Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then turning to volume briefly. Just wondering if you can maybe say more on the cadence of volumes over the course of the quarter. We've heard that some highway job start dates have been impacted by the highway bill timing. September and October growth sounds like it was much stronger than July and August. Just curious what you've seen on that front?","James Thomas Hill","We -- I think the only highway jobs that we had delayed were in Northern California for any significant volume. It hurt our asphalt volumes. Other than that, we've seen very -- we saw very good highway shipments in the third quarter. We continue to see very large highway jobs start to ship in 2014. Most of those will actually go in 2015. And with those, I'm referring to some of the TIFIA jobs like the Grand Parkway in Houston. We shipped a little bit of that this year, the majority of it will go next year. I-75, 575 in Atlanta, we have 1.2 million tons of backlog on that job. We will only ship -- we've not begun shipping. I think we'll start in December and probably ship 40,000 tons in '14, the balance in '15, '16. So -- then we've got the I-4 work in Florida, which is 1.7 million tons of concrete rock and probably 2 million tons of base and fill. That job has actually been awarded to the contractors, but the construction materials has not been awarded. So we'll, for sure, get part of that, but that will ship second half of '15 and '16. So we didn't see any slowdown in the third quarter, but we think it will pick up in '14 if weather holds, but for sure, in '15.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","First, on the acquired assets during the quarter, could you clarify the revenue opportunities for these? And what portion are plug-and-play versus others that may require a little bit more work?","James Thomas Hill","Kathryn, would you -- I'm sorry, it's Tom. Would you repeat your question?","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Yes, on the acquired assets during the quarter, could you clarify the revenue opportunity for these? And what portions are plug-and-play, so really don't require as much handholding, versus others that require little bit more work? So just the understanding that it's not an even margin with all of the acquired assets. It doesn't have to be a specific dollar amount but just even a rough percentage in terms of understanding how much will require some -- a little bit more work to get up to speed versus others that are really good as a standalone right now?","James Thomas Hill","Well, I think, if you look at those assets, we had a partial quarter in the third quarter with the assets. They were already profitable in spite -- accounting for marking up inventories to market levels. We expect they are -- all of those are tucked into existing markets, except for New Mexico, and the New Mexico market is a very attractive market when it comes to profitability. So we think we'll hit the ground running with them in 2015, and they will be accretive in 2015.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. This is more of a Texas policy question. Could you provide any color on the impact of Proposition 1 referendum? And what that impact could be for TxDOT, if passed? And when would the dollars become available, if you have knowledge of that, if that referendum does, in fact, pass?","James Thomas Hill","Yes. It will be -- and actually, let's cross our fingers because it's being voted on today. It is $1.7 billion of new funds. It's from the oil and gas taxes paid by the drilling companies from the state's rainy day funds. Knowing how TxDOT works, I would say that they would be, if it passes, they will be available immediately, but probably, you won't see that flow through to -- at the earliest second half, probably second half of '15. Those will be a lot of overlays because this is really driven by the damage to the roads with all the truck traffic, with all the big energy plays and drilling in Texas. So I would -- and I don't know this for a fact, but my guess is that those funds would -- you would start seeing volumes from that sometime second half of '15.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Right. And speaking of energy, are you seeing any slowdown in energy markets given the drop in oil prices?","James Thomas Hill","We have not, and it's -- I think it's too early for that. But we continue to see that go very strongly, particularly the Gulf Coast projects. I think we'll ship about 500,000 or 600,000 tons on those jobs on the Gulf Coast in 2014. We'll see another -- I know we have another 2 million that we've backlogged to ship in '15, and there's probably, well on the books, on paper, there's another 10 million tons to be let. Now all of those -- probably all of those projects probably won't go, but even if half of them goes, it's a great shot in the arm for us.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And just to clarify, those are more energy-related versus port expansion related to Panama Canal?","James Thomas Hill","That's exactly correct.","John R. McPherson","Kathryn, it's John. Just back on your acquisition question quickly, I think if you look at them collectively, the profitability of those businesses on a unit basis should match or exceed our company average once we get past the very early integration phase. And again, these are bolt-ons. There's not a tremendous amount of hard work to do to pull them into our business. Our folks are doing a very good job of that already.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, great. And then final question on volumes. Just any more color on the type of projects you're seeing in Illinois and Texas? And what's the tail for these projects from a volume standpoint?","James Thomas Hill","I think that, on Texas, we've mentioned the Grand Parkway, which is, I think, a total of 1.2 million tons. Of that, we'll ship 400,000 or so. We will ship 400,000 at the end of 2014. The balance will go in '15. Again, we mentioned the energy projects in Texas. I think that this proposition, you'll see a lot of big asphalt work coming up. I believe that will pass. And then we're -- in Texas, you're just seeing all markets hit, residential, nonresidential, all of them are hitting. In Illinois, we have a number of projects. At O'Hare Airport and the widening of I-90 have been 2 very large projects for us. But again, we're starting to see the residential and the western suburbs of Illinois start to pick up also.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Tom, you mentioned that new lot development is continuing to increase, and I wanted to drill in a little bit on that. I mean, how much of a pickup have you guys seen in sort of the lot development as opposed to just aggregates to build houses as the recoveries kind of crank on?","James Thomas Hill","It really depends on where you are. In the more mature markets, California, Texas, Florida, parts of North Carolina and even Georgia, we're starting to see new subdivisions. And those are the places where we're starting to see the pickup. Kind of give you an idea where overall housing, we're seeing up low double digit, but if you look at specific markets and what demands happened in 2014 with aggregates, we've seen Los Angeles up 23%; San Antonio, up 23%; Dallas, up 18%; Nashville, which has been a little bit slower, up 12%; Atlanta is already up 15%; and then in Florida, Fort Myers is up 37%; Orlando is up 30%; Charlotte is already up 22%; and Baltimore is up 21%. So in those markets, where it's a little farther along, you're starting to see the subdivisions come in. Kind of the center of the country, we're still building out lots.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. And is it safe for me to assume that once you start getting those land development activities in place, they're a bit sort of longer tails and more steady than what might be sort of a bit more volatile kind of housing starts-driven stuff?","James Thomas Hill","Yes, absolutely.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. All right. Jumping around, looking at Texas, your volumes were up significantly in Texas. You didn't mention that as an influence on the average price. What does your price in Texas look like relative to the average?","James Thomas Hill","Now Texas is -- the pricing has jumped already. It will -- we don't give specific pricing, but let me just give you an example on that. We -- and depending on the market in Texas, in October, we secured between $1 and $2 of price increase, and we'll see another price increase of April of between $1 and $2 depending on the market. So you can tell that where the markets, as we talked about, where the market recovery is more mature, we're seeing big price increases, and in some of those markets, we're seeing price increases every 6 months instead of every 12 months.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Is that across the whole state?","James Thomas Hill","Yes.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And just to sort of circle...","James Thomas Hill","I mean, when I said across the whole state, each one of those markets is different, but all of them have sharp price increases, and they all have a lot of momentum.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Makes sense. Is it -- without trying to pin you down, was your average Texas price in the third quarter, was it above or below average?","James Thomas Hill","Oh, it's well above. I'm sorry, Todd you mean, company average?","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes.","James Thomas Hill","Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant price increase percentages.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, I'm sorry, yes. Just absolute price versus the company average price.","John R. McPherson","I think, Todd, back to not pinning it down, I think it would have been offset elsewhere by other volume changes. So the geographic exception for pricing for us for the quarter was really Illinois-related. I think that's the best way to look at it.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then final one for me right now. Just looking at that Slide 5, where you sort of give state-by-state on the volume increases. Rural South Carolina is the one that jumps out as being the only one that's not green. What -- anything in particular happen there?","James Thomas Hill","Yes, the guys in South Carolina are probably listening to this call hanging their heads, but it was only down 2%, and the impact was not so much demand. It was the fact that we had some very large project work last year that we don't have this year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to ask, Tom, maybe if you could provide some color. You're doing $3.93 gross profit per ton, up 12% year-over-year. How should we think about that going forward? And I just wanted to get a deeper understanding. You were talking about price for service, and it sounds like you have some good pricing power, and expect to see that in 2015. Does that imply that your 60% incremental margin can actually move higher if you realize that price?","James Thomas Hill","I think, on average, we stick to the 60%. Obviously, price increases will help that. And, obviously, we're operating at 50% to 60% of our production -- our peak production. The operating leverage in the plants continues to get bigger. But I think over time, it'll shoot up and come back down, but over time, I think that 60% is probably in line with what our expectations are.","John R. McPherson","I think one takeaway, Bob, is we have a long ways to go in the margin expansion and the positive flow-through. That story is still, just like the volume story, it's still in its early innings.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But you're doing kind of margins consistent with where you were at 150 million more tons. So it seems like you've taken out a cost -- a lot of costs out of the system, and I'm just trying to figure out how to think about profitability, assuming your volume strength continues into '15.","John R. McPherson","Well I think you're asking the right question. I'd encourage you to keep thinking about profitability on a per ton basis, and that's that way we present our financial statements. And that per ton profitability will, of course, be affected by pricing through time, which we're focused on every day, and we have some tailwind to there. It'll be affected by operating leverage and operating efficiency at our plant level. And it's, of course, also affected by a healthier product mix through time. I think all of those 3 things, we still have a long ways to go on. And our takeaway is that despite being, if you will, near previous high levels of unit profitability, we're nowhere near a cap or ceiling.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then when you're talking about sales and production mix, is there -- what's the opportunity look like there from a mix standpoint if you get better demand across the product line?","James Thomas Hill","Well, with new construction, you'll see an increase in sales for fines and base, which just allows us to sell the complete product split. And it just -- while those are low priced, they're very high margin, and they fill out our hand in selling the complete product line.","John R. McPherson","You saw a little bit of that in the current quarter. Our product mix hurt us on average selling price, but we still drove significant improving margin per ton, and that was one of the factors in this quarter.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, it's just tough to grasp externally a little bit just because of the moving pieces. John, just also wanted to understand on your guidance for 7% to 9%, what's -- on that 7% to 9%, what's the contribution from the recent acquisitions? So is that like 1 point or 0.5 point?","John R. McPherson","You're talking about the volume guidance, is that right, Bob?","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's correct.","John R. McPherson","I would think of a high end of that range on a same-store basis, so excluding impact of acquisitions for the year.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what percentage in the 7% to 9% should we attribute to acquisitions?","John R. McPherson","0.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","0, so it's negligible.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question on transport costs. And the news here, back in the quarter, any impact we should?","John R. McPherson","Keith, I can't quite hear you.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry. The question's on transport costs. Just was there any transport cost impact in the quarter? And should we expect any in near-term quarters?","James Thomas Hill","We didn't see any impact from transportation costs, rail, barge or ship. In fact, they were -- rail was flat for the quarter, I think barge was relatively flat.","John R. McPherson","Keith, and the way we present our financials, for freight-adjusted pricing and the way we flow that through, you wouldn't expect to have a significant impact for us the way we report our financials.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But from a cash perspective, no impact in the period outside of your expectations?","James Thomas Hill","No impact. Year-over-year, no impact.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Secondly, looking at, of course, we have another temporary highway bill taking it through the spring. Any new views there you're hearing, your trade routes [indiscernible] along the things of that nature?","James Thomas Hill","Well, we continue to see growing bipartisan commitment for infrastructure. Last month, Senator Boehner urged President Obama to work with Congress in 2015 for both tax reform and a multi-year transportation bill. Leadership in both parties want to find funding solutions, and I think all of them are tired of going back to the general fund and getting embarrassed about it. Last week, we did have House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tour our Chula Vista operation in San Diego. And he -- while he was there, he stressed congressional leadership's intention to get a highway bill passed in 2015. So we continue to see momentum behind it. I wouldn't expect it in the lame-duck session, but we've got our fingers crossed it will happen in '15.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Does a Republican Senate help you or hurt you towards that goal?","James Thomas Hill","I think, like I said, we're seeing bipartisan commitment, and I'm not sure if it helps or hurts us because they all want to fix the problem.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions left for me. One, you talk about the M&A environment, and you said some potentially attractive acquisitions. Can you talk about just kind of the valuations and how those are looking out in the market now versus what you've seen over the last few years? Are people starting to get a little bit more rational? Just any color you can give us on that, please.","James Thomas Hill","Sure. There's a lot of activity out there, and we see a lot of opportunities. Now with that activity, there's a lot of them that are very unattractive. There are some that -- there are a lot of them that we're looking at for our footprint that make a lot of sense for us. I think they're fair deals, and I think they're also acquisitions that we can improve dramatically by fitting them into our family. But it is busy, and there's some great stuff out there, there's also some junk.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just kind of on the valuation front. I mean, you got some junk and some others that are attractive, I guess, those are being priced accordingly then.","John R. McPherson","I think, Trey, I think just a lot of this comes down to the reason -- a lot of the reason we're focused on bolt-ons is the synergies you bring to a transaction, which typically, we don't pay for in a deal. And I think if -- and we're not going to get into the valuations of the individual deals we've done. But if you looked at them all collectively, again, in the most recent year, producing 8 million tons roughly. That has a lot of growth behind it, at or above our per ton profitability as a company. You can kind of draw your own estimates for valuation collectively. Again, individual deals vary. But I think what really drives it from our point of view and we're very, very focused on is the -- is obviously, the synergies with the rest of our market positions. That's what makes it go from I've kind of got a good deal to a very good deal, and a lot of what will drive the accretion in the next year for us.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got you. And Tom, you mentioned -- you touched briefly on some of these bigger energy programs down there, jobs that are being done over the next few years in the Gulf. What is the -- if you kind of look at that market, I know Texas overall is priced lower, but that market specifically, is that a higher priced market than Texas overall? And kind of how do we think of that from a profitability standpoint since that is one of your long-haul markets?","James Thomas Hill","It is a very profitable business for us. The pricing has very much improved over the last 18 months. But it's also, you got to remember, we are in the unique position to service those out of Mexico. So we have a dramatic freight advantage, which improves our profitability to service those markets.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And then last one's kind of housekeeping here. With the pullback in oil and just trying to get a sense for any kind of benefits you guys may see going forward, how much diesel are you guys using in your quarries now kind of post some of the recent acquisitions and divestitures and how that's moved?","James Thomas Hill","I think one way to look at diesel may be to look at it on what happens to the per gallon cost of diesel because it's -- we've got diesel cost in quarries, we have it in asphalt, we have it in ready mix. But right now, a dime movement per gallon of diesel would mean about $4.5 million for us annually.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Quick question on the M&A environment. Do you expect to see more -- I guess, as more sort of the private smaller type transactions are out there, do you expect to see more downstream assets kind of like what you picked up in New Mexico as part of the deal on a go-forward basis?","James Thomas Hill","Every one of those is different, and our focus is aggregates. We don't have any interest in picking up downstream unless it has aggregates attached to it. And when you look at those, some of those markets that have the downstream business attached to them, those downstream business are very profitable. And if they are, and we can -- we run them with a good return, we'll keep them. If not, we'll keep the aggregates and sell the downstream product lines.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. And then I apologize if I missed it, but on Slide 6, you kind of highlighted the 3 profit drivers. Is there a way to kind of rank order them from most contribution out of those 3?","John R. McPherson","I'd try -- I'd say no. I think the point is that you have to balance these and manage them in combination. And I think just the very heart of the business is you can't rank order them, you've got to make trade-offs at a local level between these factors.","James Thomas Hill","I would agree with that. I would also tell you that as the volumes come back and demand comes back, and new construction, the balance between those 3 gets a whole lot better, and as so our unit margins improve.","Operator","And we have reached our allotted time for questions. So I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Hill for closing remarks.","James Thomas Hill","Thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company, and we look forward to speaking with you during our next earnings call. Have a good day.","Operator","And thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."],"21953":["Vulcan Materials Co.

My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark D. Warren - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today for this call are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and John McPherson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.","To facilitate our discussion today, we have made available, during this webcast and on our website, supplemental information. Rather than walk through each slide, Tom and John will summarize the highlights of our quarterly results and outlook. We believe this approach will assist your analysis and will allow more time to respond to your questions.","With that said, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including general economic and business conditions, the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure, the highly competitive nature of construction materials industry, and other risks and uncertainties. These are described in detail in the company's SEC reports, including our earnings release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Vulcan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill. Tom?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I hope you've had time to review our earnings release and the supplemental information posted earlier today on our website. As you saw reflected in our financial results, our teams really hit on all cylinders during the first quarter, particularly in our core aggregate segment. We met our customers' needs for higher volumes of material. We continue to migrate prices upward with an eye towards longer-term returns on capital. We leveraged fixed cost and lowered our unit cost of goods sold even after excluding the impact of lower diesel cost. And obviously, our margins and total profits for the quarter grew rapidly as a result.","On a 21% gain in total freight-adjusted revenues for the company, our teams delivered 112% gain in total gross profit. It is certainly true that you can't extrapolate the full picture from a single quarter's results, but when you look at our results in the context of the last several quarters, you see very solid and improving fundamentals. Several things about this quarter really stand out in my mind, and I'd like to spend a little time discussing them with you.","As a starting point, I want to emphasize that we continue to believe that the recovery in our markets still has a long way to go. Our business is in the midst of a long, gradual recovery in demand. It's not unusual in such recovery to experience periods of relatively faster and slower growth. And certainly, our first quarter saw a number of positive things come together all at once, but we are still in early stages of recovery for the construction economy. For example, to underscore a point, we entered 2016 in terms of per capita Aggregate demand relative to long-term averages, pretty close to where we were at the time of the 1982 recession.","Having said that, clearly, the fundamentals of our business and our core aggregate focus strategy are very strong. This is, to our way of thinking, a recovery with real staying power. Of course, we will take 17% shipment growth whenever we can get it, but what impresses me about the quarter, and really the last 12-plus months, is a solid additional evidence of a sustained and sustainable recovery. It's supported by growth in all of our end-use market.","With public demand just beginning to strengthen, it is taking hold in more of our key market and is leading to volume gains in more of our key facilities, and it is supported by longer-term fundamentals, including sustained gains in construction employment, state and local revenue health, and early signs of rising wages and income. We will see some ebbs and flows in the rate of demand recovery and our shipment growth, but that's to be expected, particularly quarter-to-quarter.","The first quarter reinforces an important point. This recovery is real. It's broad based and our geographic breadth and positioning will serve us well as recovery moves forward. The first quarter provided a clear snapshot of this fact. Our overall shipments grew more than 15% even though our Texas and California businesses were flat to down. This is another indicator of a recovery with real staying power.","A second point is that our local teams throughout the company are not only executing well, they're also adapting well to changing market conditions. They have performed well and have maintained operating discipline and focus while challenged by rapidly increasing volumes. Their focus and ability to adapt, their expertise in balancing product mix, pricing and greater efficiencies day-to-day and week-to-week bode well for our future. It can be easy to lose our focus when adjusting and adapting to rising customer demands for quantity and quality of product, all the while hiring new staff and adjusting shift structures.","And finally, you have some profitability tailwinds at your back, such as lower diesel costs and higher product pricing. There could be a tendency to lose some operating discipline, but this hasn't happened. When demand has risen, our plant level teams have adjusted just as quickly to meet customer needs. They're highly focused on the operating details, critical to our long-term success, and are acting with discipline to ensure peak operating efficiencies.","Our sales teams have also responded effectively to ensure we're serving each market segment well, and our sales and operating teams have stayed coordinated in balancing production and demand. We're driving earnings while helping our customers grow. We're going to face some operating challenges as the recovery continues and as we grow. That's just the nature of operating more than 340 facilities across many states. But I take an extra measure of confidence from how well our teams have responded over the last two quarters.","Finally, a third point that strikes me as I reflect on the quarter and trends in our business, that's the payoff from our aggregates focus and from our commitment to continuous, compounding improvement in all aspects of our business. We brought our division presidents, our senior line of leaders from around the country together recently. And one of the things we discussed was the importance of keeping our energy which is electric. I can tell you right now that our people remain driven hungry for growth and improved performance. Our people, many of whom have 15, 20, even 30-plus years in the business, know that we are a long way from more normal demand and the corresponding profitability in our business.","We live this every day with many plants still running part-time and many crews still without full-time work. Our people are balancing immediate customer needs with the maintenance and investment required to serve the growth that is coming. So, our job is to keep tapping into that pride, that sense of ownership and competitive spirit in order to keep getting better day-in and day-out. And certainly, our shareholders benefit for this emphasis on continuous, compounding improvement.","As you've seen, we continue to expand our margins faster than pricing alone. And that improvement drives better returns on capital and allows for financially sound reinvestment. Since recovery began in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton in our Aggregates segment has improved $2, or 78% on a trailing 12-month basis. The drivers of this improvement are many and to some may seem dull, but the impact on our lasting franchise value is anything but dull.","Having shared these observations, I'll now hand it over to John for some brief commentary regarding our outlook. John?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the headline which was also noted in our release. Our full-year 2016 guidance for adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That said, we entered the second quarter tracking toward the high end of that range.","Now, looking at our first quarter results and at our momentum over the last few quarters, as well as listening to the comments Tom just shared, some of you may ask why are we not raising guidance at this time. Well, we'd like to be clear one more time that it's not because we lack confidence in the business' long-term fundamentals. If anything, that confidence has risen. And that's confidence in a recovery with multiple end-use segments and geographic drivers, and a constructive pricing climate allowing for more fair and adequate returns on capital as we move forward, and in our internal ability to execute and to adapt to changing market conditions, nor do we see any imminent threats that we're just failing to mention.","Simply put, it's early, and we need to take some care not to over-interpret any single quarter's results. We caution against it. As we've said frequently before, we encourage investors to also focus on longer-term trends. We believe that help separate the signal from the noise, if you will. And for this reason, you see us incorporate trailing 12-month figures and other longer-term trend information into our release and supporting materials.","With those caution shared, let me offer a few more comments regarding our current outlook for the balance of the year. We currently expect same-store aggregate shipments to be up 8% to 9% for fiscal year 2016 over fiscal year 2015. This compares to our early February expectation of about 7%.","Certainly, our first quarter shipments evidenced underlying strength in demand even after adjusting for weather and other favorable factors. Publicly funded construction activity has shown some year-over-year strength, although the effects of the Federal FAST Act and recent state and local funding initiatives have for the most part yet to flow through the system. And some of our end customers appear to be adding some capacity, albeit prudently and gradually.","Our updated same-store shipment growth expectation is roughly in line with the rate seen over the trailing-12 months. Again, we expect that growth rates will fluctuate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter as the recovery moves forward. That has been the pattern of this recovery and of past recoveries. So we're also seeing a recovery, although it has a good ways to go, that continues to see more geographic markets and more end-use segments participate fully.","With respect to aggregates pricing, we continue to project year-over-year growth in freight-adjusted average selling prices of approximately 7%. First quarter prices showed approximately 2% sequential improvement over fourth quarter pricing. Price increases that took effect in January and as of April 1 were generally well accepted by the marketplace and in line with our beginning-of-year expectations.","Aggregate unit margins should continue to expand faster than pricing, although the pace of that growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. As you saw in the first quarter, we're beginning to see some very good operating leverage as we leverage fixed cost to sales. And our overall cost performance of late, has benefited from lower diesel prices. Of course, those costs may rise as the year moves forward with some lag in corresponding product pricing.","We continue to expect year-on-year gross profit growth in our Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segments of approximately 20%, collectively. Our local leaders continue to manage material margins in those businesses very well, although they may see some downward pressure from currently strong levels as the year moves forward.","SAG costs were elevated in the first quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation-related accruals tied to our financial and stock price performance. We currently expect full-year SAG cost to remain roughly in line with our February guidance, and we will continue to leverage SAG expenses to revenues. Absent the effects of performance-based compensation and certain investments in our sales capabilities, overhead expenses have grown at an approximately 3% rate since 2013.","Our target for core capital expenditure investments remains at $275 million for the year, although we may elect to pull forward some future spending if justified by compelling sourcing opportunities, for example, lower heavy equipment costs resulting from pressures across the global mining sector. You'll see $108 million of PP&E investment reflected in our Q1 financials. A couple of comments. We typically work to frontload our spending on heavy mobile equipment in part so that we can see the benefits of associated operating efficiencies during the heavy construction season. And the PP&E spending figures and the financials also includes certain internal growth capital investments. For example, ships to serve our Yucatan operation, development of new quarry site, and development of new distribution facilities such as the railyard we just opened in Savannah, Georgia.","And including these internal growth investments, our total cash outlay for the year could be approximately $400 million. Vulcan's financial strength and flexibility allow for a balance of smart re-investment, pursuit of acquisition-led growth opportunities, and the ongoing return of capital to shareholders. Our overall capital structure and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. During the first quarter, both S&P and Fitch raised our credit ratings to investment grade status. During Q1, we returned approximately $50 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 257,000 shares during the quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $103.","I'll conclude my remarks by noting that our Q1 results represent another solid step toward our longer-term goals for the company's profitability when market demand recovers to long-term, normalized levels. Inside of Vulcan, we very much keep our eye on those longer-term goals. We have a lot of growth and a lot of work ahead of us. But the continuous, compounding improvements that Tom referred to have us well on track and well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges that will inevitably arise over the years to come.","Tom, back over to you.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. I'd like to once again thank our people, many of whom listen to these calls, for their hard work and dedication. I congratulate you for accepting the challenge of finishing 2015 strong and then repeating that performance to kick off 2016. For those of you in the investment community, I'd like to assure you the response to these strong results is to sharpen our focus to control what we can control and stay committed to getting a little better every day. In the course of doing this, I want to emphasize that we remain very committed to pursuing strategic M&A opportunities as they arise, further strengthening our asset portfolio in high growth markets across America.","We take confidence in what we've accomplished thus far in the recovery. And we have many opportunities ahead of us, but nobody is letting up. Taking just the basic measure of EBITDA, for example, while we're excited about our progress, we know that we still have a long way to go. And I can assure you that the Vulcan team is determined to reach our goals. Thank you again for your interest in Vulcan Materials.","And now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Gentlemen, I'm wondering if you can comment about early indications of pricing cadence for April. Last year, you were able to push pricing sequentially over the course of the year, and you had a 3% increase sequentially 2Q versus 1Q. I'm wondering how is this year shaping out. Do you think you'll be able to push pricing over the course of this year once again?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. As you look at the first quarter, I think this was a really good start to pricing. It was pretty consistent how we thought pricing would be accepted throughout our markets and with our plan. Overall, the climate for pricing remains very healthy. I think the environment is good throughout the construction industry. In fact, we would see some pockets of tight supply.","As the year goes on, we're going to comp over higher and higher prices with our success with that last year. But it's also about making profit in this business. It's about the balance of price mix and volume and that \u2013 and what's really important is that compounding effect of pricing. So I think, at this point, we're really pleased with our people's execution of their pricing plans, and we have really good confidence in our guys.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And can you talk about, on the public construction side, what's the speed of DOT request for bids turning into actual project where \u2013 how is that timeline shaking out? I guess on paper the DOT budgets look really good this year, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that materializing in terms of projects moving forward on time.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the DOTs are working really hard and really fast to turn their funding into projects, not the least of which is because of the political pressures that they feel. I think that if you look at the new \u2013 most of the new DOT spending that went into law the last \u2013 over the last year, you're not going to see much of that in 2017. I think they're plugging hard to get it out there, maybe a little \u2013 excuse me, you're not going to see much of that in 2016. Most of that will come in 2017. You may see a little bit at the end of 2016.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But they're working hard to get it out...","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...if they can.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Very aggressive. And Jerry, back on pricing, just with an eye toward the longer term, to echo Tom's point, we do like the climate we see. Everything seems constructive, very much in line with recent experience. And importantly for us, we seem to be a bit ahead of track on both pricing and margin improvement as it relates to our longer-term goals that we outlined at our Investor Day. So we're pleased with the results we see and it's a compounding improvement again, so we're looking to get it better quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. Just there's been obviously a great deal focus on the public end market, but I wanted to switch gears in terms of what you're seeing in the non-res end market because there's been some speculation that \u2013 could that market continue growth as we've seen. So, to that end, what are you seeing in terms of market demand trends from non-res projects, color on growth rate either by the quarter or for the trailing six months, and the types of projects you're seeing growth, growing best in your most important markets?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Kathryn, we continuously grow with the non-res. We look at the leading indicators, but what we're seeing in our markets and backlogs, are our customers continues to be healthy. As far as growth rate is concerned, it may not be as fast as last year, but it's still growing. I think that one of the things you'll see here is that the res is growing at a very fast rate, and usually non-res, particularly the retail construction will follow that. So, on the ground, we continue to see the growth. We still have a number of the large projects that we'll ship this year on the coast, and we also see some pretty healthy manufacturing growth.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Kathryn, one thing we're seeing that's a bit of a shift or a transition is our local teams are seeing a lot of small commercial work that's really popping up, and it's difficult to predict. This kind of pops up and gets executed pretty quickly. But we're seeing that in a number of markets, including (24:27) Nashville. So we think that bodes well for the overall health, mix, sustainability of the recovery to see this uptick in small commercial work across many of our markets.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you. And then on Georgia, last quarter, volumes were up 20%-plus. Our checks have seen at least a similar, if not healthier growth rate there. What are you seeing in terms of just how that state performed? But also importantly, just revisiting the prior quarter question which is have you seen any pickup in increased funding from that state, just increased volumes from the funding that was passed last quarter?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Georgia is really hitting on all cylinders, every market segment is growing. It's very healthy, housing, non-res. The highway is \u2013 actually, we've got a number of jobs that were backlog \u2013 very large jobs that were backlog prior to the funding. The state DOT has had a lot of pressure on it to turn out jobs in the new funding. So we may see some overlay work towards the end of the year in Georgia. But the real \u2013 I think, the real hit of the doubling of Georgia's funding will come in 2017 and 2018.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. And final question on Texas. In the past conversations we've had, you had said that Texas is really the only market that's getting close to getting back to normal. Are there any other markets that are getting kind of back to that normal market? And then, also just for the benefit of folks on the call, if you could differentiate within Texas what markets are \u2013 or what you would view back to (26:11) normal and what percentage of your Texas revenues are in each of those markets? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First of all, Texas is the only market we have that's anywhere close to normal demand. As far as commenting on the market in Texas, it's \u2013 as you said, it's a big place with many different markets. Overall, it remains very healthy. Dallas and San Antonio are still very strong. We're seeing rural Texas gets stronger and that's a \u2013 we have a big presence there, particularly the asphalt presence and that's good for us because it's driven by the increases in highway funding and the damage that was done to the roads from all the oil explorations.","Houston, we probably see some softening in res and non-res. It's a watch for us. The coastal work, we still have a lot of large work that we're shipping. There's a \u2013 when I say coastal, I mean from Brownsville to Beaumont. There's also \u2013 including Houston, there's also a number of jobs that are coming there. Now, timing of all that with big jobs, as always, you'll see ebbs and flows. But \u2013 so, overall, with the except for the watch on res and non-res, I'd tell you Texas markets are healthy.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Trey Grooms of Stephens.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats on a great quarter.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good morning.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Thank you, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","So, looking at \u2013 I guess kind of sticking with the geographic theme here, can you talk about how the geographic mix that you're seeing as well as product mix could be impacting your pricing and kind of your expectation there as we look through the balance of the year?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Trey, for the quarter and as we look for the balance of the year, they are really in total, I'm going to call it, geographic and product or customer mix issues were kind of awash. So, there's really no big impact in that in our pricing for the quarter. Back on the geographic point and really the broadening of the recovery, we do see more of our, if you will, Atlantic Coast markets and Southeast markets, really beginning to participate in the recovery more and more fully across more end-use segments. How exactly that plays out in terms of price and product mix impact over the course of the year, we'll have to see. But that's not a big driver and the pricing or margin results you've seen of late.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then on California being down, I mean, it sounded like in the fourth quarter that was a pretty good market for you, and then you noted seeing a slowdown there, and you pointed out some infrastructure work. Is that just timing? And then I know weather was obviously a factor there. Can you talk about kind of what the California market looks like when weather is cooperating for you guys?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. As we said, California was hit really hard in the first quarter with rain. We still see solid growth in demand in California. Short term, we could see some issues with Caltrans funding or timing of work. I think the good news for us about California is that market is very diverse. Our out (29:32) markets in California are very diverse. So this year on top of healthy residential market growth, we'll see a number of water projects, high-rise projects and airport projects start in 2016. So what I'd tell you is overall, long-term, we believe that the California will continue to experience sustainable growth.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. It's helpful. And then the last one for me is, I think that you had \u2013 when you first gave your guidance on your 4Q call, you had expected volumes to be more kind of back-half weighted. But obviously, with the big volume quarter now you guys just put up, just trying to think about how that changes your expectation for the quarterly cadence or kind of how the volumes kind of shake out as we progress through the year. And then with that, the obvious question we've been getting, do you think there was any pull-forward from some of these stronger markets that benefited from weather, kind of pulling forward into 1Q from 2Q or some other period?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Trey, it's John. I'll start and Tom could chime in. On the guidance, what we're trying to note is some of the El Nino-related weather effects that we did in fact see. And of course, you saw our \u2013 both our California businesses, and some of our Mountain West businesses, and a little bit Texas affected by that. In addition, as Tom just mentioned, we had a bit of a low on some large public construction work in California. But then, of course, despite those challenges on the volume side, we posted the results you saw today.","It's difficult to say if we had a little bit of pull-forward or a little bit of, I'm going to call it, overflow from 2015 where, for example, in North Carolina and South Carolina, some fourth quarter shipments were delayed by the bad weather they had. But as best we can tell, however, you adjust for it, we are seeing some strengthening in demand across more geographies, across more end-use segments. And as a result, you've seen us move our expectation for the year from 7% growth to 8% to 9% growth, in line roughly with what we've experienced over the last 12 months. We're seeing a recovery that still has a ways to go, but has more and more engines driving it, if you will. I think...","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's it for me. Thanks a lot, guys. Keep up the good work.","Operator","We'll go next to Garik Shmois of Longbow.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thanks and congratulations. You called out in the press release that you're starting to win share on large projects. And I remember a year ago at the Analyst Day when you indicated that this is \u2013 part of the strategy is we work through the recovery. It seems like it's bearing fruit. I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more context around where you are with your share gain platform as it pertain to perhaps the quarter and the last 12 months?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you remember, I think what we said was we \u2013 I think we probably lost some share in the downturn, and it's always \u2013 as the markets come back, we'll recover that. As the recovery continues to mature, you'll see higher and higher shipments in the really high growth quarters in our markets, which is where we are.","So, naturally, those jobs will be in our zone of natural advantage, so to speak, we're located. You'll also \u2013 we're also seeing more and more very, very large jobs, both commercial and highway work, and those also fall right in our wheelhouse. So it's just a natural recovery as the market returns.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","So, Garik, it's a little \u2013 it's a little hard for us to quantify that, especially kind of at this timeframe in the recovery. But as Tom said, I think it wouldn't surprise us if you're beginning to see some of the larger, more sophisticated producers recovering a little bit of share that they gave up in the downturn.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. Just want to switch to some of the cost buckets within aggregates. Specifically, is it possible to indicate what your diesel cost was in the quarter? And then also on repair and maintenance, it has been trending up over the last several quarters. It was up again in the first quarter. Can you provide an outlook on R&M costs as you move through the balance of the year? Is it still going to be elevated on a year-on-year basis, or will some of those costs start to plateau?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Sure. I'll start, Garik, and then Tom will chime in, in just an attempt to give you some more color as best we can. Again, first thing we'd highlight that is if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, even excluding the positive effects of diesel, our overall unit cost of sales is essentially flat. So what's really behind that, if you take a \u2013 again, a trailing 12-month view is that our teams are doing a great job and they've been able to get some real operating leverage as volumes have increased, and that's offset some of the cost pressures that come from higher R&M that we've been talking about.","So all in all, they're doing a great job. We've really seen that for the last two quarters. We hope to keep seeing it going forward. We'll keep an eye on it. But we're certainly very pleased to see that cost performance.","In the quarter, our average diesel price is probably about $1.30, probably $5 million, $6 million benefit from that in total. But, again, what we'd underscore. And then our R&M in the quarter, as we said, it was still elevated. To give you a rough order of magnitude, the way we look at it, it's probably $0.08 up per ton. So that's an issue we manage tightly. We keep an eye on it. But in the context of our overall margin structure, it's not a defining characteristic.","So again, we'll continue to manage it well. Our team is doing a great job. We're beginning to see some real operating leverage. And importantly, even excluding the benefits of diesel, we've been able to keep cost relatively flat.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd tell you, I'm not surprised to see R&M cost at this point in the cycle and that may continue for a while. We're still playing catch-up on putting plants up, run the plants harder. We've got to remember we're still in the early stages of this, a lot has been on gradual recovery. The volumes are still \u2013 the rather recovery is still early. I think what \u2013 as John said, what I'm pleased to see is that over the last 12-plus months or five quarters, we're seeing a trend of the other cost and the operating efficiencies start to improve which tells me that we're leveraging the volume not only on fixed cost, but also on some of the variable cost and the operating efficiency.","So, to John's point, I think our folks are doing a really good job adjusting and adapting to rapidly changing volumes. We have a long way to go. And I think that as this continues to mature in the recovery, we'll continue to see that fixed cost and variable cost volume leverage.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","That's super helpful. Last question is just quickly on the asphalt volumes that declined in the quarter. Was that mainly driven by some of the commentary that you indicated that California had experienced over the last quarter?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. California asphalt was hit hard. You just can't lay it obviously in the rain. I think we're pleased with our overall asphalt performance. Despite California being down, Texas volumes were up, driven by \u2013 a lot by both textile work and private markets. I think we \u2013 our folks have done a good job of managing a mix of price, cost of material margins and all the while serving our customers, and that's tough to do in the first quarter with icy weather. So even with California down, I think we're pleased with our performance in asphalt for sure.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Thanks, Garik.","Operator","We'll go next to James Armstrong of Vertical Research.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Good start to the year. Congrats. First question I had is on the weather impact as we go into the second quarter. Obviously, the South has been really, really wet in places. Are you seeing any impact of that as we go into the second quarter, or have you been able to pretty much overcome that so far?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously, April has been wet. Anybody can look at the weather and tell that. But we would always tell you that we're going to \u2013 quarter-over-quarter or even month-over-month, yes, you're going to have weather, yes, you're going to have things that will affect you positively and negatively, but you can't judge it quarter-over-quarter or month-over-month.","You really got to look at long term. So regardless of what the weather does, the demand is there, and if they don't \u2013 if it gets delayed, it's not going away. It's just postponed. And it always catches up and it always happens. But month-to-month, we're going to have periods of good weather and bad weather.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And, James, we're not going to comment on April sales on this call. So, we'll talk about that in our next call.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. And then going to asphalt, margins were absolutely fantastic there in the quarter. Should those continue or should those come under a little bit of pressure as oil prices start to march up? And can you talk about the lag in asphalt and oil?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you look at the \u2013 the quarter material margins are probably a little ahead of schedule \u2013 a little ahead of our expectations. We could see some pressures with \u2013 as \u2013 the changing liquid AC prices. Again, I think our folks are doing a really good job of managing that, and this is a balance of volume, price, cost of material margins. So \u2013 and there is a lag there, we're trying to predict what that is and how that is. Asphalt sometimes runs through the cadence of it and sometimes it doesn't, but we'll manage that as it comes along.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer of BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning, guys. I'd also say congrats.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Adam.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","I wanted to ask about firstly on M&A. Maybe some updated thoughts on that, you putting your investment grade rating to work.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, I'd tell you that we are in a \u2013 we are very pleased with the purchases we made over the last 18 months and how they performed, and they performed very well. The M&A market continues to be healthy. We continue to be \u2013 so, it's a huge focus for us. It's something that we pay a lot of attention to. We're very busy with it. Obviously, we can't talk about anything we're working on, but we'll let you know when that happens and when those come \u2013 when those finalize. But it's healthy. We're focused on it and it's a priority for us.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Would you \u2013 are you going to preference either the smaller deals or larger deals at this point in the cycle?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll \u2013 I think what we look at and what we concentrate is what fits us both large and small, what are \u2013 is unique synergies to us and making sure that we buy it for the right price and then we integrate it, so it's both.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then, also as we think about 2017 and the potential for DOT work to benefit from the FAST Act. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of whether pricing on that work is lower or maybe the incremental margin opportunity on that work is less, maybe just some color on that would be helpful?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that the impact of DOT spending both state and federal coming to fruition, and shipments will only help pricing.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And of course, not just \u2013 we'd always encourage you to focus \u2013 you and anybody, not just to focus on pricing, but overall margin performance. And that volume, that mix, that's good for our overall balance of price. The operating efficiencies, product mix, let's just say, we're looking forward to it.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Great. Thank you very much.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Hey, Timna.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","These should be fairly quick. We've talked about a lot of these topics, but I just wanted to touch on 2017 because some of the independent forecast for non-residential construction have been tapering their enthusiasm into 2017. So is that just maybe excess enthusiasm on their part or is there something that you might be able to help us understand about tapering in 2017 activity, whether that be some of the big projects rolling off or anything else?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Timna, honestly, we haven't given any guidance for 2017. So just with that qualification first, I think where we come back to in case it's helpful is what we see if you will on the ground. And the momentum that we're seeing overall as it relates to private construction and private non-res is \u2013 is largely unchanged. I mean, there are going to be specific geographic markets, for example, Houston, that with layoffs, et cetera, we keep an eye on. But in total, we still like the momentum we see, the breadth of the recovery, the breadth of the end markets, the higher levels of small commercial work that we see. So from our kind of humble on the ground view, the death of non-res has been announced prematurely.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think on the housing piece, the housing recovery still remains pretty modest compared to historical cycles. And most forecasters would expect it to continue to gain steam, so \u2013 and non-res will follow that.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And the large project pipeline we have seen as it relates to larger industrial projects, still largely unchanged. So, again, we obviously keep a close eye on it. We haven't \u2013 we're ways away from anything that we consider 2017 guidance in our part. But what we do see, and we've talked about more for 2017 also, is just the beginning of the increase in public construction beginning to kick in, strengthening public demand, and we're kind of getting to the point in the cycle where that's beginning to kick in a bit more also.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. The other question is about your high quality problem which is a very low dividend yield. And I understand that you just doubled your dividend, but I was just wondering if you could talk around the way you think about it philosophically, and is there a target yield, is there something that drives the way your board thinks about the dividend or the right level of it?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Sure. I'll start. I think you're right, a high quality problem to have. First, we're focused again on balancing re-investment in the business, investment in growth, including the M&A opportunities that Tom discussed, and ongoing return on capital to shareholders. We think we have the financial flexibility and strength to balance those goals over time. We do not have a target dividend yield.","And it's really a board decision as to revisit it, of course, periodically. We do think of it in the context of overall return of capital to shareholders and balancing those other objectives very much including growth. But we do not have a target dividend yield. We do expect our payout ratio over time will be roughly consistent with companies of our credit rating and size.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Keith Hughes of SunTrust.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. You don't have any more notes due until 2018, so how would you characterize the use of cash flow the next couple of years between acquisitions, debt pay-down and share repurchase?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","Our capital allocation and cash usage priorities have really remained unchanged from prior communications. So just to briefly echo some of those, one, we have intentionally managed our balance sheet so that we have the kind of flexibility that you just mentioned. We will make the appropriate operating capital investments back in the business to maintain the value of our franchise. We do not expect to need to use cash to pay down debt. Obviously, we don't have maturities due in the near term, but we're comfortable with our current level of debt.","We will continue to pursue growth opportunities aggressively, whether those are M&A related or, as we mentioned in our release and in our comments, whether they are internally driven growth opportunities, investments in new railyards, new quarry sites, the kind of things that we would do internally. We have several opportunities there.","We \u2013 to the point the question just asked on the dividend, we would expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with our earnings for a while. We're very focused on the sustainability of that dividend throughout the entire cycle. And then as we said before, we will be opportunistic as we go forward and potentially using share repurchases or other means to return any excess cash to shareholders after those other priorities.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","In acquisitions, would those be in the current footprint, or are you willing to look outside the current footprint for the right opportunity?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","To answer your question, both, and we've done both. Some of our highest returns on capital are the bolt-ons because they complement your existing operations and they defend some of your existing \u2013 the operations. But we'll look outside of our footprint. I mean, we just did that with New Mexico over the last 18 months. But I think would we go outside our footprint, we would want to go in as a number one or number two producer, or a path to be number one or number two. So \u2013 but to answer your question, it's both.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Betts with Jefferies.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you very much. I'd like to come back on the cost question please. And looking at the $0.68 per ton saving in Q1, I think that equates to about $27 million. You've kindly explained diesel's saving of $5 million or $6 million, and I think the R&M was an offset of about $3 million. So, I'm still missing a big number there, sort of $24 million, $25 million. Is that all operating leverage because the volume growth was so high or is there anything else there? That's kind of my first question.","My second question, when we're looking at the full year in terms of costs, you highlighted the trailing 12-month flat cost. Is that a pretty decent assumption to make for the full year? Thank you.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that to start with your first question, I think it's a combination of operating leverages and improved volumes and operating efficiencies on the variable side. So, it's a combination of both of them. There is a lot of volume leverage in that, but it's a combination of the two.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Are there any one-offs in there?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","(50:19).","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think one of the things, timing of stripping, Mike, I would say maybe had some benefit of it that will \u2013 that's always comes in, get some stars, but it's not a whole lot.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","And, Mike, for the full-year outlook, we'll see. We're very focused, as Tom mentioned, on continuing to drive these operating efficiencies to control what we can control, to use Tom's words, and to leverage our cost of sales where we can. We'll see how it come out. There are a lot of moving pieces in the business like ours, but it's something we're very, very focused on.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Question back on the cost side, at what point do you start to add more and more shifts, is this kind of more later in this year or into next year, and \u2013 or maybe think about it, can you meet the 9% sort of same-store sales growth on the existing head count maybe running a little bit of over time? Just, how do we think about adding shift work on a go-forward basis?","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, I wish we were running two shifts everywhere. I'm a little operator guy. And that \u2013 that's \u2013 life is good if that happens. I think that \u2013 but it's on a market-by-market, plant-by-plant basis. So for example, you've got \u2013 if you go to Texas, you've got plants that are running two shifts already. You go to some markets in our some of our Atlanta operations, they're running \u2013 they're not even running full shifts. So, it's such a local business and that is market-by-market. So there's not a broad-based statement. But I don't \u2013 overall, we'll do that a little bit at a time, but we're nowhere close in most markets to adding shifts. It's really adding hours or even adding a full shift on a \u2013 a full shift on a full plant, but we would love to have those problems.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great news.","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","We also, Stanley, back to Mike's point, we're probably getting \u2013 with the breadth of the recovery, we're probably getting to a point where we have enough volume and more of our key facilities to begin to realize a little more operating leverage, leverage and fixed cost. Now, we're long ways away, and Tom, we discussed it from many kind of operating sweet spot, and we're even further away from production capacity. But one of the benefits to us of getting more volume and more places is that it helps on the fixed cost leverage.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And on the growth CapEx piece, I think it was like $125 million for Savannah and for the ships. I imagine the cost realization is pretty immediate when all this starts to flow through. But how should we think about that? Does that pick up more into next year, or is that even kind of more into \u2013 closer to 2018 when you start to see the cost savings from these investments really start to come through?","John R. McPherson - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer","I'll break it into two pieces for you. Think about \u2013 of the $275 million of operating and maintenance CapEx, for many of those investments, we begin to see operating efficiencies pretty darn quick if we are improving or right-sizing mobile equipment fleet, if we're replacing screens or otherwise improving our production processes at a plant level. We try and work those as best we can to have pretty quick return periods on those investments.","For the $125 million, for the course of the year that we may spend on growth-related PP&E, it's really going to depend on the nature of the investment. These aren't long-term payoff things. These aren't things where you invest one year and you get the benefit 10 years down the road. But it's highly variable whether it's a new railyard or incremental reserve capacity at a quarry or whether it's a new ship, so it's hard to say on the growth capital.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No. Fair enough. Great, guys, and congratulations.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","That's all the time we have for questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.","J. Thomas Hill - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.","Donald M. James","Thank you. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our first quarter 2014 results. As the operator said, I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials.","Joining me today are John McPherson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Hill, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","A slide presentation will accompany this webcast and will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of the presentation contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2014 earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","We are very encouraged by our performance during the first quarter and with the recovery in demand for our products. Despite the challenges inherent in an unusually cold and wet winter in many of our markets, our employees delivered solid shipment growth and improved margins.","During the quarter, we successfully completed the previously announced sale of our Florida area cement and concrete assets to Argos, as well as the related repurchase of $506 million of our outstanding debt.","Vulcan is well positioned to increase our shipments and our earnings, and to expand our aggregates operations and reserves as we move forward.","Turning now to Slide 3. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong earnings leverage in our aggregates business. Aggregates volumes increased 6% and we leveraged those incremental tons into significantly higher earnings.","The 9% increase in net sales led to a 93% increase in gross profit.","Reported earnings from continuing operations were $0.41 per diluted share versus a loss of $0.47 in the prior year. Included in these earnings improvements are $1.04 per diluted share of income related to the sale of the company's Florida area cement and concrete assets, and $0.35 per diluted share in charges to interest expense referable to the $506 million of debt repurchase.","Adjusted for these onetime transactions, earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.28 per diluted share, a $0.19 per share improvement from last year.","Reported EBITDA for the quarter was $267 million, which includes a $220 million gain from the sale of Florida concrete and cement assets, and $7 million in other income, primarily from the routine sale of reclaimed land from former operating sites.","Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA grew 50%, from $26 million last year to $39 million this year. This improvement was driven by both increased aggregate shipments and by higher aggregate prices, which more than offset higher costs resulting from production challenges due to weather.","Non-aggregate cash gross profit benefited from higher asphalt volumes and higher materials margin.","With that said, I'd like to now turn the call over to Tom Hill to give us a few more specifics about our first quarter results.","James Thomas Hill","Thanks, Don. Taking a look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 4, you'll see the resulting revenue and gross profit impact from higher shipments and pricing.","Aggregates segment revenues increased 13% and segment gross profit increased 55%. Aggregates shipments increased 6% versus the prior year, despite very cold weather in most of our markets. Shipments in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas showed strength, each increasing by more than 15% versus the first quarter of last year.","Due to favorable -- due to unfavorable weather, first quarter shipments in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina were lower versus the prior year. Strengthening private construction demand more than offset the effects of extremely cold weather in Georgia, and unusually wet weather in Florida, resulting in year-over-year growth in shipments in these markets.","In other areas harder hit like Virginia, the number of available shipping days was cut in half by extreme winter weather. This restriction on construction activity and available shipping days impacted both our aggregates and concrete business in Virginia. That said, we expect shipments delayed beyond the end of March due to weather to be recovered in the following months as the construction season gets underway.","Aggregates pricing for the quarter was up 2% versus the prior year. These solid results were despite an unfavorable geographic mix due to the impact of weather on volumes in several higher price markets. Without the unfavorable geographic mix impact due to weather, our year-over-year pricing increased 3%.","Slide 5 highlights the favorable operating leverage in our aggregates business. Trailing 12-month volumes have increased 8 million tons or 6%, while aggregates segment's gross profit improved $84 million or 25% due to higher pricing, the earnings leverage of volume growth and cost control.","Turning to Slide 6. We compare our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton at the end of the first quarter with the prior year and the prior peak volume, which occurred in the first quarter of 2006. Trailing 12-month unit profitability has increased 6% from the prior year. More significantly, cash gross profit per ton is 31% higher than the prior peak volume. This is remarkable considering the fact that current volume is 50% below the prior peak.","This improvement of more than $1 per ton reflects the accomplishments of our employees to effectively manage cost and improve price throughout this downturn. This per ton gain also illustrates the attractive structural characteristics of our aggregates business. Higher unit profitability sets the stage for significant earnings growth in this improving demand cycle.","Now I will turn the call over to John to provide some commentary about the outlook.","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Tom. Our volume growth in the first quarter and resulting earnings improvement that Tom just discussed are a really solid start to what we believe will be a very strong year for overall demand growth. The demand momentum, which began in the second half of 2013, is continuing in 2014. And our margins are expanding due to the combination of operating leverage, cost disciplines and growth in pricing.","Turning now to Slide 7. You see a breakdown of our expectations for aggregates demand by each of the major end markets. These expectations are consistent with the demand outlook we discussed during our fourth quarter conference call in February, but let me share a bit of color regarding what we see in the market as of the end of the first quarter.","Two points to start. First, we continue to expect each end market to grow in 2014, with private construction recovering most rapidly. Secondly, we expect Vulcan's served markets to grow at a faster rate than the markets we do not serve. We're very pleased with how our portfolio is positioned, as the recovery in construction activity continues to take hold.","Now touching on activity and trends in specific end-use markets. In private residential, we continue to see broad-based growth across our geography, led by states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. But in addition, we're also seeing residential construction activity in aggregates demand recovering in important areas such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Nashville.","In private nonresidential, our markets are beginning to benefit from some growth in office and commercial work, complemented importantly by rising demand from large industrial projects.","As we've noted before, these projects can represent large quantities of aggregates supplied over multiple years. And Vulcan is very well positioned to serve these customers, particularly along the Gulf Coast.","These projects provide an exciting opportunity for our aggregates business. That said, the timing of shipments can vary and we continue to monitor them before the actual shipment days.","Now we're also seeing strengthening large project activity in the public arena, including in transportation infrastructure. Although it has taken longer than most of us expected, federally funded TIFIA projects are beginning to drive additional aggregate shipments. The Grand Parkway in Houston and the Northwest Corridor in Atlanta are just 2 projects we expect to begin shipments to in 2014, or have already begun to make shipments to.","Additionally, state-level funding initiatives across several states are beginning to drive new project lettings, with Virginia and Maryland just being 2 examples.","While the parameters surrounding the renewal of the Federal Highway Bill remain uncertain, large transportation infrastructure projects and the growth in contract awards we've already seen should provide reasonably stable demand in this end market for the balance of the year.","Overall, we expect modest growth in shipments in the public end markets in 2014, and we're optimistic with respect to public infrastructure construction in 2015 and beyond.","So while the first quarter does not make a year, our local teams and our customers are excited by what they see in the early stages of this recovery. Activity and confidence are rising across an increasingly broad group of geographies and end uses. And we believe Vulcan's people and assets are very well positioned to meet our customers' rising aggregates demands during this time.","Before turning the call back over to Don for some closing remarks, I'll comment on 2 additional topics that continue to be priorities, particularly as we look toward another year of earnings growth and hopefully a multiple year recovery in demand.","The first topic is the strengthening of our balance sheet. During the quarter, both our sale of cement and concrete assets to Argos and our repurchase of approximately $500 million in debt closed as expected.","As you can see on Slide 8, net debt to trailing adjusted EBITDA is down from 6.4x to 3.6x. Coupled with unit margins and earnings, this improvement in our balance sheet allows us the flexibility to reinvest in growth, whether through margin-enhancing capital projects, bolt-on acquisitions, or other opportunities to strengthen our aggregates franchise.","And of course, we've continued to add to our portfolio as opportunities present themselves. Over the past 18 months, we have acquired assets and improved on our ability to serve customers in areas such as San Diego, Atlanta, San Antonio, Charleston and Northern Virginia.","The second topic I would like to highlight briefly relates to the value of the land we own and our commitment to manage these holdings in a manner that generates value for both our shareholders and the communities in which we operate.","Our first quarter results included $18 million in cash proceeds and a $6 million pretax gain on the sale of 2 properties, a former Baltimore area quarry, of which a schematic depicting the intended use is shown here on Slide 9; and a parcel of land on the river in Chattanooga. Those of you who have followed our company closely know that the disposition -- that dispositions such as these are not at all out of the ordinary. Since 1998, we have generated an average annual cash proceeds of approximately $32 million from land sales.","Vulcan owns more than 110,000 acres of land, a significant portion of which is in urban or urbanizing areas. We will continue to operate and develop these properties with an eye toward their post mining uses and the ultimate value to both our shareholders and our neighbors.","I'll now turn the call back over to Don for some closing comments.","Donald M. James","Thanks, John. Let me close by saying that we're encouraged by the improving economic fundamentals we see in our footprint. Our outlook for aggregate volume and price growth remains very positive, consistent with the guidance we gave in February. We expect 2014 to be another year of earnings growth for Vulcan, and we're well positioned to capitalize on the multiyear recovery in demand that we believe is in front of us.","Thus far, in this recovery, we have leveraged modest volume growth and strong growth in earnings due to the operating leverage inherent in our aggregates business and the disciplined execution of our operation and sales teams.","This operational performance by our teams gives us tremendous earnings upside as volume recovery continues.","In our non-aggregates segments, we continue to expect to earn $40 million to $60 million in gross profit in 2014. These improved results include higher earnings in asphalt and the return to profitability of our concrete segment.","With our improved capital structure, we're excited about the possibilities of expanding our aggregates operations and reserve base and further enhancing our footprint in the fastest-growing U.S. markets. We are continuing to pursue a number of attractive growth opportunities that will enhance our earnings potential.","This is an exciting time and an excellent opportunity for Vulcan, and we remain committed to adding lasting value built around our unmatched asset base.","And now, the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was hoping to touch on margins. I know you mentioned you were pleased with the performance in the quarter. And specifically on the aggregate side, I was wondering if you could just walk through kind of the puts and the takes on the incrementals, what weather impact may have been in the quarter if you're able to impute it based on shipping days available and maybe just start there?","John R. McPherson","Sure, Ted. This is John. First, I'd say there were 2 major weather-related impacts that affected our incrementals in the quarter. One was production, both amount and efficiency. And we had an inventory reduction in the quarter, which led to about a $2.8 million negative variance of profitability for us for the quarter. The other impact, as Tom mentioned, was a negative geographic mix in terms of pricing and margin, and that contributed another negative $3.7 million in headwinds to us. So on a normal geographic mix and on a normal production basis, we would have been $6.5 million or so higher in the aggregate segment gross profit line. When you walk that across and there's one other thing I'd note, I think, Ted, you get to the kind of numbers that you're used to seeing, we continue to believe in the 60% flow-through number that we stated before, particularly through the cycle. And again, I think, when you make those adjustments for both the geographic mix and for production, you'll see the kind of incrementals you're used to seeing from us.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Was there anything on the freight side or the logistics side that was a notable call out in terms of just the dilution would add to the underlying volume-based incrementals?","John R. McPherson","Well, there's 1 -- that's an important question. I think, 1 thing to note, within our aggregates segment, we have intentionally grown our transportation-related revenues and this is a profit enhancement for us. These revenues come with substantially no capital commitment but they already lower margin as a percent of sales. So in the quarter, those revenues grew from about $60 million to $80 million as being supporting products and services, transportation-related. So Ted, to be clear, what I call the non-direct stone revenue, that grew at a rate of 32%, 33% during the quarter. It's very -- it lends to our incremental margins per tons sold. It's very good for us to do. It's an important profit enhancement, but it does, if you look at the total segment numbers, dilute the margin.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful. So the last thing I'll ask, and I'll jump back in queue, is you talked about the cash cost per ton being down 8% year-on-year, could you just bridge us what the key variables were in the first quarter and then how we should think about those variables in the second through fourth quarter?","John R. McPherson","I'll probably let Tom comment. But the cash margin was up is what I'd highlight, not the cash cost down.","James Thomas Hill","The cash cost -- this is Tom, Ted. The cash cost per ton was virtually flat. And that is attributed to our people in that they were operating in really tough conditions, which affect -- negatively affect operating parameters. So we were pleased with a relatively flat cash cost year-over-year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then, as we think about that cost dynamic going forward, I know you said there's a lot of labor leverage going forward but are there any other kind of headwinds or tailwinds we should just be mindful of as we kind of model going forward?","James Thomas Hill","I think that the rising volumes always help those cash costs because there's a big piece to that. I think, our folks have done a good job keeping our equipment and operations in good shape, ready for rising volumes. And that's a matter of really adding hours at this point.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And the last thing I'll just ask before I jump back in queue, any chance you could just characterize kind of how April started off or the quarter started off?","John R. McPherson","I think, Ted, we'll have to answer that when we get into the second half. Our volumes were up more in March than they were in the balance of the quarter. I think, they were up 9% in March. We like the momentum through the quarter and coming out of the second half of last year. But let's talk about April when we get to our second half call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Analyst","[indiscernible] filling in for Bob. So if I do the math on your assumptions for end market growth, it would imply aggregates volume growth at the top end of your guidance range. As compared to the outlook provided in February, would you say you were more encouraged about the outlook for volume growth at this point in the year?","James Thomas Hill","Well, I think, we're experiencing broad-based growth throughout all of our markets. And we're hearing a lot of -- this is Tom, I'm sorry, and we're hearing a lot of confidence from customers, suppliers and employees. To try to give you a little color, throw a local color on that, the California -- the private segment in California continues to improve. UCLA is predicting housing permits up 27%. Texas was really hitting on all 8. Residential and non-res continues to improve in Texas. We're beginning to see new subdivisions in Houston and San Antonio. We secured a number of very large energy-related projects along the coast. The large -- the 4 largest of which would be over 2 million tons. And then, the highway segment in Texas is healthy. We talked about before we secured the Grand Parkway in Houston, which is a TIFIA project, we begin to ship it. The central U.S. is a little slower to return, but we are starting to see recovery. We've secured a number of large projects in Illinois and residential is starting to -- we're seeing growth in residential in Nashville and Knoxville. Georgia is a market that we're very pleased with, the residential continues to accelerate and commercial is following. And while the highway funding is flat, we have secured the Northwest Corridor, which John mentioned earlier, which is a TIFIA project, they'll start to ship probably towards the end of 2014. Our Florida market continues also to improve. Residential continues to grow, commercial is following that healthy. With health -- an example of that is the Doral Breeze project in Miami, where we secured 750,000 tons. The Carolinas, we're starting to see residential improved in the Carolinas, really driven by Charlotte, as John mentioned. In Virginia, we also see improved residential and some big projects like the Midtown Tunnel, which is a TIFIA project. So overall, we have a lot of confidence in our markets. I think, you do have to remember, this is the first quarter, and there's a lot of -- to play out, there's a lot of noise in the first quarter. So at this point, I think, I'd have to tell you we're comfortable with our range.","Unknown Analyst","That's great. And then, on pricing, aggregate prices were up 2% versus your guidance of 3% to 5%. And so how much is your expectation for accelerated pricing gains as a function of improving mix versus maybe a true pricing power as volume growth accelerates?","James Thomas Hill","Well, I think, we're seeing pricing momentum all across the markets. Now as we say early on, every market, even submarket, prices at different times, it is a whole mix there of timing of pricing. But while we -- even through the downturn, we were able to get price increases. So with growing markets, growing demand, growing confidence, it just gives you better pricing momentum. Again, much like volume, we're -- just coming out of the first quarter, there was a lot of noise in there. So we -- I think, we're comfortable with that until we have a few more months of real construction cycle under our belts.","John R. McPherson","I think, you hit the keyword, which is momentum. And while it's early, we're really excited about the momentum, both on the volume side across geographies, and as Tom mentioned, on the pricing and margin side in our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the private nonresidential buildings estimate you have. Very bullish estimate here, both in your markets and as a whole. Can you kind of list off 1, 2 or 3, which of those you think will be the best and which could be potential laggers this year in that segment?","James Thomas Hill","I think, the best was going to be the private residential. And that's typical in that the non-res will follow the private -- the housing. But there's a component to the non-res that is a little different this time and that is the big energy-related projects that we've seen along the ports. So the answer to your question, to be clear about it, across the country, residential is leading but non-res is, as usual, comes behind it. But that non-res is bolstered by those -- the big energy plays on the Gulf Coast.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So, and within nonresidential, you would expect the energy and I assume industrial to be the leader in office and retail development to be a little less than that, would that be fair?","James Thomas Hill","I think, right now, right at this time, that's correct. But you are starting to see the building and the -- come on and the traditional non-res, strip centers and things like that, you're starting to see those come on which are -- it's following the residential.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And for Vulcan, is the aggregate intensity, how do those end user markets within nonresidential compare?","Donald M. James","Well, historically, highways are the most aggregate-intensive. Industrial projects would be next because, particularly the ones on the Gulf Coast, the first step in the process is to build a pad on which you can expand a refinery or build an LNG facility or an industrial plant along the Gulf Coast in low-lying areas. So those are significantly aggregate-intensive. Then, traditional commercial construction will be next and residential is the least aggregate-intensive. Although in the residential area, as you know, the primary use of aggregates is in lot development, streets and utilities and infrastructure. And in this, unlike residential construction 1 year or 18 months ago, we're now in a lot development phase, which is more aggregate-intensive than residential would be thought as steady state.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Question on the $2.8 million inventory drawdown in the quarter. Just wondering, was this primarily in weather-hit markets or is it a bit more broad-based? And if you could talk about the outlook for inventory management for the balance of the year and if there's going to be any impact on incremental margins?","James Thomas Hill","Garik, this is Tom. The drawdown on inventory was really due to the bad weather, the cold weather in the East. It is just very inefficient or impossible to run in snow and ice. So that was intentional on our part. And I don't see that inventory being an impact going forward, we'll catch that up and move on. But you just -- you create a lot of cost and a lot of pain for yourself if you try to run in really, really bad weather.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And I guess, if you could talk about -- you touched upon your views on private non-res. And you've talked about for a couple of quarters now the sensitivity to your guidance, depending on whether or not some of these big projects in the South commenced this year and certain timing around these projects. As you move through the first quarter, as we sit here in early May, can you talk about your visibility with respect to these big projects now as opposed to a quarter ago, and what your level of confidence that they actually get started this year versus next year?","James Thomas Hill","We've seen a couple of those projects start. We begin to ship a few of them. But we are still unclear as to the timing of a few others, and that's based on permit or engineering plans. So at this point, we need to see another quarter before we have real clarity on those big projects because when they go, a lot of them go really fast. So we still got some uncertainty on timing at this point.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just a couple of housekeeping questions, I think, mainly for John. Could you provide an update on your view on SG&A for the year, as well as depreciation costs?","John R. McPherson","Sure. On SG&A, we, of course, continue to manage it very, very tightly. We're very confident that we will be able to offset any normal increases in SG&A due to wage increases or those types of things with other savings. And so we'd expect it to be flat to down for the year. And equally importantly, we are very confident we will continue to leverage sales growth and profit growth through time. On -- does that answer your question?","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. And DD&A and then maybe interest as well.","John R. McPherson","DD&A and interest. DD&A we'd see as $265 million for the full year, and that reduction from last year, as a reminder, is largely due to the assets we divested. So that's $265 million versus I think $305 million last year. Interest expense would be in the range for the full year of $165 million to $170 million. The run rate reduction with our bond repurchase is about $32 million. And to save you asking, tax rate for the full year we see it at around 28%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","I appreciate the color that you had regarding the mix impact on pricing, but one thing I want to talk about a little bit is we look forward and knowing that you're going to have more infrastructure-related projects coming forward, how should we think about managing product mix in regard to modeling pricing, knowing that you're going to have a greater mix of base, which is a lower price point but you're still getting pricing on that. So if you could help us how we should think about that, not just for the upcoming quarter but over the next 12 to 24 months?","James Thomas Hill","This is Tom, Kathryn. I'll look back on that, we did not have a big impact on our first quarter for mix. And I think, we have -- going forward, I wouldn't see us having a substantial mix impact on pricing. I think, there's a pretty good balance there. I think, we have a handle on that. And while we will see some large base jobs, we are also going to see substantial concrete rock and asphalt rock work. So I don't see a big mix impact on price.","John R. McPherson","You talked a bit for margin also, right?","James Thomas Hill","Yes. That mix of business doesn't hurt our margin either.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. Great. And we've been following TIFIA for a bit now. Could you give a little bit more clarity on how much of TIFIA projects are being captured in your current volume guidance for the year? And it's difficult to put it in buckets on a percentage basis, but can you give a better sense of will it be more like 10% or 15% type this year or do you see more momentum into 2015? But in general, giving some sense of the relative mix and momentum of this TIFIA project as they ramp up?","James Thomas Hill","This is Tom again. Let me see if I can work you through some TIFIA jobs that we either have or have on the horizon. We have the Regional Connector in California, which is a small job. The Grand Parkway in Houston, which we talked about is a very large job, which will -- has started shipping and will impact this year. The I-4 expansion in Orlando is a job that just bid and was awarded. It's a little bit unclear of where the materials will go at this point and that job probably will not start until '15. The Northwest Corridor that we talked about in Atlanta, which is a very big job, the highway expansion in Atlanta that has an impact of about 1.4 million tons. But again, that will start shipping in late '14. The Midtown Tunnel in Northern Virginia, that job is around 800,000 tons, we are shipping that job currently. And in the Duluth [ph] Metro Rail in Northern Virginia, that's really a concrete job that we'll supply with our Northern Concrete group has an impact of about 140,000 to 150,000 cubic yards. So that gives you a view of what we know about right now. Most of those, we have secured. Some of them we'll ship this year. A lot of that we'll ship in 2015 and beyond. Does that answer your question?","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Yes, it is. It's really we're in a very, very early stages of seeing the volumes flow through, which is helpful.","James Thomas Hill","I think, that's right. It's early stages. And I think, when you look at large projects overall, and maybe back to Garik's question, what we have is we have much better visibility to the awards and to the backlogs and to our -- what we have left is those are 2 exact shipment dates. But the momentum in the overall demand is there and is growing and the question is just one of timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Quick question on the mix again. And Tom, I know you mentioned that you don't expect a real impact and didn't see a real impact as far as product mix goes on pricing. But geographic mix obviously had a little bit of impact in the first quarter. And then, you touched on these large energy projects coming up over the next few years in the Gulf. Also there's some port deepening and other activities going on in the Gulf as well. And with Florida being a pretty high-priced market relative to some, should we expect a positive mix impact from just geographic mix impact on pricing as we look over the next several quarters and the next year?","James Thomas Hill","The answer to your question is yes. Obviously, we're hit hard on the East Coast with weather in the first quarter. That will catch up. As that catches up, it will have a positive impact on price. Also Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which have attractive pricing, as their markets come back, and as the Florida market comes back, we will see positive impact on pricing.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","But just specifically to some of the activity in the Gulf, do you think that those will be priced as such that will -- you'll be able to realize more of that price impact or mix impact, I guess, as these big, large projects come in? Just trying to get a sense for how you think those are going to be situated?","James Thomas Hill","I think, those are at attractive prices. And I think, they will have a positive impact on pricing.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, also, kind of on that note, I'm assuming a lot of that, with all the activity in the Gulf, a lot of that would be coming from the Yucat\u00e1n, a lot of that product. So how should we think about margins on that rock? Would they be any different than typical coming out of the Yucat\u00e1n?","James Thomas Hill","Those are very attractive margins and they will help us.","Donald M. James","And Trey, on the point, we have a very significant competitive advantage on projects on the Gulf Coast because it's a straight shot, as you know, up from our quarry on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. And so those are really good projects for us both in terms of pricing and margin.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It seems like you guys are set up nicely to benefit from those.","John R. McPherson","Trey, one more slightly different point on geographic mix, just worth noting for the group. In our -- again, as Tom mentioned, our Virginia, Maryland markets, and through the Carolinas really were hit by weather. And just to give you a sound bite on that, our ready-mix volumes in Virginia, Maryland were down 19% versus the prior year. They're up everywhere else. And so it obviously impacted our results significantly in that segment for the quarter. But just to give you a sense, Tom had mentioned how we had half the shipping days go away in Virginia and Maryland. And so that will rebound as we go through the year. But you shouldn't lose that as a driver of mix and as a driver of concrete segment performance in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the large-scale infrastructure projects that are likely to move towards TIFIA financing? Is your visibility and lead times better than it's been in prior cycles? We're hearing from some contractors that their jobs for mid to late '15 that already visibility is pretty good on, which would be much earlier, I guess, than the typical bid cycle than prior cycles. I'm wondering if you're seeing that as well. And then, just based on the project flow, can you talk about, with a rough sense, of what proportion of your aggregate shipments in '15 and '16 could ultimately be towards TIFIA-related projects?","Donald M. James","Jerry, we are -- continue to be very active in monitoring and working with potential contractors on the large TIFIA projects. The substantial majority of those projects are in our footprint and the reason for that simply is these have to be revenue-generating projects. And many of them are toll roads. And in order to get the traffic counts necessary to generate the revenue stream to support the TIFIA financing, you have to be in large, congested metropolitan areas. So California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Illinois, those are where most of the big TIFIA projects are located, which happen to be fortunately markets where we have very substantial positions. So we think we will get more than our fair share of the TIFIA projects. And as I said, we want to work very closely with the contractors in order to help them achieve the best value for the aggregates and other heavy materials and products in markets where we have those on those projects. That being said, and I think, Tom took you through a list of the ones that we currently have booked or active and working on, that's a very important part of our future demand. It is not possible for us to tell you today what portion of our projected shipments in '14, '15 or '16 don't go to TIFIA projects because we simply don't know what the timing of those projects is going to be or the level of our participation. We won't get every TIFIA project in our footprint because we have competitive markets wherever we operate. But it will be a significant boost to our volume. But in order to try to give you the kind of specificity as to what percentage growth will be in each of the next 3 years on TIFIA projects, we simply don't have the data to do that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it does sound like the visibility has improved, as you pointed out, we've all been waiting for those projects to get moving and it sounds like it's finally starting to play out.","Donald M. James","It is. And they've been slow coming out of the U.S. DOT. Part of it was the shift from -- as you know, under the statute, the federal government could provide up to 49% of the total financing. Because the number of projects was substantially oversubscribed, the DOT and the Treasury decided they would cut back maximum participation to about 33%. So some of the projects had to go back and redo their financing in order to meet that 33% test. That's been one of the issues. And just the fact that there was a huge increase in TIFIA, and therefore, a huge increase in the number of projects submitted to the DOT has certainly slowed the process of review and approval. But as we have noted and you have noted, finally, under the new MAP-21 version of TIFIA, which dramatically increased the federal support there, that we're seeing those beginning to materialize.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, from a capital deployment standpoint, you've obviously reduced leverage pretty aggressively here. How should we think about capital deployment from here? Anything to do before your December 2015 notes become due?","John R. McPherson","Nothing to do before the notes come due. We'll likely pay those off as they come due out of operating cash flow. I think, the answer to your question, as we noted in our remarks, is that we are very well positioned to pursue growth opportunities as they arise. We'll be disciplined in how we do that. But we think there's a real opportunity in the market these days to smartly grow our footprint and our franchise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Don and Tom, you guys have both talked about the growth in residential communities, which I guess, were basically dead for a while and are now coming back. Can you talk about whether that community development activity is picking up and how far away you think we might be from reaching kind of parity where, I guess, we're developing a lot for every lot we're building on?","Donald M. James","I'll give you one small example. I was in San Antonio last week with our management team and there's lot development going on everywhere. I think, the same thing is happening in Phoenix and Atlanta, lot of other markets, as Tom mentioned, Nashville and Charlotte. I don't have any metrics to say that we will reach equilibrium in lot development and home starts by day X. But at this point, I think, you've seen the statistics that say house prices are moving up sharply in most markets because the inventory levels of new homes are dramatically reduced. You know what incentive that creates for homebuilders. They need lots to build new houses to meet the demand and we're seeing a tremendous amount of lot development. It's very geographically specific, but it's all based on the markets where there's population growth, household formation, job creation. That's been a big driver.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Is it fair to say, as people, I guess, that worried a little bit this spring about exactly where the starts are and the traffic is, that this is a phenomenon and a trend that's a little longer-term, takes longer to develop the communities. So does it feel a little more durable than maybe the more volatile housing statistics?","Donald M. James","Well, I think, we take a fair amount of comfort in the fact that we're still plus or minus 1 million housing starts a year. And so the average over the last, whatever, 30, 40 years has been 1.4 million, 1.5 million. So we're -- housing starts, before they even get to a normalized run rate level, have to go up another 50%. And there got to be lots for those houses to be built on. So there's a lot of noise from month to month and week to week about housing starts and home sales. But when you back up and look at it over the longer term, we're very bullish on housing, particularly given our geographic footprint and the population statistics in our states. One of -- for example, the demographers are now saying Florida has now surpassed New York in population. So Florida has been very strong for us for at least the last 18 months in terms of recovery. It got hit, as you know, dramatically in the downturn. But I think, we are very bullish about housing and don't get distracted by reports about this, that and the other that come out every week about housing. We just think the long-term supply\/demand in our markets is very favorable for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Vix [ph] with Jeffries.","Unknown Analyst","I have 3 or 4 pretty short questions, hopefully. The first one was the states that had over 15% growth, I was surprised that Illinois was in that state, although you have referred to it briefly in some of the other comments. Could you kind of just summarize why you think that market is so strong? Secondly, I noticed in terms of leverage now, you're looking at net debt to EBITDA. Could you talk about where you'd be targeting in the longer term for that ratio to be? And therefore, give us some idea of the size of corporate activity that you might be looking at? And then, just finally, the ready-mix, obviously, was distorted by Maryland and Virginia, as you mentioned, but it's also distorted by the Florida divestment. Do you have any kind of like-for-like volume change excluding Florida you could give us for the quarter, and did it also have a significant impact on the ready-mix price?","James Thomas Hill","Mike, this is Tom. I'll start off with Illinois. As I said in my comments, we have secured a number of very large projects in Illinois that will last throughout the year. So we're pleased with our performance in Illinois and confident that those markets will improve as the year goes along.","Unknown Analyst","And there was no weather impact in Illinois?","James Thomas Hill","I'm sorry?","Unknown Analyst","There was no negative weather impact in Illinois?","James Thomas Hill","There was bad weather impact. But the large projects, when they were able to ship, they shipped strong.","John R. McPherson","I think, our guys on the ground are just doing a good job winning the work, too, and gaining share. Mike, on your question on balance sheet, we use any number of metrics, we just used this particular one to illustrate the improvement. As stated, our longer-term through cycle goal is to return to investment-grade metrics. It's really less about the metrics and more about the ability to pursue growth smartly throughout the entire cycle, which is what we're focused on. As we sit here today, our view is that we have plenty of firepower and financial flexibility to pursue those options that make sense for us and I think that's a function of both the balance sheet, but, Mike, also the really strong margins and unit economics that we're able to generate from the business, the strength of our operations and sales teams. So we don't see financial constraints in what we do, it's more a question of the opportunities and which ones make sense.","Donald M. James","Mike, on your question on ready-mix, I think, John has already mentioned that our ready-mix in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia, which is one of our best ready-mix markets, was down about 19% due to weather in the quarter. Everywhere else, we were up, on average, at least double-digits. California, Texas and Georgia. We had very good ready-mix shipments in the quarter year-over-year growth. We are projecting that our ready-mix segment becomes profitable in 2015, part of that is growth in margin and volume and price. Part of it is not having the Florida business as part of our mix going forward. So we think ready-mix will benefit greatly from the growth in housing, and to some extent, growth in private non-res construction. If you've been to Washington DC lately or -- you see huge amount of private non-res construction there in terms of office buildings and high-rise condos in the district, as well as in Northern Virginia, and that's a very strong market for us, all we need there is a little weather.","John R. McPherson","Mike, just to give you another sound bite, the concrete businesses we retained, some asset that we've divested, would have been up on volume, I think, 1.4% for the quarter, and that's despite what is by far our largest position, Virginia, Maryland being down 19%. So the increases in the other markets are very strong. We have increases in pricing, increases in material margins across each of these businesses, and I think, all indicative of the recovery in private residential activity. So we're bullish on it. And obviously, the weather impact in Northern Virginia will reverse itself. I think, if you look at the gross profit mix relative to the expectations in our concrete segment for the quarter, it is almost entirely explained by the volume decline in Northern Virginia, which again, will reverse itself.","Unknown Analyst","Is that a high-margin market for you?","John R. McPherson","We have a very good position in that market. That's a good concrete market, arguably our highest-margin market.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.

My name is Brandy, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn this call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. James, you may begin.","Donald M. James","Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2013 results. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials. Joining me today are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during the call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's first quarter 2013 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.","Turning now to Slide 3. I want to begin by briefly discussing a few highlights from the quarter. Our business segments performed in line with our expectations in the first quarter, and thus we have reaffirmed our outlook and remain on track to achieve earnings improvements in 2013. Gross profit of $18 million was $4 million lower than the prior year's first quarter, which benefited from unseasonable warm and dry weather, and this year's gross profit was $25 million higher than the first quarter of 2011.","Aggregate segment gross profit, while down versus the prior year, was in line with our expectations and better than 2011. Aggregate shipments were 5% lower than the prior year and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2011, which like 2013 was subject to more typical winter weather. The timing of large projects in a number of markets also affected the year-over-year comparison.","We achieved broad-based improvement in aggregates pricing, which was up 5% overall, helping to offset the earnings effect of lower volumes. Our reported price improvement is adjusted for freight cost incurred in transport aggregates from the producing quarry to the sales yard. We believe measuring our price improvement in this way provides a clearer view of changes in actual realized prices. Without this freight adjustment, our year-over-year price improvement was even higher than our reported number.","Over a year -- on a year-over-year basis, our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton has continued to increase despite the 5% decline in first quarter shipments. We believe this demonstrates the benefits of improved pricing, as well as our initiative to increase operating efficiency and reduce cost.","Volumes in ready-mixed concrete and cement increased 6% and 14%, respectively, due to improving levels of private construction. Both Florida and Texas delivered improvements in ready-mixed volumes, exceeding 20%. Collectively, non-aggregates gross profit improved $5 million to a loss of $7 million.","Cost-reduction continues to be an ongoing focus of our management team and all of our employees. As we look ahead, we remain encouraged by improving trends in private sector construction. These positive trends bode well for not only earnings growth in our aggregates business but also earnings improvement in our non-aggregate segments, which are located in high-growth markets.","We are also pleased to see contract awards for public highways, a leading indicator of future construction activity, turned positive in the first quarter for the first time in 2 years.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Danny Shepherd who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter. Danny?","Danny R. Shepherd","Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 4, you can see how the weather played a significant role in the year-over-year comparisons. The unseasonably mild winter weather in last year's first quarter, coupled with some above-average participation this year in a number of our East Coast and central U.S. markets distorted the year-over-year comparisons. The absence of comparable large industrial and infrastructure projects in the Midwest, Tennessee and Virginia also contributed to the 16% decline in the East Coast and central U.S. markets.","Turning to Slide 5, you see that despite 5% lower volumes in the first quarter, our trailing 12 months cash gross profit per ton of aggregates increased 2%. Overall, we expected our first quarter aggregate shipments to be lower than last year when shipments increased 10% due to favorable weather, as well as the timing of shipments to serve our large projects. However, despite overall lower volumes, we were pleased to see aggregate shipments in a few key states such as Arizona, California and Florida, showing strength, increasing by at least 10% versus the prior year. Florida alone experienced a 25% increase in aggregate shipments during the first quarter, benefiting from recovery in private construction activity, particularly in the residential market. Other key markets, such as Texas, continue to benefit from broad-based demand growth across all end-use markets. Sales volumes at the company's remotely served sales yards along the central Gulf Coast also benefited from stronger demand, increasing approximately 25% versus the prior year. Unfavorable weather, lower production levels and a geographic mix shift impacted year-over-year cash cost comparisons. As an example of the distortion caused by geographic mix, let's take my comment about sales volume growth along the central Gulf Coast and apply it to cost. The unit cost of sales at remotely served sales yards is higher than at a producing quarry because of the freight and handling cost incurred to transfer aggregates from the producing quarry to the yard. As a result, the 25% sales increase, along the central Gulf Coast I just mentioned, stands in stark contrast to our volumes inside Tennessee and Kentucky, where volumes collectively declined 25%. These mid-south markets are truck-served from producing quarries and therefore carry a lower unit cost structure than a sales yard, creating the unfavorable geographic mix impact for both unit cost and total cost. Additionally, production levels were reduced to match sales levels. Notwithstanding the lower first quarter shipments across many markets, our operating managers did an excellent job of balancing production with sales and holding inventory levels essentially flat. While these management decisions had a negative effect on GAAP earnings and EBITDA in the quarter, it positions us to run our plants at efficient levels in the second and third quarters and more than recover these lost earnings. I'm pleased to say that our employees did a nice job of maintaining productivity, as measured by tons per manhour given the lower production levels. Year-over-year, this metric of production efficiency essentially remained unchanged.","Unit production cost increased slightly from the prior year, due mostly to repairs and maintenance. Plant period costs were down versus the prior year. In a number of locations, the cost variance was caused by planned cash cost in the quarter for routine expenditures necessary to prepare for the start of seasonal construction activity. We did have new operation that were not counted in the prior year.","Finally, as Don mentioned, we benefited from broad-based price improvement, with virtually all of the company's markets realizing higher pricing versus the prior year, which helped offset the earnings effect of lower volumes and the unfavorable geographic mix.","Turning to Slide 6 for an update on performance of non-aggregates for the quarter, we're continuing to see concrete and cement volumes recover from cyclical lows. Concrete and cement volumes were up 6% and 14%, respectively. These 2 segments are benefiting from increased private construction activity, particularly in Florida.","Concrete segment gross profit improved $2 million, due in part to a 6% increase in shipments and after absorbing higher input cost for aggregates and cement.","Cement segment gross profit in the first quarter was $1 million, up slightly versus the prior year.","Asphalt mix segment gross profit improved by approximately $3 million despite a 4% decline in shipments. Unit profitability, as measured by material margins, increased 19% due in part to a 7% decrease in unit cost of liquid asphalt.","In total, gross profit for our non-aggregate segment improved $5 million to a loss of $7 million.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Don.","Donald M. James","Thanks, Danny. If you'll turn now to Slide 7, you'll see that we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction. Net debt declined 6% over the last year, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved from 7.5 as of March 2011 to 6.4 this year all throughout a meaningful recovery yet in demand for aggregates.","After a payment of a scheduled debt maturity of $140 million in June of this year, which we'll make from our existing liquidity, we will have no debt due until the fourth quarter of 2015. Strengthening our balance sheet remains a top priority for our management team.","Turning now to Slide 8 for our end markets. Housing starts measured on the seasonally adjusted annual rate are now at more than 1 million, indicating the beginnings of a broad-based recovery in residential construction. In fact, most well-conserved markets realized double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12 months. More importantly, we are seeing significant growth in several key states, including Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona. Growth in these key well-conserved states is important because not only will we realize the attractive incremental margins from higher aggregates volume, but our non-aggregates businesses will benefit as well. This growth in residential construction activity and its traditional follow-on impact to private nonresidential construction underpins our expectations for volumes and earnings improvements in 2013. Our April concrete shipments are indicative of this expanding recovery in private construction. For the past month, our concrete shipments were up over 20% compared to April of 2012, led by Florida, which was up over 30%. Year-to-date concrete shipments are slightly ahead of our year-to-date plan.","Moving on to Slide 9. We are also continuing to be encouraged by leading indicators of future construction activity for private nonresidential buildings. One leading indicator, the Architectural Billing Index, or ABI, has been showing signs of steadily increased activity. The ABI can be an important leading indicator of construction for private nonresidential buildings. As you'll see on this slide, for 8 consecutive months, the ABI has been above 50, a level that indicates an increase in billing activity. This is a promising sign as we move further into 2012.","Turning now to Slide 10. Private construction contract awards continue to recover in our markets, which includes contract awards for nonresidential buildings shown here. As shown in this chart, U.S. private nonresidential contract awards for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2013, are up 16% from the prior year period. This growth should support increased aggregate demand and private construction well into the future.","Moving now to highway construction activity on Slide 11. You can see the year-over-year change in contract awards for new construction and construction put in place. As you'll see from this chart, the passage of the federal highway bill, or MAP-21, in July of 2012, is finally providing stability and predictability to highway funding. New highway projects, as measured by trailing 12 month contract awards, were up 1% versus last year's first quarter, marking the first year-over-year increase in contract awards for highways since January of 2011.","The large increase in TIFIA funding contained in the new highway bill should also positively impact future demand. Contract awards for TIFIA projects are projected to add $30 billion to $50 billion to highway and infrastructure construction, substantially exceeding the contract awards for highways from the 2009 stimulus bill shown on the graph here from 2009 through 2010.","Additionally, state and local governments appear to be moving forward with funding initiatives over and above the federal programs. Key states, such as Virginia, Texas and Maryland, are pursuing new funding initiatives that should increase future transportation investments substantially.","In Virginia, a 5-year funding package approved by the general assembly can generate $3.4 billion for highways over the next 5 years, an increase of about $780 million per year. In Texas, the Department of Transportation has remained committed to bidding approximately $8.8 billion in transportation projects in FY '13 compared to about $4.8 billion last year.","In Maryland, new revenue measures have been enacted that could raise $4.4 billion over 6 years, an increase of about $100 million to $200 million per year over that period.","And finally, Richland County, South Carolina, home of the state capital in Columbia and the University of South Carolina where we have a substantial presence, is an example of a local government addressing their infrastructure needs beyond the state and federal program. In that County, a 1% sales tax increase was approved that will yield $35 million to $50 million per year the next 20 years. That tax goes into effect next month, or this month, actually.","Turning now to Slide 12. Our outlook for another year of operating earnings improvements remains on track and it's supported by improved pricing, cost management and continued growth in private construction activity, which should drive volume growth.","Aggregates demand from private construction is expected to grow overall, led by the residential sector. Residential construction is expected to increase approximately 20%, while demand from private nonresidential buildings is expected to increase about 8% compared to 2012.","Our current expectation is for aggregates demand in the public construction, including highways and other infrastructure to approximate 2012 levels. However, our outlook for this end market has improved modestly given the recent upturn in trailing 12-month highway contract awards. The projects that could materially impact our 2013 aggregates volumes include a disproportionately greater number of large discrete highway and industrial projects. The timing of these projects remains challenging to predict.","Our year-to-date aggregate shipments through April are slightly ahead of our year-to-date plan, and our full year shipments in 2013 are expected to increase 1% to 5%, with most of the expected year-over-year growth to occur in the second half of the year.","In keeping with our successful efforts to offset the earnings effect of lower volumes in recent quarters, we will continue our focus on reducing controllable cost and achieving improved pricing. The geographic breadth of pricing gains we achieved in 2012 and so far this year enforces our expectation for continued price growth in 2013. We expect full year adjusted -- freight adjusted price growth of approximately 4% for full year 2013. Additionally, we expect earnings in each of our non-aggregates segments to improve compared to last year. Asphalt material margins increased throughout 2012, and we expect these material margins to increase again in 2013 and contribute to earnings growth in this segment.","Full year concrete volumes and material margins are expected to improve in 2013 as housing starts continue recovering in key states. As we've noted, concrete volumes in the first quarter increased 6% overall versus the prior year, due in part to increased private construction activity in Florida. We expect the increased private construction activity to continue to lead to improved unit profitability in the Concrete segment.","Demand earnings should also improve in 2013 due mostly to lower production cost. As a result, collectively, full year earnings from these segments are expected to contribute significantly to our earnings growth in 2013.","Our full year outlook for 2013 reflects our continued progress toward achieving our Profit Enhancement Plan goals. Through the first quarter of 2013, profit enhancement initiatives have generated approximately $55 million of run rate profitability improvements. And we remain on track to meet our target of $100 million in run rate improvements from the 2011 base year.","Finally, we will continue to work on additional asset sales, transactions that allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics, as well as to deploy capital into assets and markets with higher future returns, to increase our ability to improve earnings as construction activity rose.","And with that, I'll now turn the meeting back over to our operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","On the pricing, it's a question we've been asking all of our aggregate contacts, but how much of the price increase benefited from mix versus a pure price increase? And also to get set further, what was the pricing improvement in your strongest markets and in your weakest markets?","Donald M. James","Kathryn, I think of the 5% price increase we enjoyed in the first quarter, about 1% of that is mix and the rest is through same-store price increases. You ask about the range of price increases, I think increasingly, we are seeing price growth across virtually all of our markets. The range is really 10% into 12% and then a market or 2, it's probably down 5% or less, but there's a broad range. But virtually, every market was up. Typically, the markets where there is a price decline is because of a special project or some initiative that we did intentionally.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. And just to reconfirm, your -- the states with the highest per unit price are the Carolinas, Georgia, California and Florida?","Donald M. James","Well, the East Coast, the entire East Coast is a strong pricing market. The Gulf Coast is a strong pricing market, but of course, as Danny Shepherd said, our unit cost on the Gulf Coast are higher because of the freight. But these are freight adjusted prices, so the shipments into the Gulf Coast, including Florida and Texas, are good markets, and California are good markets from a price standpoint. So our whole coastal business from our southern tier from Florida to California is good pricing, the whole East Coast is good pricing. The weakness is in the Midwest.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Faults in the midyear price increase?","Donald M. James","Kathryn, as we try to say, we don't do big lump sum one-time midyear price increases. We have boots on the ground, and we try to move prices wherever and whenever we have the opportunity.","Operator","Your next question is from Trey Grooms with Stevens.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just kind of touching on non-res. Are you guys seeing and I may have missed it in your prepared comments, but are you seeing any tangible evidence of non-res, new non-res, specifically kind of commercial and the more cyclical stuff, see any improvement there, any intangible evidence of that? And I understand the ABI is kind of pointing that, that could start to improve pretty nicely at some point maybe this year, but just if you are seeing it, where to?","Donald M. James","It depends on your definition of non-res. If you're including industrial projects, we're seeing a lot of industrial projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast, refineries, airbus and Mobile, chemical plant expansions. There's a lot of industrial work in the queue. In terms of buildings, I think our concrete shipments are some indication that there is a recovery underway in certain markets, at least, in private non-res buildings, while concrete shipments are driven by housing starts, there's also a fair amount of that concrete shipment increase that's going to private non-res buildings. So the private construction is really the driver of concrete, much more so than public, and we're seeing big increases as we've indicated in concrete shipments.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then I asked one of your competitors the same question here yesterday or a few days ago but I'd like to get your take on it, Don, as far as kind of looking out longer-term, with all of the things kind of looking into '14, it looks like it could really drive some good volume for you guys and in my opinion I think -- I'm not looking for any guidance on this front, but it doesn't seem unrealistic to see some very nice volume improvements next year, maybe even double digits. And if that were the case, hypothetically, as we look forward, how does your pricing kind of correspond with volume given kind of where we are in the cycle right now as we look forward?","Donald M. James","Well, McGraw  -- and I won't give you any bulk on specific guidance for '14 and '15, but you probably have seen the McGraw-Hill numbers that came out the last few days. McGraw-Hill is seeing total construction activity up 18% in 2014 and 20% above that in 2015. So we concur based on the data we see, that construction is going to come back after this 5-year recession we have had. Included within the McGraw-Hill numbers are residential improvement of 14% and 22% in '14 and '15 -- I mean, residential is 36% and 26%. Non-res is 14% and 22%. So there's a lot of optimism there and it is supported, obviously, by contract award data. It's not a theoretical increase, it's real in terms of the contract awards that are coming out. Clearly, Trey, if you look at the relationship of volume growth to price growth for our company, and really for the industry, but particularly for our company, you see that when volumes start moving up significantly so that the visibility of future demand is out there, as well as maybe some of the smaller local players in the market booking up with volume, we have tremendous pricing power. The last time we were seeing substantial volume growth in 2004, '05, '06 and '07, we were averaging double-digit price growth. I'm not predicting that, but that's certainly within the range of possible outcomes.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. Just on the SAG line, I was curious what you were thinking relative to 2012 what you're expecting for SAG dollars and for 2013. And then...","Donald M. James","Our full year SAG expectation right now is about flat, slightly down from 2012, but essentially flat. We are hoping to improve on that, but our current outlook is essentially flat. There's a lot of ups and downs in that. I would say on what we might call controllable cost, they're down. Some costs like benefits cost, where it's tougher to control them in the near-term, are up. So there's some offsets going on there.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I also want to get a sense of what you're seeing in the market in terms of the opportunity for potential asset sales this year. And then it looks like you made an acquisition in the quarter, if you could also talk about that, too.","Donald M. James","Yes. We bought 2 quarries in Georgia from Lafarge. We're very pleased to close that deal. We are operating, making improvements, integrating them with our existing operations. We continue to look for bolt-on opportunities in markets where we think there's good growth potential and which -- and where the acquisition of a bolt-on, not only can we hopefully improve its operations, but we would achieve overhead synergies and cost synergies and the ability to serve our customers better in those markets. So we continue to work on those transactions. We also continue to look at our portfolio, and when we see places where we have capital tied up that does not have the kind of upside we're seeing in the rest of our markets, we are certainly prepared to exit those markets looking for that capital. And that's an ongoing process. Danny Shepherd and our 3 regional SVPs are very focused on that process. That's nothing new for us, but given now the outlook for the next several years in construction growth, particularly in certain of our key markets we are really -- we're pursuing those. Obviously, having willing sellers has helped us.","Operator","Your next question is from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was hoping to talk about pep and as a starting point, I know you mentioned the $55 million of run rate savings realized through the end of 1Q. Can you just remind us sequentially kind of what the -- how 4Q compared to 1Q?","Donald M. James","I'm going to get Danny Shepherd. He and the SVPs are our pep gurus. Could you repeat the question for Danny, please?","Danny R. Shepherd","I think I heard the question. Well, as Don said in his remarks, he referred to the $55 million number. We believe that in 2013 we will have achieved $75 million in pep improvements, and we believe that we will deliver, as we've promised, the $100 million in 2014. And we will be at a run rate of $100 million at some point in 2013.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So what I'm trying to understand initially is the run rate were at $55 million, kind of sequentially what changed and how that rate improved, I'm assuming?","Donald M. James","I really can't comment on that and answer that question. I can really only tell you that we're at the $75 million run rate now.","Danny R. Shepherd","Ted, this is Dan. We've got tracking on that, but I don't think we have the data parsed the way you phrased your question right in front of us, so we'd be probably guessing but we can come back and if it's important and flesh that out. It's all part of our tracking, we just didn't slice it the way you framed your question.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure, okay. That's great, we can swirl back on it. Maybe thinking about the opportunities in front of us for the remainder of the calendar year, just dividing those between whether it's sourcing or plant operations or logistics, where do we expect to get the biggest gains incrementally in calendar 2013?","Donald M. James","I can answer that. We are making good progress on procurement savings, and our transportation initiatives are really gaining momentum. We are now achieving both revenue and cost savings in several parts of the country as a result of the plans that we put in place. That's both in trucking, rail. We're making good progress.","Danny R. Shepherd","And, Ted, to maybe add on to that, we expect the bulk of the incremental savings for the rest of this year to be in the areas Danny just described. In contrast, we have achieved most of the savings that we had targeted in SG&A costs. There's still some incremental amounts that are going to flow through during the course of 2013, but the bulk of the SAG or overhead-related savings have already been put in place, but again there are some additional actions that will occur during the course of the year but the largest dollar magnitude yet to come lies in sourcing and transportation and logistics.","Donald M. James","Ted, I'll give you one other example of the fact that the original plan has evolved to reflect what's going on in the marketplace. For example, one of our transportation cost savings was to run our ships at lower speeds, which would allow us to save a few million dollars in fuel costs. With the big ramp-up in demand across the entire Gulf Coast in Florida, we are now having to run our ships wide open 100% in service of moving our rock from our Mexican quarry to our yards along the Gulf Coast and in Florida. And as a result of that, we're not going to be able to save that $3 million or $4 million in freight -- in fuel cost, but the margin on those incremental sales just overwhelms all of that. So to take what we set out 15 months ago and reconcile it where we are today, there are some moving pieces there. And we're making those adjustments as we need to improve our overall profit growth.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the last thing I was hoping to ask you is on the divestiture side, kind of the update, I know we've been targeting something on the order of $500 million from start to finish by mid-2013. Can you just let us know kind of where the process stands and how we feel about the goalposts?","Danny R. Shepherd","Ted, this is Danny Shepherd. We're making progress on the -- on our goal. Hopefully, within the next few months, we'll have something positive to report. Obviously, we can't be specific at this point, but we are focused on our divestiture program and believe that we have a reasonably good shot of achieving what we've told you.","Operator","Your next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the context of your full year aggregates volume guidance, I'm wondering if you could talk about how you expect the year to play out sequentially. Obviously we had really tough weather comps in the first quarter, and I'm wondering how do you see the seasonality playing out this year compared to last year and perhaps if you're willing to touch on how April volume trends stacked up.","Donald M. James","Jerry, to hit our guidance of 1 to 5 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we need to be up about 3% to about 7.5% given the first quarter shipments. That's just a math problem. We expect, because of the existence of some large projects that are in the pipeline, we expect there to be pretty hefty second half contribution to that total aggregate volume. That's simply because some of these TIFIA projects will kick off hopefully sometime in the second half of the year plus some of these industrial projects on the Gulf Coast. Some of the TIFIA projects have already started, some of the industrial projects have started, but there's much more in the pipeline. So the timing of whether those shipments are in the second half of '13 or they roll over into the first half of '14 is difficult for us to predict, but our base load business, our base load business is improving, certainly, as you can see. And then our aggregates, we are obviously behind on year-to-date shipments compared to our guidance but we're right on our plan.","Danny R. Shepherd","We're behind on year-to-date versus last year, not to our guidance.","Donald M. James","Right, right, right. So we're reasonably confident we will hit our guidance. We hope to be able to narrow that guidance for you after the second quarter after we are able to see the timing of some of these larger projects.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on the acquired quarries from Lafarge in Georgia, can you just talk about the size of the reserve and how the pricing point compares to overall Vulcan pricing?","Danny R. Shepherd","Yes. This is Danny Shepherd again. First of all, we are well pleased with the reserve position that we were able to acquire. In addition to the existing reserves, there are reserves that we can add to this property, and I'm giving you a range, 30, 40 years is certainly what we believed -- we believe is -- can be described as proven and probable. And there are -- there's another body of reserves that would add significantly to the proven and probable reserves. So we're pleased with the reserve position. As to the pricing question, the -- it's hard to say exactly what our pricing position will be. We're certainly pleased that we've added it to our Atlanta market, but I really can't comment on the specifics of pricing for you. But we're pleased with the acquisition. It fits us perfectly, and we're well pleased.","Donald M. James","Those 2 -- the 2 quarries, Jerry, that we acquired are in the northeast quadrant of Atlanta where we were unable to serve the market. So they helped fill our hand out in terms of the geographic market that we can supply.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, I'm wondering if you could talk about pricing conditions that you're seeing from your customers of ready-mix and asphalt industries, are they able to put through accelerating price increases on the finished products at this point?","Donald M. James","We saw very modest price growth in ready-mix in the first quarter, and in terms of asphalt pricing, essentially flat. The story in asphalt though is with the declining in the price -- decline in the price of liquid asphalt, our margins are improving. But the first quarter is not the indicative of what the full year is likely to be for any number of reasons, particularly in asphalt, because of the weather situation. But on balance, we think we'll see price improvement in concrete and we certainly expect to see margin improvement in asphalt.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what about for your customers in areas where you're not vertically integrated there? Do you have a sense of their ability to get price increase to stick?","Donald M. James","We certainly hope so and we think given the increasing demand in residential and private non-res, this is the time they need to be getting price improvement and certainly, that's a decision they make, we don't make, but I think the stage is set for pricing growth, particularly in concrete.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My question relates to concrete. Is there any sort of metric you can give us in terms of tons or pricing or anything like that? Would you think this will cross back over into profitability and the gross profit line?","Donald M. James","It's largely about volume, Keith. We need to be able to run our plants and our trucks steadily and consistently. We also need some price growth, but volume is the key right now for recovery and profitability in the Concrete business. Our Concrete businesses are -- the profitability differs greatly from market to market. Some markets are profitable, some aren't. But the growth in demand, particularly in Florida, I think, bodes well for opportunity for profit improvement there.","Danny R. Shepherd","Is it 30% above where we are before this quarter or is there a metric...?","Daniel F. Sansone","I don't have that calculation in front of me, but -- and I don't think -- Danny, you don't have that data in front of you either, but I can't give you that metric. We will certainly look back at our numbers and our projections and can fill in that blank for you later.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Betts with Jefferies.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had kind of 3 areas of questions, if I could, very quickly. Firstly, in the EBITDA bridge, the $19 million of increased costs and other, we know $4 million is due to repairs and maintenance. Is there any way of kind of splitting what the rest is? And related to that, is that repair and maintenance a timing issue or should we regard it as just an increased cost that you're going to face as volumes start to pick up? That's my first question. The second one to give you, just to help, you're talking in the press release about your objectives for costs this year or your cash cost objectives for 2013. Can you remind me, did you say what they were and have they changed given a bigger volume is coming potentially from the Gulf Coast area? And then just finally on that Gulf Coast market, presumably, that's likely to be strong for the foreseeable future, but it has implications for profitability. I know prices are higher there but is there a scope to put through more substantial price increases to offset the impact on profitability?","Donald M. James","Mike, let me first approach the question about the Gulf Coast. As Danny said in his remarks, our unit cost of sales is higher there because of the embedded freight and handling. We also have very strong pricing there, and we have really good margins in that business. So we're perfectly happy to incur the higher cost structure because those shipments come with very high profitability and we report freight adjusted pricing, so we take the freight out of the reported pricing on the Gulf Coast. So with respect to the Gulf Coast, we are really happy with the way things are going. As I told you, our ships are now going full blast all across the markets from Florida to Texas, and that's good. With respect to the cost in the quarter, and I'll ask my colleagues, but generally, there are -- you picked up the R&M, which prepares us for the improving production volumes in Q2 and Q3 that Danny referenced. There is a weather impact there, and there is a geographic mix there, and I'll ask Dan to fill in the blanks on that.","Daniel F. Sansone","Mike, if you take the $19 million in that EBITDA bridge, I think we can drop that into 4 buckets. First bucket we would characterize as cost that have been affected by either weather or mix, meaning geographic mix throughout the network, and that's about $6 million of the increased cost. Second category or bucket into which we would categorize some of this cost is what we would call seasonal timing or -- and that would include -- and that's about $7 million, and that's the parts and supply and repairs and a few other items that are really costs that were going to be spent in the course of 2013 and it's really a timing issue.","[indiscernible] of what I would call true cost increases where we have structural increases in costs. For example, we have one site where the minimum royalty obligation stepped-up contractually from 1 year to the next and a few other items, and that's about $2 million. And then about $4 million is referable to the higher volumes that are flowing through the distribution yards which carry the incremental freight and handling costs associated with it. So if you add those 4 categories up, you get to the $19 million.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And that's really helpful. Just the one other one. Have you shared with us what your cash cost objectives are for 2013?","Daniel F. Sansone","No.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Would you like to?","Donald M. James","Well, we have given volume and price guidance. We haven't given EBITDA guidance or cost guidance. Once we get into a more normalized production environment in the second quarter, I think that becomes easier. You shouldn't, for any number of reasons, and you've been in this industry as long as any of us, you shouldn't draw very many conclusions from first quarter performance, good or bad, for the full year. It's just too much variation, particularly with weather. And this year, the weather had a very significant geographic mix effect as well, which is not typical in this industry.","Suffice it to say, we have a full fledged focus on cost management throughout the organization from the plant, all the way up through the entire organization. But we have not given guidance on what we expect our cash cost will be in 2013.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Olin with Cleveland Research.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Just wanted to talk a little bit about your Mexican quarry and kind of going back to what you said regarding your ships. It seems like that facility could be one of the big drivers of the growth given where the pockets of the demand seem to be developing, Florida, Gulf Coast. I'm just wondering if you can give us updates, kind of where that plant stands in terms of utilization. And you mention the ships running full, I'm just wondering if that's any kind of constraint and would you need to invest in that asset to capitalize on some of the future growth.","Donald M. James","With respect to -- our plant capacity there is about 12 million tons. We are not at capacity. We still got a couple of million tons of capacity available. Our ship capacity is 9 million tons, and we have contracts with another carrier who has self-unloading vessels that will allow us. So shipping is not a constraint. Production capacity currently is not a constraint, but we certainly have the ability to ramp up our capacity at that plant very efficiently when we see future demand exceeding capacity of the plant. We have plans in place, the engineering work is done, cost estimates are done, it's just a matter of when we pull the trigger based on demand. And you're right, the -- that product from that quarry fits the growing demand beautifully. Its premier product is concrete rock and that concrete rock can make cement -- I mean, can make concrete with slightly lower cement levels than much of the other concrete rock that's sold in the United States. Secondly, the big industrial projects along the Gulf Coast require huge amounts of base to start with, and that is the other premier product coming out of that. So base and concrete rock are our principal products coming out of Mexico, they go to the Florida and the Gulf Coast, and that's where concrete and base markets are growing significantly. So that's -- I think you hit the nail on the head, that is one of our really sweet spots as this recovery progresses.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. James for some closing remarks.","Donald M. James","Well, thank you so much for joining us today. We look forward to being able to talk with you for the next 3 quarters in 2013 and hopefully all of us can enjoy the benefits of the recovery in private sector construction. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Vulcan Materials earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

My name is Justin, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.","Mark Warren","Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow their prepared remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to call your attention to our quarterly supplemental materials posted at our website vulcanmaterials.com. You can access this presentation from the Investor Relations homepage of the website. A recording of this call will be available for replay at our website later today. Additionally, you can sign-up to receive future news releases under e-mail alerts found in the quick links on the Investor Relations homepage.","Please be reminded, the comments regarding the company\u2019s results and projections may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with our other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company\u2019s earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Additionally, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Hill","Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan. We had a solid start to the year, a 15% improvement in adjusted EBITDA and a 11% improvement in Aggregates\u2019 gross profit per ton. These results highlight the combined strength of our aggregates-focused business, our geographic footprint and our sharp focus on improving unit margins.","As you know, the principal drivers of our Aggregates\u2019 profitability are volume, price and operational efficiencies, so I\u2019ll address each of these in turn. First, Aggregates\u2019 shipments in the quarter increased by 13%, or 11% on a same-store basis. Importantly, the improvement was broad-based across our footprint. Of course, with record rainfall, California was the obvious exception, but with that said, reduced shipments in the West were more than offset by double-digit volume growth in our core markets in the East and Southeast and in Texas.","As we expected, some of the year-over-year improvement in these markets was due to pent-up demand from last year. This was evidenced by significantly higher shipments in January. Shipments in February, March were more in line with our full-year guidance. Overall, the pace of shipments in the first quarter clearly shows that demand is healthy.","The second profitability driver is price. And as predicted, our pricing continued to compound from the fourth quarter. On a freight-adjusted basis, pricing improved by 5.4% from last year. On a mix-adjusted basis, pricing increased by 5.8%. As with volume improvements, our pricing gains were widespread.","The third driver, and one that is sometimes overlooked, relates to operational efficiencies and cost control. Much of our time and attention is focused here, because it represents an area, where we can strongly influence the outcome. One of our key financial metrics is same-store flow-through. On a trailing 12-month basis, it was 57% at the end of March, in line with our 60% long-term guidance.","As we look forward to the rest of this year, our view of our markets remains on track with earlier expectations. We\u2019re still seeing growth in private demand in Vulcan-served markets. In the public sector, demand continues to grow and the increases in state and local highway funding, which we\u2019ve seen across our footprint are turning into shipments.","As we pointed out previously, we\u2019re in the very early stages of big growth in highway demand. 10 Vulcan states that generate approximately 80% of our revenue have passed infrastructure legislation over the last four years. These laws have raised funding by almost 50% over 2015 levels. The most recent state to join this stream was Alabama, which passed a gas tax in March.","The pace of conversion of public funding and lettings in the shipments continues to accelerate. We see this strengthen our backlog and booking pace, and this also supports a healthy pricing environment, which we experienced in the quarter and can also see going forward.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Suzanne for some additional color on the results. Suzanne?","Suzanne Wood","Thanks, Tom, and good morning. I\u2019ll cover a few additional items and then comment on our 2019 guidance. In first quarter, our same-store unit cost of sales increased year-over-year by 3%. The increase resulted in part from planned higher repair and maintenance costs.","We are keenly focused on reducing downtime in our plants in order to improve our operational efficiencies and throughput in the upcoming seasonally stronger quarters. In addition, California experienced higher than expected production costs due to record rainfall.","Our SAG costs were higher than last year as a result of the timing of certain expenses. For the full-year, we\u2019ll be in line with our previously provided guidance. On a trailing 12-month basis, these costs continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue and will remain focused on leveraging this part of our cost base.","With respect to the Asphalt segment, gross profit was lower than last year, but in line with our expectations. Shipments increased by 5% on a same-store basis and pricing also increased by 5%. Unfortunately, these gains weren\u2019t enough to offset the 29%, or $9 million increase in liquid asphalt costs. Concrete gross profit declined slightly compared to last year. Lower than anticipated shipments due to weather in Virginia were partially offset by modest price increases.","For the full-year, our outlook for the non-aggregates segment remains unchanged, as the first quarter is seldom indicative, particularly for asphalt.","I\u2019d like to move on now to the balance sheet and our cash flows. Our debt structure suits our business well. Our long-term debt reflects the weighted average debt maturity of 15 years and the weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. We intend to retain our investment-grade credit rating, and accordingly, the target range for our leverage ratio is 2 to 2.5 times. Currently, we are at 2.6 times, but expect to be within the range this year.","On Page 7 of the supplemental slides, you\u2019ll find information on our discretionary cash flow expectation for the full-year, using the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance as the starting point. As a reminder, we define discretionary cash flow as EBITDA less working capital change, interest, taxes and operating and maintenance capital. On this basis, our discretionary cash flow for 2019 is projected to approximate $735 million.","Using our capital allocation priorities, we can then determine the most returns-enhancing use of that cash, whether it\u2019s for internal growth projects, M&A, dividends, share repurchases or debt reduction. So as you consider your models, I\u2019ll share a couple of numbers with you.","In 2019, we expect to spend approximately $250 million on operating and maintenance capital, in line with our prior estimate. With respect to internal growth projects, our investment plan calls for $200 million, which is down about $50 million from 2018 spend and in line with earlier guidance.","Turning now to an update on 2019 earnings guidance. Simply put, our view remains consistent with our February outlook. The trends in our backlog project work, our booking pace and customer confidence continues to support our positive outlook for the remainder of this year.","As Tom said, our first quarter results were definitely a solid start, but we should keep in mind that it was first quarter, which is the smallest quarter of the year due to seasonality and thus, the least likely to affect our overall outcome for the full-year. The takeaway is that, we are generally where we expected to be at the end of March, having employed a thoughtful approach to our guidance earlier this year.","We therefore reaffirm our full-year expectations for 2019 adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, that guidance range is between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion. All other more detailed aspects of the guidance are shown on Page 8 in the supplemental slides.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.","Thomas Hill","Thanks, Suzanne. I\u2019m very proud of our people\u2019s performance in the first quarter. And I want to take this opportunity to thank our operators and our salespeople for taking care of our customers, holding each other to a high standard of operational excellence and delivering on financial results as promised.","A 25% improvement in Aggregates\u2019 gross profit and a 11% improvement in Aggregates\u2019 unit profitability, that\u2019s not easy in a winter quarter. I\u2019m also pleased that we continue to advance our safety culture in 2019 and improve on record-setting 2018 performance. So far this year, our injury rate was 0.85 accidents for 200,000 employee hours worked. Our number one job is to keep our people safe, and this is going to remain a central part of our operating disciplines.","As we move forward, we\u2019ll focus on the key elements that deliver value for our customers and our shareholders, and we will keep our people safe and allow our plants to operate at maximum efficiencies. We will execute at the local level and will drive unit margin expansion.","We have the best geographic footprint in the industry, and our business model and our people are flexible enough to take care \u2013 to take advantage of market opportunities and resilient enough to overcome market challenges. Our first quarter was a good step in the right direction towards achieving our 2019 goals.","Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi.","Thomas Hill","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Schrier","Hey, Tom, good morning and nice quarter.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Scott Schrier","So I want to start off with a bigger picture question. Obviously, due to the structure of the business, aggregates, particularly well-run aggregates businesses can come in higher multiples on peers. But with concerns about the cycle that really took hold towards the end of last year, one thing that supports a higher multiple is an elongated cycle, which comes from visibility and from the larger type projects, and I know you talked about it, Tom, in your prepared remarks.","Can you speak to the visibility we have right now and the growth trajectory? How long does this last? I mean, assuming, of course, the $2 trillion a quarter century plan discussed the other day, I think, the one you\u2019re aware. I know in the past you\u2019ve laid out things like mid-cycle EBITDAs. What\u2019s mid-cycle EBITDA? When does this happen? What \u2013 how much visibility do we have right now into the extension of the cycle?","Thomas Hill","All right. What we said was mid-cycle, we\u2019d about 255 million tons. And if you look at the cycle right now, let\u2019s take it in pieces. On the public side, we\u2019re stronger than we would have predicted five years ago. You\u2019ve got substantial funding from states. In fact, that funding in our states is up some 60% over 2015 level. So and \u2013 and not much of that is flowed through yet. So you\u2019ve got four, five years of big growth in highway demand.","Turning to the private side. On the residential, we see \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to see growth in the residential in our markets. Our customers feel good about single-family growth. Looking out, we see exciting markets with housing growth and a few that we\u2019re watching. What I\u2019d put on the watch list would be San Francisco, Nashville and Chicago. Exciting markets would be Houston, Southern California, Tampa, Jacksonville, all of Florida, a lot of the Southeast.","So the fundamentals of residential growth are still in place, population growth, employment growth in very low inventories of houses. So in our footprint, we still see growth in res. I would call out non-res very similar. Our backlogs, our booking pace are strong \u2013 we\u2019re shipping strong, our customers outlook is positive on non-res. So, we still see strength both on the private side and the public side.","Scott Schrier","Thanks. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask a couple of things on the cost front. Obviously, you\u2019ve got some fixed cost absorption in California. You had the repair and maintenance. Looks like we also had some inventory build. So if I\u2019m thinking about the cadence of the year, how can we think about some of those items? And I know that also in the past, sometimes you\u2019ve given us a cash gross profit per ton bridge. I\u2019m wondering if you could potentially walk us through that for the quarter?","Thomas Hill","Yes. So, it was \u2013 I would describe it as a typical cold, wet quarter. And our costs were up about 3%. About 1% of that was the impact of severe weather in California. I\u2019d also add to that, that our California team did an excellent job managing their cost in really tough headwinds.","The rest was \u2013 the majority of the rest was planned maintenance to get ready for the season, and that\u2019s very typical for our first \u2013 for a cold, wet quarter. You\u2019re just going to be inefficient in trying to crush rock when it\u2019s cold and wet. So you fix it while the weather is bad and run it when the weather is good. So we did a lot of R&M, planned R&M in preparation for the season.","We actually had a reduction in inventory, which was a little bit of a headwind for us. And again, that\u2019s not unusual in a cold, wet quarter. You shutdown the planned R&M, because you\u2019re not going to be efficient running. And I think our people have done a good job with inventories.","If you look back, we\u2019ve actually, over the last four, five years, we\u2019ve actually lowered inventories of long sizes, which will be based in fines, and that\u2019s really taken our inventory and that we\u2019re all returning it to cash. Our inventory turns have continued to move up over the last four, five years.","Suzanne Wood","Yes. And I would just add to that, Scott. I can see where you\u2019ve got the question about inventory being higher. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis on the balance sheet, it does appear to be higher, but that\u2019s as a result of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done year-over-year one \u2013 reasonably sized one in the paving and asphalt side of the business.","I think from the production cost standpoint in the quarter, the \u2013 probably the better way to look at it is to look at what your inventory actually did in the quarter. So if you look at the balance sheet, you can actually see a decline in finished product there.","Scott Schrier","Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it and good luck.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Thomas Hill","Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Yes, good morning. I wanted to start off kind of digging into the commentary you mentioned about the backlogs \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the deferred projects that benefited 1Q. February and March are more in line with your long \u2013 your year guidance for low to mid single-digit volume growth, whereas January was much stronger. I just wanted to dig into that a little bit.","January, I would anticipate would be much smaller volume-wise and February and particularly March. So it just implies some really strong volume growth in January. Am I understanding that correctly? So how strong was January? And then what does that speak to in terms of momentum carrying out of the quarter?","Thomas Hill","Yes. So, the shipments overall in the quarter is a robust first quarter. And that volume growth, which is very encouraging was very widespread with the obvious exception of California, which was just a washout. As we said, the big jump came in January. It was high double-digit.","And if you remember, when we made comments on the third quarter, we said we had a lot of pent-up demand and some of that may flow-through into 2019. That\u2019s actually what happened in January. It was as predicted, again, February and March were more in line with our guidance.","What we\u2019re seeing out there is a real sense of urgency from our customers to get work completed, so they can get on to their growing backlogs. And this was really evidenced in the first quarter as the weekend shipments were up 25% year-over-year. And what that signals is, those customers got to get the work done and they\u2019re willing to spend over time to get on to the next project.","The private continues to move up, as we said, where the big increase we\u2019re seeing in is in highway shipments and the flow-through of that funding. And I \u2013 as we said, that increase in funding flow-through will continue for the next four, five years. I think that as far as the rest of the year, as predicted, I would expect shipments to be more like February, March, but remember, it\u2019s still just the first quarter.","Nishu Sood","Got it, got it. I appreciate the details there. And then second question, one of the impressive thing about the numbers is the low double-digit aggregates volume growth, despite your largest market California being down double digits. You mentioned it was broad-based.","How much did the Aggregates USA footprint, which would have been less weather affected, perhaps impact that? So just how were you \u2013 if you could dig into how you\u2019re able to offset the double-digit declines in your largest market with the rest of your footprint? What were the particular drivers of strength or regions?","Thomas Hill","Well, I think that everywhere except for California saw strength, particularly in our very important Southeast market. We\u2019re the largest producer in the Southeast, and we really, really benefited from big demand in those Southeastern states. It was just widespread. And again, you had some big projects scattered out across that flowed from fourth quarter last year into first quarter this year and that was really what you saw in January.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas Hill","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Thomas Hill","Good morning, Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking\u2026","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Kathryn Thompson","\u2026thank you for taking my questions today. Just \u2013 so first on the follow-up on CapEx. Could you give us a little bit more color on the $55 million spend for internal growth projects and expected returns? So there\u2019s looking \u2013 building out new sites. But just wanted to get some more color on what type of growth projects you\u2019re targeting for this?","Suzanne Wood","Sure. I\u2019ll address that one, Kathryn. In terms of the growth projects and what we spent on in the quarter, they are largely \u2013 the spend was largely on what we\u2019ve outlined before we are opening some additional sales and distribution networks in certain parts of the country, along the Gulf Coast into Charleston as well to sort of help expand the network there.","We are also expending money on the opening of two or three greenfield sites, one of which is in California. And we would expect and that one to hopefully begin having a few shipments from that late this year.","In terms of returns, we don\u2019t go into the specifics of the returns on those individual projects other than to say that they are definitely accretive to the returns of the company and have a higher return than what we \u2013 what the company generates overall. And that\u2019s the main reason for doing those projects.","As you look at an internal growth project versus M&A, this is a way to get exactly what you want, where you want it without potentially having to pay a lot of blue sky. And when you are able to do it internally, it causes the return on investment to rise.","Thomas Hill","I would add to that. There\u2019s a ramp-up time for these just because when you buy something it\u2019s already going to this when you have to ramp-up. But they\u2019re adjacent or in our footprint, so they\u2019re additive to the franchise and protect the franchise and there are some of our highest returns that \u2013 you\u2019re not painting the blue sky, but you also the flip side as it takes a little time to ramp-up.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, perfect. And then a follow-up on ASPs. Nice job in the quarter. Thank you also for confirming that. You didn\u2019t build inventory and it does look that from an industry standpoint, at least, from the folks we\u2019ve \u2013 with whom we\u2019ve spoken. In general there has not been an inventory build in Q1 this year to the same degree as last year. Just a confirmation that this certainly should be positive for pricing going forward?","And then second, on a follow-up to that, could you just give more quantification or color on the commentary of project type mix in the quarter and how this impacted pricing for the quarter? And really more importantly, how you think it will \u2013 how it impacts it as we look further out 12 to 18 months from now? Thank you very much.","Thomas Hill","Yes, thank you. The quarter \u2013 the pricing momentum in our markets continues to improve. This was, as we predicted, third quarter, fourth quarter last year. The mix was about 40 basis points. All of that was base, which a higher base refines in a cold wet weather is not unusual. It\u2019s also indicative of new highway construction.","But overall, we\u2019re seeing widespread pricing momentum across our vast majority of our markets. In fact, all the one market \u2013 every market we reinstall price increases, they\u2019re for one and that one was flat. The \u2013 I think the foundation of this is the visibility to that highway growth and the continued demand growth and shipping growth on the private side.","Our January and April price increases to fixed plants were all in place. And we\u2019ll see bid work push up throughout the year. And as you know, bid work is a campaign over time, it\u2019s not a one-time price increase.","So the 2019 price increases came out of the gate strong. But I think what\u2019s really important here is, it provides a good start to our improve unit margins. As we said, those unit margins were up a 11% in the quarter. And this is the second quarter in a row that we\u2019ve grown unit margins in the face of some pretty tough conditions. And that\u2019s simply sound execution and disciplines under difficult circumstances by our people.","And if you remember, if you kind of look back over time, this is usual for us. If you look back six years, we\u2019ve gone from $3 \u2013 roughly $3 to just under $3 to almost $5 from the trailing 12-month basis on unit margins, that\u2019s 12% compounded annual growth rate and we saw 11% in the first quarter. So my hats off to our sales and ops folks and we thank them for that. And this is our job and we\u2019ll keep looking at it.","Suzanne Wood","Yes. I just add one thing there, Kathryn, going back to the commentary around base sales and the fact that our \u2013 that produced a bit of unfavorable product mix of about 40 basis points. Our base sales did increase pretty substantially in the first quarter year-over-year. Last year, they constituted about 22%, this year, about 27%. So that\u2019s about 500 bps up. So to \u2013 given that significant increase to only have a product mix effect of about 40 basis points, I think is pretty good.","Kathryn Thompson","Yes, perfect. Thank you so much.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Benjamin Burud","Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry.","Thomas Hill","Good morning, Ben.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, Ben.","Benjamin Burud","Good morning. Just wanted to touch on pricing. So if we look back to last year, pricing improved over the course of 2018. So as a result, you\u2019ll probably be facing tougher comps in the second-half. As a result, obviously you had very strong pricing 5.8% year-over-year, excluding mix. Should we think about pricing kind of steady over the course of the year, or does that comp \u2013 the second-half comp present a meaningful headwind?","Thomas Hill","I think you nailed it. I think, we would expect our price increases to be steady throughout the year in line with our guidance. And you have to remember, so we \u2013 the fixed plants, as I said, went into effect in January and April. You\u2019ll see some \u2013 some of those you\u2019ll see mid-year price increases. But the bid work, which is the majority of our work, as I said, is a campaign over time, and we\u2019ll continue to push that up throughout the year.","And you got to remember, we were looking at our backlogs and our booking pace and our pricing, our book pace, and it will support that 5% to 7% guidance that we\u2019ve given, and I would see that smoother in 2019, whereas it was kind of a ramp-up in 2018.","Benjamin Burud","Got it. And this kind of feeds into the mid-cycle question you addressed earlier, but I appreciate that it\u2019s a few quarters away. But can you kind of give us an idea how you\u2019re thinking about pricing in 2020? It\u2019s obviously very strong this year. Can we keep that momentum into 2020 and continue that path to a strong mid-cycle level of performance?","Thomas Hill","I think I would turn that to \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re not going to give you guidance for 2020, it\u2019s too early. We\u2019re still in first stages of 2019. But I think what I would look at there is what drives price and its visibility and work that\u2019s coming, so people secure that they can take price in and give prices out there in the marketplace. And that is what so important about the growing highway demand. It is \u2013 everybody knows it\u2019s there. It\u2019s very visible. They know way out in advance what\u2019s coming.","And so whereas private work in is helpful there, but it\u2019s a little less visibility and a little less sure than a state saying they\u2019re going to do XYZ jobs. So I would predict pricing to continue \u2013 the momentum to continue to increase over time underpins again by the visibility to highway demand.","Benjamin Burud","Got it. And if I could just squeeze in one quick follow-up on that note. Obviously, the infrastructure demand is very, very positive. There\u2019s nothing that you guys see looking out that would represent a downside risk to the current infrastructure demand, kind of like what we saw in 2017 where there were project delays or engineering constraints. Is that not the case this time around?","Thomas Hill","There\u2019s enough flowing through, I would expect it to be a little smoother. You got to remember, we were back to 2017, that was just a couple of states that had new highway bills. Now we\u2019ve got 10 of our states that have all passed increased funding, that funding increases $20 billion a year versus over 10 states, where the federal bill is $45 billion a year over 50 states.","So this is substantial. It\u2019s big. It\u2019s widespread. And I think will there be air pockets of how fast it grows by or it will be, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be a smooth go up. I would expect it to always be going up over the next four or five years, though.","Benjamin Burud","Awesome. I appreciate the color.","Thomas Hill","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Next will be Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Hey, guys, great quarter.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, Phil.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Phil Ng","It seemed like some of the bottlenecks that may have held you back, had started to ease a bit. Curious, your ability to kind of play catch-up, given some of this pent-up demand. And if you continue to see double-digit growth like you did in the quarter, we\u2019re not saying that\u2019s the case for the rest of the year. But if you had that type of growth trajectory, do you have enough bandwidth in inventory to kind of meet that demand?","Thomas Hill","Oh, sure. I mean, we had the bandwidth in production capacity. I mean, the capacity is built in these plants to do 300 million tons, it\u2019s just a matter of hours. But we\u2019ll handle whatever comes at us, and we have the power to do that. I\u2019m not at all worried about that, in fact, I\u2019ve loved to have that problem.","Phil Ng","Okay, sounds great. And then shifting gears to like California, what are you expecting in terms of how much that market grows this year? There\u2019s certainly some puts and takes. We have already showing some signs of a slowdown and the softer 1Q start, the public sounds quite robust with SB1. And can you remind us what are the splits between private and public for California?","Thomas Hill","Yes. The \u2013 obviously, the first quarter in California was a washout, but the fundamentals in California are very strong. You\u2019ve got SB1 coming on with a steadily increasing implementation. Remember, we\u2019re only a year-and-a-half into the funding of SB1. We always tell you, it takes two years. But Caltrans is actually doing a pretty good job in getting work out there. We\u2019ve already backlogged probably 1.5 million tons of aggregates and a 1 million tons of asphalt. And you got to remember, much of that is going to ship this year.","Remember, we\u2019re the largest aggregate and asphalt producer in California. So this is right in our wheelhouse. The backlogs and booking pace would support our plan for the year. We will have a good performance in California this year. Time will tell, if we can catch-up on projected volumes in California for 2019 with the works there.","Management team actually performed extremely well in a tough quarter with our cost I said earlier. It boils down to, I\u2019m not concerned about California, if anything actually very excited about California, both the demand level on the private side and big demand coming on the public side, our team\u2019s performance. So we\u2019ll have a good year in California.","As far as the split, I would tell you, in Southern California, we are more about 50-50, like we are across the country with \u2013 of private versus public. In Northern California, we are \u2013 in Central Northern California, we\u2019re probably heavier on the public side than we are on the private side.","Phil Ng","Got it. And just one last one for me. Can you talk about how trends are tracking in April and May? And how extended are your backlogs? I know, one of your competitors mentioned some of their customers and contractors have started to reach out for work in 2020, right? Just curious if you\u2019re seeing some of that as well? Thanks a lot.","Thomas Hill","I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t hear the first of your question.","Phil Ng","Can you talk about how your trends are tracking in April and May \u2013 early May?","Thomas Hill","Yes. Well Ms. Wood just kick me under the table about what I\u2019ll be trying to talk about April and May. But I would call out the full-year. I would expect our price and volume to track pretty smoothly as what we have in our guidance.","Phil Ng","Got it. And then the backlogs, are you having conversations with customers into 2020 already, or how\u2019s that kind of shaking out?","Thomas Hill","Well, some of the big work that we\u2019re bidding today will flow into 2020. But most of it\u2019s going to be shipped in 2019. But we \u2013 when we bid work that goes out years to come, we\u2019ll put escalators in it.","Phil Ng","Got it. All right, thanks a lot.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.","Thomas Hill","Good morning, Adam.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Adam Thalhimer","Good morning. Great quarter.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Adam Thalhimer","Tom, sorry to harp on this again, but I\u2019m just curious on the guidance \u2013 the volume guidance with such a strong start to the year. 5% volume guidance would be kind of, I don\u2019t know 3% each quarter for the rest of the year. Is there any some conservatism baked in on your part there?","Thomas Hill","Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019d rather have the first \u2013 I\u2019d be rather be ahead on this on the batting than behind. But you got to remember, it\u2019s still the first quarter. And if history repeats itself, we\u2019re going to see some headwinds this year. And you saw February and March ship more like guidance, so it\u2019s a solid start. I think we were thoughtful in our guidance and I still think we\u2019re thoughtful in our guidance.","I don\u2019t \u2013 again, it\u2019s a great start. But it\u2019s \u2013 we \u2013 most years, we see some storms and fires and hurricanes in there, and who knows what\u2019s going to happen this year, hopefully not, but we\u2019ll see.","Suzanne Wood","Yes. I would just add to that. I mean, I think it\u2019s a little bit early, yes, it was a great start to the year. As Tom said, we did have some pent-up demand coming through in January that propelled the numbers beyond the guidance. We feel comfortable with where we are from a backlogs and booking pace perspective for the rest of the year.","But I think only 45 days or so, 60 days or so after we gave the initial guidance that we spent a lot of time thinking about taking all of these factors into effect, it\u2019s probably a bit premature to to go down the path of revising that at this point on the basis of the seasonally slowest quarter of the year.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay, understood. And then can you give a little more color on non-res, Tom, particularly the bidding?","Thomas Hill","Sure. As we look out, our non-res shipments have been strong. Our customers\u2019 outlook is very positive in non-res. The backlogs and booking pace or good. In non-res, you rarely see all of your markets line up at the same time as strong.","So I\u2019d call out markets that we watch out \u2013 we\u2019re watching from a non-res and some excited about the watch list would be \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to go down. They are just \u2013 we\u2019re not quite as excited about them as we are others the watch list would be places like Baltimore, Nashville, Dallas markets where we feel very good about our non-res side about, would include Southern California, Atlanta, Phoenix and North Virginia. But I think we\u2019ll continue to see strength in shipments in non-res throughout 2019.","Adam Thalhimer","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Thomas Hill","Good morning.","Mike Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to \u2013 first question circle back on one of the earlier questions and comments around cost quantification just on the 3% unit cost. It sounded like 1% was kind of weather impact. So then, if we look at the bulk of the remaining, I think, that would translate to roughly 10-ish million in terms of headwinds from some of the maintenance and repair costs. So first, is that on track? And then second, how should we be thinking about unit cost through the balance of the year as you get back into seasonally stronger periods?","Thomas Hill","So that\u2019s a good question. On the call California \u2013 so cost went up 3%, I will look at this way. California was about a percent of that. And even \u2013 now with that said, I think, our folks did a good job, they just had a tough go of it and that happened we had that much rain.","The other 2% \u2013 about 1.5% that would be R&M. I said R&M, repair and maintenance and this is we took plants down, because it was not a good time to run. And that\u2019s what we should have been doing and then when the sun comes out, the season will \u2013 we can run at maximum efficiencies. And then inventories was about a 0.5%, and again that was by design and that you don\u2019t need to be trying to build inventories when you have operating efficiency. So that\u2019s how I look at it.","As I look through the quarter, I would expect \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t see big shifts in inventories. I wouldn\u2019t expect California to \u2013 the sunshine back sign in the California back running. I think that operating team is very talented and they will do a very good job with that. And our R&M will level as the year goes along and we start running.","Mike Dahl","Okay. So flattish in terms of unit costs for the balance of the year, and that\u2019s kind of how you get back to the 60% incrementals, is that fair?","Thomas Hill","That\u2019s probably a little better, up a little bit than flat, but in all said, yes, you\u2019re correct.","Suzanne Wood","Generally flat, yes.","Mike Dahl","Okay. And then my last question, just on the mix commentary, understand the impact of the base from a product standpoint. So if you think about the potential for a rebound in California and the mix of base potentially move a bit lower through the year. How should we be thinking about the overall mix impact within your full-year guide as it relates to the pricing?","Thomas Hill","I would expect not a big impact from mix geographically, if anything maybe a little positive of the mix on product mix, I would expect base to continue to be pretty strong, maybe not as strong as it was in Q1. But the reason I say that is, you\u2019ve got a lot of new construction out there with this \u2013 with the highway funding. So and then, by the way, this is a good thing. This is not \u2013 but we\u2019d go back to \u2013 and I\u2019d point you right back to guidance, which is 5 to 7 mix adjusted.","Mike Dahl","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next will be Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Thomas Hill","Good morning, Trey.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Trey Grooms","Hey, good morning, Tom and Suzanne. So I guess, first off, the \u2013 you mentioned you\u2019re seeing kind of an accelerated or accelerating transition from lettings to actually seeing aggregate shipments. Tom, what in your opinion, what\u2019s driving this? And is it sustainable as we kind of start moving into the busier time here as we look at the backlog that you have, as we look at the states that you\u2019re in and the increase in funding? Is this, I guess, shorter lag between a lettings? And when you guys see work, is that sustainable, or do you see that kind of stretching out again?","Thomas Hill","I think, what I see is, this is sustainable. In fact, I think it is going to compound that growth rate over time, as funding within a state matures and then as funding between each state comes online. So I would expect it to be stronger over time. You\u2019re seeing it in our backlogs, you\u2019re seeing it in the highway lettings, you\u2019re seeing it in the highway \u2013 in the state\u2019s highways budgets. It is \u2013 the bottom line of it is, it is the maturing of the DOTs into their funding. And as we said, it takes two years and then it ramps up over time.","Suzanne Wood","Yes. I think Tom is exactly right on that. I mean this is just a natural progression. It takes about two years. And so you\u2019re beginning to see come through now some of which we had hoped would have come through last year, but it just takes longer when the projects are initially beginning to ramp up.","Trey Grooms","Got it. All right. And then you mentioned January benefiting from some pent-up demand. Is \u2013 was that more kind of the catch-up you\u2019re talking about here, or it was that just weather-related things that didn\u2019t happen last year that kind of pushed into January that was a catch-up period and now we\u2019re back to normal?","Thomas Hill","I think, well, the overall growth is what we\u2019re talking about. The bubble, so to speak, in January was work that flowed through from 2018.","Trey Grooms","Okay. And so California weather likely created some level of pent-up demand. How should we think about that flow-through? And then also you mentioned Virginia weather impacting ready-mix. Did that impact aggregate shipments as well? And is there any pent-up, I guess, shipments there?","Thomas Hill","I\u2019ll tell you Virginia first. The cold wet weather is going to impact ready-mix concrete worse than it is rocks, so we shipped \u2013 we actually shipped a lot of base. Aggregate shipments in Virginia were actually up in spite of the weather. And \u2013 but it was more based in clean stone and that again is very typical for a cold wet quarter.","We also did more vertical work last year in ready-mix than we have more flat work this year. It is also \u2013 the flat work is more weather-sensitive. So not worried about Virginia, but Virginia will have a very good year and had a great start with aggregates, but the ready-mix backlogs are there and it will perform.","On California, I think it\u2019s this. Again, the booking pace and backlogs in California, both from a volume and a price perspective is excellent. Same thing with our asphalt, with going prices in asphalt will have a very good year in California. The timing of this was such a quarter, I can\u2019t predict yet. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get it all done.","Our customers want that to happen with sunshine in there. They\u2019re shipping and they\u2019re busy. But it\u2019s really a matter of do you have enough days and the timing of those projects. But again, that\u2019s a matter of timing. California\u2019s going to have a good years, it\u2019s a matter of whether it\u2019s a good year or great year, but it will be solid. And if we don\u2019t do it in 2019, we\u2019ll do in 2020.","Trey Grooms","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to you and the team on a good quarter.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Thomas Hill","Good morning, Garik.","Jeffrey Stevenson","Hey, this is Jeff Stevenson on Garik.","Thomas Hill","Oh, hi, Jeff.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Stevenson","Hey, how are you?","Thomas Hill","Good.","Jeffrey Stevenson","My first question was just a follow-up on California. I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on contractor labor and other capacity issues that might impact demand from getting work through this year?","Thomas Hill","Yes. Well, labor is an issue, not just in California, everywhere, and not so much for us. But we have pressures on labor, but we can get it done. It\u2019s really our customers. I think that highway demand growing faster is more labor-efficient, so that will actually help us. But everybody has pressures on labor, but it really affects.","And I think \u2013 backing up to the highway, our contracted customers of the highway piece of this have done a good job, building labor forces with the visibility to the work coming. But it will be a constrained and that\u2019s just a piece of the question mark of can we get all work done in 2019, again, it\u2019s a timing issue. But \u2013 so labor is an issue, but we\u2019ll shift past, I think.","Jeffrey Stevenson","Okay, great. And then you\u2019d expect that asphalt to make up most of the gross profit improvement in the downstream business. And just wondering if this is tracking in line with your expectations, given liquid asphalt cost of product more than expected.","Thomas Hill","Yes. The quarter was actually right in line with our expectations. Prices and hot mix were up 5%, but liquid costs were up $100 a ton for liquid. So liquid cost us in the quarter about $9 million. Now that\u2019s first quarter. If you look back to the fourth quarter, liquid is, as predicted, is pretty much level out and our backlog and our booking pricing on future work for hot mix, it continues to escalate.","So we\u2019ll catch this up. It\u2019ll be a ramp up throughout the year. But I think we\u2019re good with our plan, accomplishing our plan. And the big ramp-up in highway demand is very, very important for that asphalt product line, because that\u2019s what most of the painting is.","Suzanne Wood","And I would just add to that. In terms of asphalt, when you think about the guidance that we gave for the year back in February, we said that a majority of the improvement in gross profit would come from increased volume. And based on our backlogs and booking paces, as Tom said, we feel pretty comfortable with that right now.","And the other point I would make is that, particularly with respect to the first quarter, remember, in California, that is an extremely big asphalt business for us And so, no doubt. While we were pretty much on track with what we expected in first quarter from an asphalt perspective, California, if it hadn\u2019t been raining out there virtually every single day, that would have certainly been helpful as well. So we can look forward to that as the sun begins to shine a bit more.","Jeffrey Stevenson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Thomas Hill","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next will be Adrian with JPMorgan.","Thomas Hill","Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Hi, good morning, Adrian.","Adrian Huerta","Hi, good morning, Tom and Suzanne. Thank you for taking my question. Just two questions. One is, what percentage of your territories you had the price increases in January and what percentage was in April?","And the second question is, you did not have much M&A activity in the quarter. Should we expect lower M&A activity this year, probably on higher valuations than what we had last year? Thanks.","Thomas Hill","As far as pricing is concerned, it was pretty consistent through the quarter as how the poor turned out and that was as we predicted in the fourth quarter \u2013 for the fourth quarter call. So it was \u2013 and I would expect that throughout the year.","As far as M&A, we\u2019re always working on a few of these that\u2019s happening today. It\u2019s always hard \u2013 it\u2019s to predict what\u2019s going to happen M&A as the seller side, when they want to sell and we don\u2019t have a lot of control over that. I think, what I was \u2013 what I look forward for us in M&A is, I\u2019ve said there\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s discipline \u2013 be disciplined about what you\u2019re going to buy and be disciplined about those synergies that are unique to us, try not to pay for those, make sure you don\u2019t overpay pressure test the project. And then once you get it, make sure you integrate it quickly and accurately.","Adrian Huerta","Okay.","Suzanne Wood","That\u2019s right. And I would also add to that from the M&A perspective. If you look back to the amount of spend we\u2019ve had in M&A over the past 12 to 18 months, it has been pretty sizable for us. And so I think whether there is a deal out there to be done or not, I think, having a relatively quiet quarter to make sure, as Tom said, those are embedded in and we stay very focused on making sure we get off to a really good start in the aggregates business is probably the most important thing for us to have done in the first quarter.","Adrian Huerta","Understood, Tom and Suzanne. And you mentioned at the opening three, I think, you said three quarries and one in California. And what are the chances that we could see even more quarries being opened this year?","Thomas Hill","I think that quarry took about 10 or 15 years in development. It is \u2013 and it took a lot of work for our local folks. It is extremely hard to open a quarry anywhere much less California.","Adrian Huerta","And how big is going to be this quarry in California?","Thomas Hill","It\u2019s a mid-range quarry, but I don\u2019t think we want to be public about that at this point.","Adrian Huerta","Thank you, Tom.","Thomas Hill","Thank you.","Operator","Next will be Lee Nalley with SunTrust.","Lee Nalley","Hi, thanks for taking my question.","Thomas Hill","Good morning.","Suzanne Wood","Good morning.","Thomas Hill","Sure.","Lee Nalley","Good morning, good morning. So just a real quick. In the past you guys have discussed leverage target 2 to 2.5 times, I think, you confirmed that last quarter. But prior to that, there are also \u2013 there\u2019s also this target of 1.5 times at the cycle peak. I\u2019m just wondering can you give your kind of updated thoughts on how you manage \u2013 plan to manage leverage through the cycle? And is that 1.5 times target still out there?","Suzanne Wood","Yes. Our target range is 2 to 2.5 times through the cycle, and we are comfortable with that. We think that\u2019s an appropriate leverage range. It gives us the the flexibility and stability we need to manage through the cycle, because remember, in the downturn, we will be \u2013 even though EBITDA may fall a bit from fewer shipments, we\u2019ll be very cash-generative, because we\u2019ll basically be spending virtually nothing on growth CapEx. And if we go into the cycle as we plan to with our fleet pretty young, then we will not have to spend very much at all on \u2013 from an operating and maintenance side as well.","So that cash profile that\u2019s a little countercyclical to profit gives you some cushion as well. We like to be flexible in what we do. We\u2019re comfortable with the 2 to 2.5 times. But certainly, if we were in the middle of the cycle and felt it was appropriate to reduce the leverage range further, that is certainly within our remit to do. But when you think about our business model, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the 2 to 2.5 times. We\u2019d certainly like to be toward the lower-end or at the lower-end of that range, as you\u2019re entering the downturn.","Lee Nalley","Thanks. All that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the clarification.","Suzanne Wood","Sure.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hill for any additional or closing remarks.","Thomas Hill","Again, thank you for your time today and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter. Have a good day.","Suzanne Wood","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day."],"21880":["Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Donald M.

My name is Ian and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir.","Donald M. James","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2012. I'm Don James, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Materials Company. Joining me today on the call are Dan Sansone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Danny Shepherd, our Executive Vice President for Construction Materials.","We have posted a short slide presentation to our website that we will reference during this call. These slides are also available to those of you on the webcast.","Looking at Slide 2 and before we begin, let me remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties","Descriptions of these risk and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS for continuing operations. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's second quarter 2012 earnings release and in the Investor Relations section of Vulcan's website.","Turning now to Slide 3. Before we walk through the quarterly result, I wanted to briefly discuss a few highlights from the quarter. We remain keenly focused on reducing overhead cost and maximizing operation efficiency across the organization. These efforts have enabled us to continue to increase profitability, while sales remained essentially flat. Adjusted EBITDA was $127 million in the second quarter of this year, an increase of $10 million or 8% over last year's second quarter.","We achieved higher EBITDA despite a slight decline in net sales. This decline is due in part to demand weakness in certain of our markets to the pull-forward effect of seasonably favorable weather conditions during the first quarter and unusually severe weather from tropical storm Debby in Florida in June. These negative influences were offset by encouraging growth in a number of our other key markets.","Despite weaker volumes in several of our most profitable markets, Aggregates segment gross profit margin increased 220 basis points, and cash earnings per ton of aggregates improved to $4.57. Both of these improvements demonstrate our cost-reduction efforts, and earnings potential of our Aggregates business, particularly as volumes across our geographic markets recover.","SAG expenses were reduced during the quarter by approximately 16%, reflecting our organizational restructuring and our cost reduction initiatives.","As we look ahead, activity in both private and public sector construction markets continues to improve.","We are encouraged by the passage of a new multi-year highway bill, signed into law in early July, which should provide State Department of Transportation with a funding certainty that they need to move forward on infrastructure programs.","I will discuss some of the details regarding the highway bill a bit later in the call.","We've also made important progress on our initiatives to enable Vulcan to continue to generate higher levels of earnings in cash flow, further improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead cost and strengthen our credit profile.","Turning now to Slide 4. As I noted, net sales for the quarter were approximately $649 million, which is a 1% decrease from the second quarter of 2011. For the first 6 months of 2012, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion, 3% higher than the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $127 million in the second quarter of 2012, which is an increase of $10 million or 8% over the second quarter in the prior year.","When making year-over-year comparisons of earnings and EBITDA, I want to highlight 3 items that are better excluded from the adjusted EBITDA. The second quarter results include $32 million of cost related to the unsolicited exchange offer by Martin Marietta. They also include $4.5 million of charges associated with the implementation of our Profit Enhancement Plan. And finally, we recorded a $12 million gain on the sale of mitigation credits in California during the quarter.","For the first half of 2012, EBITDA increased $52 million or 42% from the first half of 2011. I also want to point out, again, our continued success in reducing overhead cost. SAG expenses were 16% lower in both the second quarter and the first half. These decreases are the direct result of restructuring initiatives we undertook during 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, as well as the early benefits of the Profit Enhancement Plan we announced in February. We will provide an update on the Profit Enhancement Plan shortly.","I'll now turn the call over to Danny Shepherd, who will walk you through our segment results for the quarter and an update on our Profit Enhancement Plan and Planned Asset Sales.","Danny R. Shepherd","Thank you, Don.","Turning to segment results on Slide 5. Aggregates segment results revenues were pressured by sluggish demand in certain markets and relatively weaker volumes in several of our most profitable markets. Aggregates volumes declined by double-digit percentages in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. All of these states are relatively high margin states for Vulcan, so the volume decreases in those states had a larger impact on bottom-line result.","On the positive side, we achieved double-digit growth in shipments in a number of key states, including Alabama, Florida, Illinois, and Texas, while shipments in Virginia and California continued to show improvement compared to the prior year.","These year-over-year increases in Aggregates shipments were due mainly to large infrastructure project work, primarily highways, and increased private construction activity in these states. I should also note that while volume growth was strong in Florida, as Don mentioned, the severe wet weather in June from tropical storm Debby impeded the level of shipments in Florida in June, reducing the quarterly gains.","The average freight adjusted selling price increased slightly in the quarter due primarily to some price improvement in private construction work and offset mostly by the negative impact of geographic and product mix.","Overall, we believe our pricing in our markets remained solid with additional improvement expected in the second half of the year.","While the top line was sluggish, we continued to drive stronger profitability. On a $7 million decline in revenues, our Aggregates gross profit increased by approximately $9 million, reflecting lower unit cost of sales.","As a percentage of segment revenues, Aggregates gross profit increased by 220 basis points for the quarter. Cash earnings per ton of Aggregates increased to $4.57 per ton. All key labor productivity and energy efficiency metrics improved from last year. The unit cost for diesel fuel decreased 4%, accounting for $1 million of the increase in gross profit.","Moving to Asphalt. For our Asphalt Mix segment, gross profit in the second quarter was $5 million compared with $8 million in the year-ago period. The unit cost for liquid Asphalt increased 7%, which contributed to the decline in segment earnings.","The average sales price for Asphalt Mix increased slightly from the prior year, offsetting some of the earnings effect of an 8% decline in volumes.","Concrete gross profit was a loss of $9 million, which is in line with the prior-year period. Ready-mixed concrete volumes increased 6% from the prior year. The earnings effect of higher volumes was offset by the unfavorable geographic mix.","Finally, Cement. Cement segment gross profit with a loss of $2 million compared to a loss of $1 million in the prior year. A planned maintenance outage at the company's cement plant in Florida, as well as cost related to production disruption from heavy rain and power outages from tropical storm Debby negatively affected segment earnings in the second quarter.","In total, gross profit for our non-aggregates segment decreased by $4 million.","Turning to Slide 6. Now, I'd like to highlight the steady progress we are making as a part of the Profit Enhancement Plan announced in February. As you may recall from the call, the Profit Enhancement Plan includes cost reductions and other profit enhancement initiatives intended to improve our run rate profitability as measured by EBITDA, and we would expect to improve $100 million annually at current volumes.","The Profit Enhancement Plan is focused on 3 major areas: We have a $55 million target in sourcing. We have $25 million target in G&A and another $20 million target for transportation and logistics.","As previously announced, we expect to achieve at least $25 million of the Profit Enhancement Plan in 2012 and the remainder in 2013.","Employees throughout the organization are implementing actions to improve our profitability across all business segments. And thanks to their continuing efforts, we remain very confident that we will achieve our Profit Enhancement goal.","Through the first half of 2012, we've reduced total company controllable cost by $55 million from the prior year. This includes the benefit of previously announced restructuring, as well as the initial results of our Profit Enhancement Plan. The latest portion of restructuring and implementation cost for the Profit Enhancement Plan, approximately $4.5 million, was incurred in the second quarter. The company expects to incur an additional $3 million in restructuring and implementation cost as work is completed in the second half of 2012.","There are over 200 specific Profit Enhancement initiatives underway across Vulcan's regions and functions. Our entire team, in particular, the managers and staff closest to our operations and customers, has risen to the challenges presented by today's difficult market conditions. The actions being taken will positively impact our already impressive cash margins per ton, further improving our leverage as demand recovers.","To give some examples, in the area of G&A, we worked on further consolidating back office transactional activities into shared services and rightsizing shared services staffing. Types of actions we've taken in sourcing include renegotiating several large supply contracts at reduced rates, implementing enhanced bidding requirements for certain third-party services and implementing a new TNE [ph] cost policy.","A specific example of an action we've taken in transportation is optimizing fuel efficiency of Vulcan's ships. We remain very committed to our Profit Enhancement Plan, and execution of these initiatives will remain a top priority for corporate and region management.","Now for a brief update on Planned Asset Sales. It won't take a minute to give this update. As you may recall, we are planning to sell non-core assets in a disciplined and strategic manner. These are good assets, many of which we -- which will have a significant value to a number of potential purchasers. Our objective is to generate net after-tax proceeds of approximately $500 million by mid-2013, helping to strengthen our balance sheet, unlock capital for more productive uses and create value for our shareholders.","We've been pleased with the level of interest in activity surrounding this process thus far. During the last several months, we have maintained active discussions and engaged in negotiations with multiple potential purchasers. These discussions include potential sales and other transactions involving a portfolio of assets that are not central to the company's strategy. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months, and I'll now turn the call back over to Don.","Donald M. James","Thanks, Danny. We're becoming more confident as we move to Slide 7, that the worst of this economic downturn in construction is behind us. This view is supported by increased contract awards for new construction projects, particularly in private construction, which bodes well for continued demand recovery in our markets.","Multi-family housing starts have been growing now for 20 consecutive months. The trailing 12-month single-family housing starts turned positive in the first quarter of 2012 on the back of higher starts reported in recent months.","The trailing 12-month contract awards for private nonresidential construction have been growing for the last 16 months. This trend is driven by growth in the boards for commercial and retail buildings. Additionally, trailing 12-month awards for Vulcan-served states and this private non-res category are up 7% versus 2% for other states. This is another positive indicator for continued demand recovery in our high-growth markets.","Turning now to Slide 8. We continue to be optimistic about the trends in the private and public sector construction. We are encouraged about the passage of the new multi-year highway bill by Congress in late June. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in both the House and the Senate, and it was signed into law by the President on July 6. This bill, called MAP-21, is designed to provide State Departments of Transportation with funding certainty in order to allow them to move forward on infrastructure programs. It will help rebuild America's aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system, while also protecting millions of jobs.","The bill maintains essentially level funding for the next 2 fiscal years with over $105 billion for total funding through fiscal year 2014. It extends the Highway Trust Fund and tax collections through fiscal year 2016, which is 2 years beyond the reauthorization period and adds additional stability that we have not had for the last several years.","The bill's substantial highway provisions are more reform-focused than previous bills, with a strong emphasis on improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects. Funding directly for highways provides a floor of $82 billion for fiscal years '13 and '14. On top of this, there's a very significant increase in the TIFIA program, which stands for Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. Funding for this program will increase to $1.75 billion over the next 2-year period from only $122 million per year under SAFETEA-LU. According to the Federal Highway Administration, TIFIA funding is typically leveraged by a factor of 10, so that there is a potential for a $17.5 billion in additional major project funding for fiscal years '13 and '14 over and above the $82 billion in the regular highway program. TIFIA is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investments for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the United States, including large portions of our footprint. The program provides credit assistance in the form of secured loans, loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects.","Eligible sponsors for TIFIA projects include states and local governments, private firms, special authorities and transportation improvement districts. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, large multimodal projects, as well as freight transfer and transit facilities. Some of the existing TIFIA projects that those of you around the country may be familiar with would include the Capital Beltway HOT lanes in Virginia, the I-595 corridor improvements in Florida, and the Presidio Parkway in California, as well as the Central Texas Turnpike in Texas.","Overall, MAP-21 creates a positive framework for future authorization through its significant reforms, consolidating and simplifying Federal Highway Programs, accelerating the project delivery process, expanding project financing and promoting public-private partnership opportunities. And needless to say, the fact that Congress was able to pass the bill in the current political climate, maintaining funding levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what all the pundits expected, has its own significance, and makes us even more optimistic about the bill to have Congress to continue to work towards long-term solutions to rebuild America's infrastructure.","Vulcan played a very active role in support of this legislation, communicating with Congress about the critical need for infrastructure investment. We have worked on this critical issue and will continue to do so, both as Vulcan and as part of broad coalition of key stakeholders including business, labor, industry association and state and local governments.","Turning now to our outlook on Slide 9. Through the first half of 2012, Vulcan's adjusted EBITDA was $175 million, up from $123 million in the prior year. During the second half of 2012, Vulcan expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million, a $102 million increase from the second half of 2011.","Included in this second half improvement is approximately $23 million from gains from the routine sale of real estate that is not part of the Planned Asset Sales and savings from the restructuring initiative announced last year and completed during the first quarter of 2012.","For the balance of the year, we expect the year-over-year EBITDA improvement to be realized from cost reduction initiatives underway across the organization, including additional savings from the Profit Enhancement Plan, as well as the year-over-year improvement in second-half segment earnings in Aggregates, Concrete and Asphalt. We anticipate the controllable cost in the second half of 2012 will decrease by approximately $50 million from the prior year, which gives us $105 million in savings for the full year.","Full year SAG costs are now expected to be approximately $260 million.","For 2012, we expect earnings in each segment to improve from the prior year. We now expect the total aggregate freight adjusted selling prices to increase 1% to 3%. Aggregates demand should benefit from recovery in private construction activity and from the new Federal Highway Bill I mentioned earlier.","As a result, total company's same-store shipments are now expected to be up 1% to 3%, with the total shipments, that is adjusting for divestitures of Indiana operations last year, should be flat to 2% higher. The uneven pace of growth in shipments through the first half of 2012 across our key markets makes forecasting overall volume growth more challenging. The full year outlook assumes a more normal geographic mix of shipments in the second half of 2012.","Our non-aggregates segment earnings are expected to increase approximately $25 million compared to last year due mostly to improved earnings in Asphalt and Concrete. Asphalt earnings are expected to increase due to second half growth in shipments as a result of the timing of certain large projects in California.","For the Concrete segment, volume should continue to benefit from growth in private construction activity in the second half of the year. Cement earnings are expected to approach breakeven for the full year. Unit cost for diesel fuel are expected to increase modestly from the second half 2011 levels, resulting in a full year increase of 1% to 5% from last year.","Based on all of these assumptions, we expect 2012 EBITDA will be approximately $500 million, which excludes the results from the Planned Asset Sales and the cost associated with the unsolicited offer.","We expect capital spending in 2012 to be approximately $100 million.","In summary, we are encouraged by our second quarter results. Our cost-reduction initiatives are gaining traction and positioning us well for solid earnings growth in 2012. More importantly, these initiatives will improve the underlying cost structure of our organization and allow us to fully leverage the earning potential of a sustained recovery and demand.","Now I'll turn the call over to our operator to begin Q&A. Dan Sansone, Danny Shepherd and I will be happy to respond to your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","My first question is, I'm just wondering if we could dive in a little bit more on the weakness that you saw in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia in the quarter. I think it was a bit surprising the level of volume declines there. I'm just wondering, was it all weather driven, the pull forward into the first quarter, the rain in the second quarter, is there some market share loss going on there? I'm just wondering, a little bit more color will be helpful.","Danny R. Shepherd","Gary, this is Danny Shepherd. I'll answer your call. The first question you asked about demand in North Carolina and Georgia, North Carolina has remained weak for some time. As you know, we have a significant presence in the great -- presence in the greater Charlotte area, and that area of North Carolina has been weak now for some time. We do not have a major presence in eastern North Carolina, and large highway projects for the most part have been occurring in that part of the state. Switching to Georgia, Georgia has also been weak for some time now. Georgia had a hugely overbuilt residential sector. That sector is slowly improving. What remains hopefully a bright spot for us as we move through the year is in the highway sector. We have a reasonably good backlog in highway work as we travel through the summer. So hopefully, we will be somewhat stronger in Georgia in the second half.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I guess, just looking at your volume guidance that's been reduced this morning, you had about 3% volume growth in the first half of the year. And I guess, the new full year volume guidance implies something like a plus 1% to down 3% volume performance in the second half? I was just wondering if you can reconcile, given that in the prepared remarks, you're starting to see some improved trends in private and public demand. I'm just wondering where the disconnect is and why you're anticipating modest volume declines, broadly speaking, in the back half of the year?","Donald M. James","I believe our volume guidance for the second half of the year would be essentially flat, not down, and certain maybe up slightly on a same-store basis. The issue, of course, Garik, is timing of projects. We think there's a substantial amount of work in the pipeline coming from improvement in the private sector. We were surprised by both the large declines in the 3 states Danny mentioned but also by very large gains in many of our other markets. So there's a disparity in growth rates across markets, which we think will level out some in the second half, at least, our outlook is based on that. But we are -- we think contract awards for highways are down for the year about 5% to 7% largely because of the lack of any of the stimulus contract awards are no longer going out. But with the passage of the new highway bill, we think the significant new contract awards in the second half, whether they shift in the second half of 2011 or the first half of '13 is difficult for us to predict at this point. But we're not -- I don't think we see a disconnect in our macro outlook in our Aggregate volumes forecast.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just my last question is, on the $50 million reduction that you're looking for in controllable costs, just wondering how that relates to Profit Enhancement Program. And it seems like in the presentation, that it would be separate, and you would need this $50 million in the lower cost to help hit your guidance for EBITDA for the full year. But if you can provide some more color how -- whether or not there are some more costs that are being pulled forward from the Profit Enhancement Program into the back half of the year or just where this $50 million are coming from, that will be helpful.","Donald M. James","Well, in the first half, we got $55 million of controllable cost reduction. About $25 million of that was SAG and about $30 million was in cost of goods sold. Of the $50 million in the second half, again, about $25 million will come from SAG and about $25 million from cost of goods sold. A portion of that savings is coming from the form of Profit Enhancement Plan, but it's also coming from a very broad-based plant level and regional level initiatives that are helping us with our overall cost reduction effort. So it's a combination of the Profit Enhancement Plan plus the last year's restructuring and last year's SAG reduction efforts, as well as the ongoing Profit Enhancement Plan benefits.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Realistically, in Q2, how much does volume shortfall with a pull forward in demand versus the Florida storm?","Donald M. James","Certainly, there was a pull forward in demand from the very favorable weather in the first quarter. It's really hard for us to quantify that, but we know it exists. The issue in Florida from tropical storm Debby, I think, there were like 22 inches of rain that soaked the state, certainly, portions of the state. We don't have a number associated with that. Our volumes, as a Danny Shepherd said, in Florida, we're up double digit in the quarter. Clearly, they would have been up some more if it hadn't been for the impact of tropical storm Debby, but we really can't quantify that in any way that we think would be accurate.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","I think it will be safe to say that the pull-forward demand probably had a greater impact though?","Donald M. James","Yes, yes. Relatively I'm certain. I misunderstood that part of your question.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","And you said in your prepared comments, you expect additional pricing improvement in the second half. But our industry contacts are telling us that's increasingly more challenging to get pricing in a market. What are you seeing that maybe is a little bit different or is there maybe just degrees in terms of what type of pricing you feel you'd be able to get in the market?","Donald M. James","Well, as you know, in this industry, every market is different. It's a matter of what's going on in individual markets. Clearly, it is challenging in this market to get price improvement. We had very, very modest price improvement in the first half but some -- there is a geographic mix to pricing and we had a negative geographic mix for pricing in the second quarter. We think that will modify in the second half and we will get some benefit from a more normal geographic mix as it would flow through into pricing. Put another way, we have very good pricing in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and some of the states where we have the highest volume gains don't have a stronger pricing as some of those other markets. So that geographic impact to pricing is significant.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Okay. Now I know that kind of topic du jour is fiscal cliff and elections coming up. What are you doing -- a twofold question related to, these are facing the U.S. and us overall. Do you feel better or worse about demand given the hurdles that we face in the back half of the year? And are you doing anything differently to manage your business around those events?","Donald M. James","I'll go to the first question -- the second part of the question first. Clearly, we are very focused on controlling our cost. And without regard to what's happening with volume, we are committed to achieve the $50 million in additional controllable cost in the second half, totaling $105 million for the year. And then as we move forward into '13, the continuation of the benefit from our Profit Enhancement Plan. So we're doing that independent of political issues or demand issues. Actually, I think we -- with the passage of the federal highway bill, the certainty that gives to DOT's and the substantial increase in the TIFIA program, I think politically, we think we're more optimistic than we've been in several years in terms of the impact on our demand. We obviously are all affected by what is happening and may happen in Europe. But in terms of public infrastructure spending and what we're seeing in the housing markets, both multi-family and single-family housing, and increases in contract awards for private non-res, I think we are probably more optimistic today about the future than we've been in a long time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rodny Nacier of Keybanc Capital Markets.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Don, you commented on your expectation implied in your guidance that volumes are going to be flat in the second half. So I'm just trying to understand, it's going to be on a relatively tougher comp than the 2Q and with residential activity pretty evident in the first half and not too much volume growth and comps getting tougher in the back half. I mean, is it really a combination of residential private construction continuing to be strong and maybe some regional mixed dynamics going away?","Donald M. James","Well, full year, we think residential -- the demand from residential end markets will be up plus or minus 10%. Non-res up plus or minus 6%. Those are the areas that are positive. Highways, at least in terms of contract awards, will probably be down some, maybe plus or minus 6%. And so you balance all that out, infrastructure may be flat to down 1% or 2%. So when you run all that through our model, the improvement is coming from the private sector with some near-term weakness. Last year's third quarter was weak. We saw strength coming back in the fourth quarter, so that's -- as we're looking at comps from last year, we had a relatively weak third quarter and a relatively strong fourth quarter.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And with the bill -- I missed if you had said that changed your guidance for this year at all would be a transport bill being signed on the public side?","Donald M. James","No, that did not change our guidance. I think it gives us a lot of encouragement about the future, but we didn't change our volume guidance based on the passage of the highway bill.","Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And my second question is on the asset sale program that you have. Did you extend the timeline for the completion of the program for the $500 million. The tone in the release seems to be more cautious around the deadline. And secondly, do you have any assets that are classified as held for sale on your balance sheet as of now?","Danny R. Shepherd","Rodny, Danny Shepherd here. we have not extended the deadline that we had previously communicated, and we're working very aggressively to actually accomplish some things in the Planned Asset Sale category certainly this year. But no, the answer is no, we have not extended out our deadline.","Donald M. James","For the second part, we don't have assets held for sale on our balance sheet. There are rules for when you do that, and basically, the impact is you stop depreciating them so we don't have any on the balance sheet held for sale at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I was curious -- in terms of getting that sort of rough $25 million improvement in the non-aggregates piece, does that also assume the sale of any businesses or is that purely a function of better market and better operating performance with what you have?","Donald M. James","That does not include sale of any assets. That's operating for -- it's primarily -- it's not in the Cement segment, it's in the Asphalt and Ready Mix segment. The Asphalt Segment is -- will benefit from some projects that will begin in the second half. And the Concrete segment, we believe will benefit from the improvement in private sector demand, both residential and private non-res.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then, and just on the residential side, maybe more broadly speaking, just curious what you're seeing in terms of sort of community development, flat development and things like that?","Donald M. James","Well, it was a very market specific. I think there is probably less infrastructure development per housing start today than there was at the last time we saw housing starts pick up, but that will catch up. But there's obviously some of that, but that's not a huge factor right now, but it will obviously come back as some of the already developed lots get consumed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Analyst","I'm mostly focused on maybe you can give us an idea of what you think incremental margins are in the aggregate segment given that you're taking out so much cost during the remainder of the year?","Donald M. James","Incremental margin in the Aggregates business, you're looking for a full year number?","Unknown Analyst","Yes. How would you [indiscernible]?","Donald M. James","Yes. The guidance we have given has been about 60% in the Aggregates business. We're doing better than that year-to-date. And there's a lot of reasons for that, but I would go back to what Danny Shepherd said about the broad-based work our people across our regions are doing at the plant level. So 60% over some period of time is still a good number even though we're beating that year-to-date.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts of Jefferies.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to return, please, to the non-aggregates businesses. I mean I think, Don, you were talking about $25 million improvement. It was only up, I think, 2 in the first half. So there's a lot of progress needed here. My specific questions are really, I guess 2 or 3. Firstly, were there any other problem in projects or work contracts that you had in over the Asphalt business or the ready mixed that particularly have held it back in the first half and you won't have in the second half? And are you expecting significant price increases as well in ready mix or Asphalt that helps with that? And then the third question, really just look at the quantification, if you could, of the one-off cost that impacted the Cement business in the first half or in the second quarter.","Donald M. James","Mike, in the Asphalt business, the issue was the higher cost of liquid asphalt and the lag in getting that higher cost of liquid asphalt pushed through into our pricing. But in terms of an -- the problem with an individual project, we didn't have any of those. It's really the liquid asphalt impact. The liquid asphalt prices were up about 10% in the first half, which had a significant impact on the profitability. And we're looking for stronger volumes in both Asphalt and Concrete in the second half. I mentioned earlier in Asphalt, it's because of the timing of some larger highway projects particularly in California. And in Concrete, it's driven by the improvement in residential and private non-res construction, which is the larger user of concrete. We expect improved material margins in both Asphalt and Concrete. And the combination of volume growth and improved margins is the basis for our improved guidance in the second half. With respect to the cement plant, 2 things happened in the second quarter. One, we had a planned outage, which always impacts results in a quarter in which you have an outage because you don't have production for a period of time and you have increased R&M costs. And secondly, at the cement plant, we had a -- because of the storm, we had -- we lost power to the cement plant and that clearly disrupts production not just for the time that the power is out but then the time to get the plant back up following that. Danny, do you have any other...","Danny R. Shepherd","Well, I would add, Mike, early in the quarter, you know what it takes when -- you know what the time line looks like when you take a cement kiln down. So one way to look at it is we lost 10 days, roughly early in the quarter and we lost roughly 10 days late in the quarter because of the weather events. So hopefully, these are non-recurring. There are no planned outages, kiln outages at the cement plant in the near future.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Do you have a quantification of the cost of those 2 events, was it like $1 million or $2 million?","Daniel Sansone","Yes, roughly $1 million, we believe.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Don, if I could just return to the Asphalt question, 2 parts to it and my final question here, 2 parts to it. One, is the lag under the indexation roughly about 3 months or is it significantly different? And how do you locked in the liquid bitumin-- liquid asphalt cost for the rest of the year or you're still at vaguaries of what that price does?","Donald M. James","We have some portion of our liquid asphalt needs committed pricewise. And in some portion, we'll have to continue to buy on the  spot market. The lag in pricing, many of these projects are priced much further out than 3 months from the shipping date.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But the indexation, does that work on a 3-month basis or is it the indexation of the point?","Daniel Sansone","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question, Mike.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I mean, is the price recovery a question of waiting for the indexation to deliver the cost of increased asphalt, or is it you win and you work higher prices?","Danny R. Shepherd","No, the answer is no. We're expecting a significant improvement in California as Don talked about in his remarks. The work that -- a large percentage of the work that we expect to ship in the second half is indexed work in California, and that is -- that is something that's manageable.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Don James for closing remarks.","Donald M. James","Thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter conference call. We look forward to having you again after the third quarter. Thank you for your interest in our company and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation.

At this time, we'd like to welcome everyone to today's Vulcan Materials 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Don James, Chairman. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald M. James","Good morning, and thank you for your participation in our Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I'm Don James, Chairman of Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, our newly promoted President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McPherson, our newly promoted Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer.","Hopefully, you saw our July 14 press release announcing the election of Tom and John to their new senior leadership positions. These elections were the culmination of a multiyear management succession process by Vulcan's Board of Directors to develop a new senior leadership team with diverse and broad-based experience as well as demonstrated management success and leadership skills. The bios of the 4 members of our new senior leadership team are included in the July 14 press release. Importantly, you should note that each of these individuals has been successful as a line manager in at least one of our regional businesses. We are very pleased that this new team is now in place to lead the company.","In a moment, Tom and John will take you through our quarterly results and outlook for the remainder of the year as well as respond to your questions. Personally, I'll miss having the opportunity in the future to engage and interact with many of you about what makes Vulcan Materials Company such a great company with lasting value. While Tom and John, along with Mark Warren, our Director of Investor Relations, will be directly engaged with you on investor relations matters going forward, I will continue to be available to you and your organizations as requested.","I'm excited about the opportunities for Vulcan going forward, led by our new senior management team. Aggregates shipments have increased sharply year-to-date and have improved year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters. Our price improvement is widespread. More importantly, earnings are growing faster than our top line sales, and margins continue to expand. These results build upon the sales momentum we continue to see across our market footprint and are a credit to our employees. They have done an exceptional job of meeting our customer needs by providing a superior value proposition as we see a broad market recovery. Vulcan is extremely well positioned to benefit from the construction market recovery and to deliver value to our shareholders. And now is a great time to transition to our new leadership team.","Before we begin with actual results and projections, let me remind you that a slide presentation will accompany this webcast and will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.","Additionally, we remind you that certain matters discussed in this conference call, as indicated on Slide 2 of our presentation, contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in Vulcan's second quarter 2014 earnings release and at the end of this presentation.","Moving now to Slide 3. We had an excellent second quarter, and we're encouraged by the growing momentum in our markets. This slide shows the strong earnings leverage we realized on higher aggregates shipments. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.35 per diluted share, an increase of 52% compared to the prior year second quarter. On a comparable basis, our EPS in the second quarter was $0.37 per diluted share compared to $0.13 per share last year. Net sales increased $60 million or 9%, while gross profit increased $42 million or 32%.","These results reflect strong performance in our aggregates segment and improving results in our other segments. We remain focused on realizing earning leverage from price improvement, from cost control and from volume growth.","I'd now like to turn the remainder of the call over to Tom Hill.","James Thomas Hill","Thank you, Don. And also, welcome to Vulcan's Second Quarter Earnings Call.","Before we get into the details of the second quarter results, we would like to highlight the progress that we have made in our efforts to improve profitability.","Turning your attention to Slide 4. You see that, over the last 24 months, we've improved our EBIT by $169 million on just a 4% increase in aggregates demand. We are very pleased with this growth in earnings, and it highlights our commitment to cost control, pricing and customer service. We've improved our core profitability significantly, and we have positioned ourselves to capitalize on the accelerating volume recovery. We remain acutely focused on our profit-improvement actions and maximizing our strong operating leverage in this time of growing recovery.","Taking a closer look at the aggregates segment results on Slide 5. You see the resulting revenue and gross profit impact from higher shipments and pricing. Aggregates volumes increased over 10% and pricing increased 3% on a freight-adjusted basis. This, along with our expanded product offering in transportation and materials handling services, led to a 17% increase in segment revenue. In the second quarter, incremental earnings on higher aggregates volumes were in line with our longer-term expectations of approximately 60%. Transportation and material handling services, which are key to our aggregates business, generated higher sales and earnings versus the prior year second quarter.","Growing our transportation services, mainly truck brokerage services, has been a focus area for revenue and earnings growth. The truck brokerage requires little to no capital. These transportation services add incremental sales and earnings and allow us to better serve the needs of our customers. However, incremental margins are significantly less than earnings on each incremental ton produced and sold. That said, the earnings leverage on increased volume led to 27% higher gross profit in aggregates and a 210-basis-point increase in the percent of sales converted to gross profit. As a result, the key metric of cash gross profit per ton hit an all-time high of $5 per ton.","The broad nature of our volume improvement is notable. We saw a 10% volume increase for the second quarter. In particular, volumes in Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia exceeded 15%. Florida and Southern California also had above-average volume growth. We continue to experience volume momentum, as we've seen trailing 12-month volume growth of 8%. Our markets are seeing expanding growth in both volume and price. Aggregates shipments were up in virtually all of our sales regions, and the vast majority of our sales regions have realized higher pricing. This is evidence that volume and price growth are widespread.","Slide 6 highlights the favorable operating leverage in our aggregates business. Trailing 12-month volumes have increased 8% or 12 million tons, while aggregates gross profit improved 29% or $103 million. This is due to higher pricing, cost control and the earnings leverage on volume growth. This type of earnings leverage on modest volume growth is a tribute to our local management teams. Their continued commitment to earnings growth demonstrates their leadership and highlights the opportunities ahead.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Tom.","Now let's take a look at our conversion of incremental aggregates shipments into incremental profits in a bit more detail. Slide 7 compares our growth in aggregates shipments and our growth in segment gross profit for each of the second quarter, first half and trailing 12 months. In the second quarter, for example, we grew aggregates segment gross profits by $35 million over the same quarter a year ago, and we did that on just 4 million tons of increase in shipments. Looked at a bit differently, we added approximately $58 million in incremental direct revenue from aggregates shipments in the quarter, and the gross profit flow-through on those incremental revenues was approximately 60%, as Tom mentioned. Looking over longer periods, you see similar trends. Over the first half of 2014 and the trailing 12 months, we've grown segment gross profits at approximately 3.5x the rate of growth in shipments. As you've heard Tom highlight, our team, of course, remains very focused on growing profits at a rate well in excess of shipments.","Now let's go to Slide 8 to look at the strong and improving unit margins that underpin these results. This slide highlights our results on a per-ton basis. And as you can see, we've continued to improve our already strong unit margins significantly despite relatively modest price increases in the early stages of the recovery.","As Tom mentioned, second quarter cash gross profit per ton of $5 was a new record level for our aggregates business. At $4.51, our trailing 12-month cash gross profit per ton is 34% higher than it was at the end of the first quarter in 2006, our prior peak period in volume, when our annual rate of shipments was approximately 130 million tons higher than it is today. Again, these key unit profitability metrics demonstrate the successful efforts of our employees to increase profitability by controlling cost and delivering quality materials at a fair value to our customers. Looking at the second quarter, for example: Our freight-adjusted selling price rose by $0.33 or 3%. At the same time, our cash gross profit per ton increased by $0.36 or 8%, and our gross profit per ton increased $0.49 or 15%. For the quarter, most of the $0.16 differential between our average selling price gain and our gross profit per ton gain came from cost improvements, as our operators were able to offset higher repair and maintenance cost and stripping cost with other production efficiencies and by leveraging fixed cost to sales.","You will see that similar results hold if you look at the first half or the last 12 months. We believe our unit margins are among the highest and fastest growing in the industry, and we remain intensely focused on delivering strong and improving profits per ton as volumes recover. As a leadership team and as a company, we focus on the actual dollars and cents and not just the short-term percentage fluctuations because this higher unit profitability is what ultimately drives both higher earnings and higher returns on invested capital. And of course, these factors, combined with our presence in higher-growth markets and thoughtful management of our balance sheet, in turn, drive value for our shareholders.","Vulcan has the assets, people and performance focus needed to deliver similarly strong and improving returns on incremental shipments in the future, particularly as the recovery gets past its early days and as the pricing climate in many of our markets continues to improve.","Now I'll hand it back to Tom to touch on our other segments and our current outlook for demand.","James Thomas Hill","Thanks, John.","Next I'd like to talk briefly about our non-aggregates results, of which concrete and asphalt are highlighted on Slide 9. In the second quarter, our concrete segment's gross profit improved from a loss of $6 million last year to gross profit of $3 million in the current year. This year-over-year improvement resulted from sales of our Florida-area concrete business in the first quarter, from an 18% improvement in volume and from higher unit profitability in our remaining operations. On a like-for-like basis, volume and price improved, benefiting from growth in private construction activity.","In our asphalt segment, second quarter gross profit was in line with the prior year. Asphalt volumes increased slightly from the prior year, and material margins improved slightly due mostly to lower cost for liquid asphalt. However, drying costs and depreciation were higher than prior year.","Next, John and I would like to discuss the full year outlook. I will first give a few comments on our current forecast for aggregates demand by end market, and then John will give some highlights about key assumptions we have made regarding our full year earnings results.","Turning now to Slide 10. You see a breakdown of our expectations for aggregates demand by each of the major end markets. For construction, both residential and nonresidential continue to lead demand growth. In the private market segment, Vulcan-served markets are growing faster than the rest of the U.S. We expect residential growth to continue to be broad-based across our geography, led by key states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. We're also seeing residential construction activity and aggregate demand recover rapidly in important Vulcan markets such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte and Nashville. In private nonresidential, our markets are beginning to benefit from growth in office and commercial work as well as increased demand for large industrial projects. These industrial projects can represent large quantities of aggregates supplied over several years, and Vulcan is uniquely positioned to serve them. This is particularly true along the Gulf Coast, where we are advantaged by our ocean-shipped stone from Mexico. These projects provide an exciting opportunity for our aggregates business.","We're also seeing strengthening large-project opportunity in the public arena, including transportation infrastructure. Federally-funded TIFIA projects are beginning to drive additional aggregates shipments in 2014. State-led funding initiatives in several states, including Texas, Florida, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, will improve the highway segment demand.","We are pleased with the extension of the current highway bill until May 31, 2015, and the additional funding of $10.8 billion transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. Congress continues to work towards the ultimate passage of a new multiyear highway bill. In the meantime, large transportation projects and the growth in contract work for highways in 2013 and 2014 will provide steady growth in the demand for this market segment. Overall, we expect modest growth in shipments in the public end markets in 2014, and we're optimistic with respect to public infrastructure construction in 2015 and beyond.","Now I'll turn the call back to John.","John R. McPherson","Thanks, Tom.","So as you can tell, we're not only excited by our recent performance, but we're also very confident in the overall momentum we see across our markets, both for the balance of 2014 as well as into 2015.","Turning to Slide 11. I'll touch briefly on our current outlook for the full year before handing the call back to Tom. For ease of comparison, we formatted the slides similarly to the one in our February earnings call.","We now forecast full year volume growth to be 7% to 9% above the prior year. That compares to our prior forecast of 4% to 7% growth. Our backlogs and recent sales momentum remain quite strong. And although we remain far below any measure of normalized demand, the recovery appears to be gaining steam, and our local sales teams are doing an excellent job in growing our business.","We continue to see full year pricing up 3% to 5% over the prior year. Our recent pricing gains have been broad-based geographically, and as discussed, the overall pricing climate is improving across the majority of our markets. We're continuing to see improving prices as we book new business week-to-week and month-to-month.","We expect our other segments, which include asphalt mix, ready-mixed concrete and calcium, to report $40 million to $50 million of gross profit collectively for the full year, toward the lower end of our prior forecast. Our asphalt volumes in the Western U.S. have trailed plan due to delays in several key projects, pushing the revenue and profitability from those activities into 2015.","As previously indicated, full year SAG costs should remain in line with the prior year and lower on a percentage of sales basis. We remain very focused on continually improving the productivity of our sales and G&A investments. Full year interest expense remains unchanged at $165 million to $170 million, down from $202 million the prior year, not including the onetime charges associated with our debt tender transaction. We've revised our full year capital spending slightly from $220 million to $240 million. Given our current sales momentum and outlook, we have excellent opportunities to invest further in production efficiencies and distribution capabilities and to do so at very attractive returns. This capital spending will allow us to take advantage of those opportunities now and to prepare for the growth we see ahead of us.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for some final remarks.","James Thomas Hill","Thanks, John.","In closing, we are well positioned to capitalize on the multiyear recovery in demand that we believe is in front of us. And we expect 2014 to be another year of earnings growth. Thus far in this recovery, we have leveraged modest but accelerating volume growth into strong growth in earnings. This is due to the operating leverage in our aggregates business and the disciplined execution of our operations and sales teams. This performance by our teams gives us tremendous earnings upside as volume recovery continues.","John referenced opportunities to reinvest in our existing assets to enhance our profitability and grow earnings and returns. We are also very active in pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions. In July, we closed on a transaction that added 4 quarries that complement and grow our existing business in the San Francisco Bay Area. We're excited about these operations and look forward to their contributions to Vulcan's future results. We continue to see opportunities for bolt-on aggregate acquisitions. We will pursue these opportunities while staying disciplined in our approach.","Over the last 3 weeks, our senior management team has been traveling across the country meeting with our management teams throughout Vulcan's footprint. Our people are excited about Vulcan's future. They see what I see: a company that is in a new phase of robust growth that will be strategic and very rewarding to our employees and shareholders. The recovery that is occurring across America is encouraging, but our people are not waiting for recovery. They are making it happen every day, creating new opportunities for Vulcan to grow ever stronger and more profitable. Our people are totally focused on strategic growth, growing our volumes, growing our profitability and growing our footprint in the best markets in America. We are finding new opportunities every day, and our people are making the most of them.","I want to thank these employees for their outstanding contributions to Vulcan Materials Company. And I want to especially thank Don James for the critical role he has played to grow our business strategically and dramatically in fast-growing and high-potential U.S. markets. Don has led this company in good times and through turbulent times into recovery. Vulcan shareholders can have great confidence in our company. This confidence comes from our unparalleled asset base and from our outstanding people. They run the best and most profitable aggregates operations in the United States, and they are completely focused on building sustained shareholder value.","And now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Don, congratulations on an extraordinary career, and we wish you all the best in retirement.","Donald M. James","Thanks, Ted. I appreciate that.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was hoping maybe to start with John. John, could you maybe walk through a more detailed bridge of the gross profit improvement in aggregates? Just I know that you referenced to Slide 7, and I don't think the deck's available yet, but maybe if you could just walk us through kind of the impact of pricing volume. You mentioned stripping costs and repair and maintenance were up, but maybe benefits of restructuring and changes in inventory just so we can try and understand the puts and takes.","John R. McPherson","Sure. I'll just hit some highlights, and then Tom will chime in. First, just to get to the question of flow-through that many folks have asked: In the quarter, our incremental revenue from direct sales of stone, just as a reminder, was approximately $58 million. And on those revenues, our gross profit was approximately $35 million incremental gross profit, for a flow-through on the order of 60%. So just to answer that question directly, that's where our flow-through was in the quarter. Now going a little more into detail on the improvements in core profitability in the aggregates segment. And apologize, this will be detailed in the deck, if it's not available. Our gross profit per ton in the quarter was up $0.49, and our average selling price in the quarter was up $0.33. And again, that $0.16 differential is, in this quarter, mostly driven by cost improvements. And our operators did a fantastic job of leveraging volumes and driving some additional operating efficiencies. They overcame some headwinds and repair and maintenance costs and higher stripping costs. So we're very, very pleased with those results. We think our total gross profit per ton, when you look at it on a gross profit basis or a cash gross profit basis, is likely the highest in the industry, substantially higher, as in $1 or 30% higher than many others. And we also think it's the best at expanding in the industry. And we're pleased, actually, we're doing that despite relatively modest price growth. So Ted, let me stop there. Ask the additional questions, and Tom can chime in.","James Thomas Hill","Ted, I think, if you look at the quarter, we actually spent more dollars on stripping and on repairs, and that was really in preparation for the third quarter, where we'll see higher volumes. And that was to free up our operations to be prepared for that. But if you look at it on a per-ton basis, I think our operating folks did a really nice job with efficiencies. On a per-ton basis, even with the spinning on stripping and repair and maintenance, our per-ton cost was down.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Order of magnitude, could you give us a sense for the combined stripping and repair and maintenance costs just so we appreciate, ballpark, what that number would look like?","James Thomas Hill","Stripping was up, I think, about $0.02. And repairs and maintenance was about -- up about $0.045.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The second thing I was just hoping to touch on is pricing. I know you reported 3%, and you talked about broad-based gains. Could you maybe just help us maybe start by understanding the impact of geographic mix and product mix, to the extent that's possible? And just so we can get at what the underlying improvements and kind of go from there.","James Thomas Hill","Well, first of all, I don't think there was a lot of impact from mix. While our pricing in the second quarter was modest, it was broad-based. And we had pricing improvements in all but one of our markets. We think there's a lot of momentum with pricing, and we've had continuous pricing over time. I think, if you look at our trailing 12-month pricing, we were up in all but one market. And if you look back a year ago, trailing 12 months in '13, our prices were all up, all but one market. And then if you look back over time, Ted, we have had price increases in 13 of the past 14 quarters. So our pricing has been very steady. An exciting part about it is we are seeing pricing momentum in all markets, and that momentum is accelerating, so we're excited about that. But I think, ultimately, when it gets down to pricing, you have to put that together to look at margin. And we're really pleased with our teams' coordinated effort in the second quarter to blend price, volume, cost and product mix to maximize profit. And their effort generated a record cash gross profit per ton of $5. And while we're very pleased with that record, based on our pricing momentum and our efficiencies in operations, we're -- we don't think that record is going to stay on long.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. The last thing I'll ask before I get back is a question to come back to the margins. Well, as we look forward to the second half of 2014, would it be reasonable just to think about maintaining 60-plus-percent incrementals on the core aggregates business? Are there trends in cost we should think about? Or just any hand-holding there would be great. And I'll get back in queue.","John R. McPherson","I think the answer, Ted, is yes. This is John. 60% is appropriate to think through, through time. As we've said before, it may fluctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but the answer to your question is yes. And incremental revenues, particularly those revenues that come from direct stone sales or revenues that come from trucking-related activities, just to give a reminder, those are lower margin, but they have substantially no capital associated with them, and they effectively serve to add additional profit per ton sold. So for our direct stone revenues, 60% is not a bad number. And again, just to give you a sense, Ted and others, if you take a slightly longer-term view -- again, if you look at the trailing 12 months, our price has been up on the order of 3% average selling price, but our gross profit per ton is up 20%, 19% and change. And our -- and well, actually, our gross profit per ton is up about 20%. So ultimately, that's the money that we can either reinvest or give back to shareholders, dollars and cents per ton, and that's what we're very focused on.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. Looking at the aggregates business, I think that around 30% of your guys' volumes goes towards nonres construction activity, exclusive of roads, of course. Of that 30%, how much is going towards these energy infrastructure projects that you talked about along the gulf? I'm trying to gauge how much you guys stand to benefit from what's going on around there.","James Thomas Hill","I'm not sure I can give you that exact percentage. I'll give you some flavor on nonresidential. We're actually seeing the conventional nonresidential come back strong. When I say that, I mean shopping centers, buildings and things like that. We do have a number of large projects along the coast energy related, but a lot of those are just now getting started off. We're just starting to ship 3 of them on the Texas Gulf. And actually, the ones we had planned on shipping in Louisiana have been postponed to 2015, and while that's not good news for '14, it's excellent news for 2015. But if you kind of step back and look at the traditional nonresidential growth, and these are demands for what we project for 2014 over 2013: San Diego, we project demand to be up 50% in nonres; Baltimore, up 36%; Houston, up 32%; Fresno, up 32%; Miami, up 24%; Phoenix, up 20%; and Chicago, up 20%. So there's a lot of not traditional nonresidential growth out there that we're experiencing and excited about, and the big industrial projects that we're seeing are a bonus on top of that. And like I said, we backlog a number of those, but they're just beginning to ship, and we think we'll see the majority of those big industrial projects in '15.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. That's really good color. And then also, turning to SAG expenses. You guys continue to expect those will be flat year-over-year, which is really impressive given the revenue growth. And as we think longer term and net sales continue to grow, and how much -- what portion of your SG&A expenses are truly variable?","John R. McPherson","It's a good question. I think, actually, very little. I think the sales expense component of that, which is, let's call it, roughly $100 million of the total SAG numbers, probably slightly less than that, the sales expense will be more variable. Over time, we'll continue to invest in sales staff and sales-related expense to drive volumes and to critically drive profitability per ton sold to meet the needs of our customers. So that component's, to a degree, variable but still at a much, much, much lower rate. Then we'll grow shipments, and then we'll grow sales, and then we'll grow profits. We absolutely plan for SAG as a percent of sales to continue to decline substantially over the next several years.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","First of all, on pricing, just wanted to follow up in terms of you've seen -- given that you're seeing a greater breadth of projects now, not just an overlay of what you saw 3 to 4 years ago but more new projects and projects in all of your key 3 end markets, res, nonres and public, what is the differential in terms of the magnitude of price increases that you've been able to get for base product versus clean stone? That's part one. And then part two, how do you see that progressing, as we are in the earlier stages of recovery, in the both of the nonres and the public end markets?","James Thomas Hill","I think I understand your question. When it comes to base pricing and clean stone, in this part of the recovery cycle, normally, you're able to get higher prices on clean stone than base. This year, we are starting to see that turn, which is a really good sign in that we are seeing price increases, realizing price increases in base. And we're on the cusp of that, so we're very excited about it. The clean stone pricing continues to gain momentum, and the recovery will only help those prices.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Are you seeing a different -- difference in terms of your ability to get a greater percentage increase for base relative to clean stone, just clearly on a percentage-type base?","James Thomas Hill","Again, this part of the cycle, base is starting to catch up with clean stone. Clean stone, in prior quarters, has outstripped base price increases, but that is catching up and catching up rapidly.","John R. McPherson","And Kathryn, I think -- just to add, I think the answer to your question is yes. I think that the mix, over time, also helps us drive higher profitability per ton. So as you've heard from others, the mix is improving as the recovery goes forward too.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Yes. Shifting over just to public end markets, are you seeing DOT slowing in light of some of the noise we've seen around D.C.? I know we have a short-term fix. Our work certainly is not showing a meaningful change, but what are you seeing in terms of states where you have the greatest exposure, in particular how they're approaching being less reliant on federal and taking more responsibility for their own?","James Thomas Hill","Well, I think before the extension of the highway bill and the additional funding, there was a lot of nervous states out there. I think, with the extension until May of 2015 and the additional $10.8 billion, those states are much more comfortable and have gone on with their programs. We're seeing, I guess, improvement in a lot of states, in a number of states which I mentioned on the call, particularly Virginia and Maryland. Virginia raised the gas tax. I think they increased funding to $800 million a year. Maryland increased their funding over 6 years by $4.4 million. So we're seeing -- we're -- excuse me, $4.4 billion. We're seeing states take a much more active role in their own destiny when it comes to highway spending. And then you are aware that Florida announced over $10 billion in highway spending for 2014, 2015. And Texas just ended a record spending year for their highway funding. So it's encouraging, but I think the extension of the highway bill and the supplemental funding have helped the states relax their nervousness about highway funding.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Another follow-up question. This is -- can straddle both nonres and public, to some extent. But what are you seeing in your key markets in terms of volumes that are contributing to preparation for the Panama Canal expansion? And how do you see that progressing over the next 18 to 24 months?","James Thomas Hill","I'm thinking a lot of planning with not much action, at this point. I'd tell you that most of the ports we're seeing are talking a lot about it. People are -- have projects that they're planning, but not a lot of action at this point. There's also DOTs. For example, in Charlotte, South Carolina, they're talking about expanding the access to the ports. So it's in the very early stages of that and not seeing a lot of activity, more discussion and planning.","John R. McPherson","Kathryn, it's John. I think, maybe not in direct response to your question but just to add on, some of the incremental investment we're making in CapEx is focused on our blue-water distribution capabilities, readying our facility in Savannah, beginning to increase in capacity out of our Mexico operations, so forth and so on. So while it's not here just yet, we do see it as an important long-term trend. And we're well positioned and investing accordingly.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay, great. Then final question. On your truck brokerage services, how big do you want that business to be?","James Thomas Hill","Well, I think we still have growth in that. The focus of that business is to take an active role in managing our logistics. It allows us to save cost, improve customer service, and it also allows us to secure transportation in times when transportation is scarce. We're seeing a little bit of that out there, so we're pressing on. I'm not sure I could quantify the exact number, except for this was part of our Profit Enhancement Plan that we worked on, have been working on for the last 2 years, and just an extension of that.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","First question is just on your volume guidance. I think, previously, something that was maybe holding you back from not having a bigger guidance to start the year was some of these large Gulf Coast projects. You highlighted some are getting underway this year. Some are getting pushed out to next year. Was there any change in the cadence in these big projects that influenced your guidance? And then secondly, I guess, just a follow-up to the guidance question just because I don't believe the slide deck is yet up on the website, if you can just maybe identify which of the end markets is coming in specifically stronger than you had anticipated since the beginning of the year.","James Thomas Hill","As far as the large -- the mega projects, I don't think we're seeing a lot of timing differential on any of those. We backlogged a number of those and are very pleased with them. We're shipping some of those in '14. The lion's share will come in '15. But I don't think that's what changed our guidance. It's more the underlying demand in our fundamental markets, particularly nonresidential. When it comes to we upped our -- we increased our demand in the nonresidential markets, and that's really driven by the fundamental stores, buildings, office buildings that we're seeing in all of our major metropolitan markets.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And has there been any...","John R. McPherson","And Gary, just to be -- relative to prior guidance, just to add on, I think it's really despite a reduction in our housing outlook, although that's still quite strong and robust; despite some delays in those -- and just for projects in the Gulf Coast not coming through this year. Despite those things, which are still demand right there for '15, we're still raising our forecast. And so I think the message -- just that your takeaway should be that our underlying sales momentum, as Tom said, is very, very strong.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Actually, now I was going to ask about the housing piece, so that helps address it. And I guess just my other question would be related to uses of cash moving forward. If you could just maybe prioritize your view on additional bolt-ons, how that pipeline is looking and how you balance those opportunities versus potentially continuing to up the dividend and maybe taking a look at buybacks.","John R. McPherson","I'll start and let Tom chime in. We actually have a very attractive pipeline, as we've said before, of bolt-on acquisition opportunities. And those investments are both attractive in their own right and improve the returns from the rest of our asset base. So we'll continue to pursue those in a very sensible and disciplined way, the recent acquisition in the Bay Area being a very good example. But over time, and I think has been -- as has been the legacy of Vulcan, we'll have a balanced mix between reinvesting capital in the business and returning it to shareholders. The exact form of that return, dividend, share repurchase, what have you, is really a board decision and something we'll work through over time, but you can expect us to have a balance of returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting in what we think is the most valuable aggregates footprint and set of market positions, arguably, in the world.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I guess just one last question. Just quickly, Tom, you mentioned you're starting to see a little bit of trucking constraints in your transportation businesses, supposedly set to address some of those issues. If you could provide a little bit more color around that issue and how significant of a risk this could be as volumes come back into the system potentially faster than anticipated.","James Thomas Hill","Well, in this part of the cycle, I think trucking shortages are always out there. We're hearing some rumblings down in some markets. We don't have a lot of concern about that. We have ample trucking resources, but those -- when those shortages happen, they are cured very quickly. The market responds fast, with trucks coming into the market when prices go up. So we don't think there's significant risk when it comes to trucking. Actually, it's probably an opportunity for us because, if there is a shortage, we control, based on our strategy of truck brokerage, a number of those trucks, so we feel like we'll be served first. As far as transportation shortages in rail, again, in this part of the cycle, that's a possibility. We get comfortable with that because we have so much flexibility on numerous rail line, but also, we control our own destiny in a lot of those markets with brown-water and blue-water sources, where we can mix and match supply.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you gentlemen are willing to step us through what parts of your network have you rolled out the truck brokerage business model. And for areas where you've rolled it out, what's the penetration rate today versus where it could ultimately be? And perhaps you could calibrate us on the margin profile. I guess the standalone truck brokerage companies are running in the mid to high single-digit range, and I'm wondering if you could calibrate us relative to that benchmark.","James Thomas Hill","Our trucking business, like our aggregates business, is a local business. Each one is different. Each one is structured different, and the profitability at each one is different. We are active in California. We're active in Texas. We're active with this in the Midwest. We are active within the Southeast. But as far as trying to put a number on the percentage profitability, again, it varies by market and it varies widely by market.","John R. McPherson","It is safe to say it's well below, on a percent-of-sales basis, our core stone business, which is why we're trying to give you some transparency to it. But again, reminder, we're not owning trucks. It's very low capital for us. So we think of it as incremental returns to us and, on that basis, very attractive.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, absolutely. I guess that we're just trying to understand how much runway you have in front of you. Maybe you could quantify what proportion of your shipments do you currently handle with the truck brokerage operation in areas where you're relatively far along that process, just so we can think about what the ultimate opportunity from Vulcan's standpoint is.","James Thomas Hill","I think, at this point, it's a small percentage of our aggregates. We have a lot of growth in this area. And most importantly, this is to secure transportation and secure customer service as well as lower cost. But we have a long ways to go from a trucking perspective.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'm wondering if you could talk about, within aggregates, just the cadence of price realizations from here based on the mix of jobs that you have coming up in the back half of the year. Can you just give us a flavor for what you expect to ship based on visibility that you have and how the pricing levels compare versus a year ago?","John R. McPherson","Okay, I'll start and let Tom give a little more flavor. As I mentioned in the script, I think what we're seeing week-to-week, month-to-month in pricing is very positive. The climate -- or pricing climate's improving in the vast majority of our markets. It's always a little bit difficult to predict for us the exact cadence because you've heard -- as you've heard us say before, we don't manage pricing in any kind of centralized way. That said, and Tom can give a little bit more flavor, all of the signs across the vast majority of our market, the lights are flashing green in terms of the improving pricing climate. And so again, we're very pleased with the gross profit per ton improvement our guys have delivered, given steady 3% pricing. And we're pretty darn excited about what those numbers can be when we get higher pricing flowing through.","James Thomas Hill","We are excited about the pricing momentum. And when I say that is it continues to grow. And part of that is just the feel from our customer base. They are more confident in the market. They're more confident in their profitability, which allows pricing momentum for the aggregates business.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I'm wondering if you could just touch on the concrete business that you have remaining in the portfolio, where -- can you talk about the competitive landscape in terms of -- I guess, I would think, with cement capacity utilizations improving, we should see greater pricing momentum in concrete than areas where your competitors are vertically integrated. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing pricing accelerating further in concrete, where you are vertically integrated?","James Thomas Hill","In the second quarter, we experienced good pricing increases in concrete. We think that, as the residential and nonresidential, the private sector, grows, the margins in our concrete business will continue to grow, just as in aggregates. And we're excited about it.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Market.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First question is, Illinois, you call out for the volume strength there, which I suppose might be a little surprising. What's driving the good volume performance there? Is it just good weather after a tough winter?","James Thomas Hill","Well, good weather always helps, Jack. But what's really driving those volumes is large projects. We've secured and are shipping on a number of large transportation and infrastructure projects and O'Hare airport projects, which is helping our volumes. But we're starting to see the residential improved in West Chicago and think that will come on strong in the next 6 months to the next 18 months.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. I guess this question might be for John. You made a lot of comments around CapEx and the slight increase there. I know you won't give guidance for CapEx for next year, but I mean, do you see more of these types of projects? Do you think CapEx, given volume recovery trends, up a bit over time? Maybe, directionally, some commentary might be helpful.","John R. McPherson","Yes, I think, directionally, CapEx is not going to trend up substantially over time on a per-ton basis. Obviously, we'll raise it as we support higher volumes, but nothing that we see, from a, guess I'm going to call it, replacement operating CapEx view, has changed beyond kind of past experience. So I think those trends will continue. We'll continue to have opportunities to invest in growth: capacity additions, additional reserves, additional distribution facilities. And so I think we'll have smart opportunities for adding to our portfolio and for building out our network, but the core CapEx, the core replacement CapEx, those trends, I think, will remain the same.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Because it seemed like, the increase, you were calling out some very specific opportunities rather than the need to make some broader investments.","John R. McPherson","It's more specific -- yes, thank you, John. Let me be more clear. It's more specific opportunities than it's any kind of fundamental change. We just wanted to be complete in the guidance, frankly. So it is additional capacity in Mexico. It's a rail yard in Savannah. It's some additional land and reserves around things we've recently acquired. It's growth- and profit-adding type capital, not any change in our fundamental operating CapEx.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Getting back to some of the truck brokerage revenues you referred to, can you give us any kind of sense of how much that's grown in the year-over-year in the second quarter and how much in the first half?","John R. McPherson","I think, let me give you kind of, I'm going to call them, the revenues that are from all of our transportation-related activities. I'm going to -- so the revenues in our aggregates segment that are not from direct stone sales. And just to give you a rough sense, those revenues in the quarter -- and again, this is the revenues in the segment that aren't from -- that you wouldn't get if you multiplied tons times average selling price. And for the quarter, that was on the order of $112 million of revenue. Prior year quarter, that was about $83 million in revenue, so about a 35% increase.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So a good increase. And what would it be for the year-to-year then?","John R. McPherson","I don't -- for the year-to-date, I don't have it right here, but we could easily get it to you. I think, for the 6 months ended, it's about $192 million of revenue versus approximately $143 million of revenue in the prior year.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And if we -- that's close enough. I hear what you're saying.","John R. McPherson","But again, just to be clear, that's not all trucking. That includes some shipping-related revenue and some other transportation-related revenue.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","No, you did the -- or what's in the aggregates. That's what the [indiscernible]...","John R. McPherson","Yes, yes. And...","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","If we go back several years ago, how much has that revenue grown, and just general sense? You don't have to give me specific numbers. How much, in a general sense, has that grown from pick whatever time. Has it been exponential growth? Or is this recent growth we're seeing kind of new?","John R. McPherson","I think the trucking components of it, as opposed to some of the shipping components, is exponential growth but, again, starting off a very low base. So I think what we're focused on is less the revenue growth, given the nature of this, and more the incremental gross profit we derive from it. And at the end of the day, it increases the gross profit that we receive per each ton that we sell. And as Tom said, we've got a good ways to go on that incremental gross profit. We're pleased with the results so far, but we're still in the early stages of this effort.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second question. We've talked a little bit about the highway bill, with the extension through May of next year. Given that it was another short-term extension, going back to the old days of short-term extensions, what are you hearing from the states as they think about spending for next year? Is this changing their plans at all? Or do they just expect something longer extended after this May patch is done?","James Thomas Hill","Well, first of all, I don't think we're hearing any negativity from the states based on the extension we got. That's a pretty substantial extension to May with the $10.8 billion. So that buys them a lot of time. I think we're all cautiously optimistic that Congress will get a bill done in 2015. There's a lot of momentum in the capital for getting a highway bill, a long-term highway bill with strong funding. And you're seeing both parties in support of a long-term bill with more substantial and more solid funding. So in the states, you're seeing this also, so I don't -- we don't detect any kind of nervous behavior out of the states at this point.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies.","Michael Betts","I had 2 questions, if I could, please. The first is just on asphalt. And it had a great first quarter, not such a good second quarter, which you said was due, I think, to delayed projects in the West. I guess I'm trying to look at the outlook for the rest of the year. Is it likely to be more like the second quarter, with anemic growth with pretty much these big projects delayed? And what has caused those delays, if I could ask, please? And then secondly, you mentioned the 4 quarries you've acquired in San Francisco Bay Area. Can you give us some idea of either size of the investments or size of quarries, what sort of -- what we're looking at there? And with the acquisition costs referred to in the second quarter, were they related to that acquisition?","James Thomas Hill","Just taking the asphalt first, the jobs are in California. They were state jobs that actually just delayed for the state. It's not that we won't do those jobs. We're just not going to be able to have those jobs in 2014. We'll service those jobs in 2015. We're pleased with our asphalt performance. Over time, it gives us very nice returns. As far as how we see the year going forward, I think our asphalt business will have better quarters than we did in the second quarter, but again, the volume will affect that. The quarries that we purchased in the San Francisco Bay Area, they were -- there were 4 operations, 2 of which were operational. We acquired about 120 million tons of permitted reserves, which, as you know, is very important and hard to do in California. So we're very pleased with them. It's complementary to our operations in the Bay Area, and we look forward to having those operations in the Vulcan family. As far as our price, that's confidential, and we could not reveal that.","Michael Betts","Understood. Can you reveal the sort of annual production? Is it a couple of million tons? Is that the sort of level that you're seeing coming out of those at the moment?","James Thomas Hill","Probably a little under 1 million tons at this point.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley S. Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Most of the questions have been answered. So quickly, for the analyst event coming up in September, can you guys give us any sort of high-level thoughts on what investors should expect as we're heading into the event, by chance?","John R. McPherson","I think, as you'd expect, we would like to take the advantage just to, frankly, as a new management team and new leadership team, have a chance to interact with the investment community longer than we can in a call or another meeting. And we'd also like to lay out what our vision is as a management team for what the company can do going forward. You should not expect it to be some dramatic announcement of a strategy shift. That's not it, but we would like to tell you where we think the company can get to in 1, 3 and 5 years. So that's the kind of discussion you should expect.","Operator","Thank you. Now I would like to turn today's call back over to Tom Hill for some closing remarks.","James Thomas Hill","Thank you very much for your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. We're excited about the markets and the demand going forward. And we look forward to seeing you and talking to you in the third quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
