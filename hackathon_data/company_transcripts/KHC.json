At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, please go ahead.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our business update for the fourth quarter of 2015. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO; Paulo Basilio, our CFO; and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation available on our website.","Also please note that in 2015 we had a 53rd week, so on the charts in today's presentation we've excluded the extra week from our organic net sales growth figures, and we've provided our estimate of the impact on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS within each of those bars.","With that out of the way, let's turn to slide two, and I'll turn it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our results and talk about the year ahead, I want to provide context to today's conversation by reviewing our goals and strategies.","As you know from our last call, our strategy is based on three objectives: profitable sales growth, achieving and maintaining best-in-class margins, and a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company. This is our multi-year plan on one page, and it is important to understand that not everything starts to deliver at once. In some cases, like revenue management, it's not a project. We must build an internal capability before we can achieve sustainable results in return.","So, with that as the background, let's turn to slide three to talk about where are we on our journey. Overall, 2015 was a year of significant accomplish for Kraft Heinz. We came together as one global organization and began building on the rich history of our dynamic company. The integration team executed an extensive action plan with two main objectives: one, operating as one company with one set of goals and business objectives; and two, achieving solid alignment on the 2016 budget, built from the bottom up by country and field teams.","In many ways, we are pleased with what did not happen in 2015, namely business disruption. We made difficult but necessary decisions around organizational restructure that will improve our efficiency, making Kraft Heinz more competitive and accelerating our investments in our brands, products and people.","We have already made solid investments in our people, promoting more than 2,400 team members worldwide, and introducing a new long-term incentive program that gives many employees the opportunity to increase their ownership in the company. In short, our vision, values and process are building the culture of ownership and empowerment necessary for the long-term achievements of our company.","We have also made significant investments in our world-class brands. We were successful with Big Bets and innovations like Lunchables, P3, Heinz Yellow Mustard, Sauces in Europe and Mayo in Brazil, and we continued to support strong levels of investment in R&D to carry forward Big Bets in 2016 and 2017.","Finally, we made meaningful progress across our global operations. We significantly improved our case fill rate in United States and Europe to over 97%, our best performance in both the legacy Heinz and legacy Kraft business in quite a while. We delivered solid EBITDA and margin gains based on savings for manufacturing footprint efficiencies and improved product mix, and we achieved strong performance in the U.S. cheese and meat business, effectively managing pricing net of commodity costs. This led to the establish of a solid financial base for the new Kraft Heinz Company that we believe can grow strongly and sustainably.","Before I go to our agenda for 2016, I'm going to ask George and Paulo to talk about how we landed 2015 and provide a deeper update on the overall status of our key business. George?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide four, I will begin by saying that we are feeling good about the state of our U.S. business, and our ability to generate profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. And that's despite a sizable step-down in volume and mix performance in Q4.","So why am I optimistic? Several reasons. First, we're driving profitable net sales with significantly lower promotional activity versus Q4 2014. As you can see on the slide, we drove solid 1.2% non-promoted consumption in Q4 and 1.5% non-promoted consumption for the full year for our combined portfolio in the United States. This was driven by innovation, new product news and an increase in working media behind ketchup, pasta sauces, Lunchables, P3, cold cuts, single-serve coffee and cream cheese.","Secondly, our shipments were below consumption in the fourth quarter. This was due to shipment timing versus prior period, and mainly related to comparisons with Q4 last year when for instance we were filling the retail pipeline ahead of our launch of McCaf\u00e9 as well as the business losses in the foodservice highlighted on our last call. But this is now behind us, and we are pursuing a solid development plan for our foodservice business in 2016.","Third is the fact that our integration initiatives are beginning to have an impact, with organizational structure savings contributing to EBITDA growth in Q4. And looking forward, savings from ZBB should begin to be realized across our combined operations, and modernization and capability building within our manufacturing footprint should ramp up significantly.","Finally, I am also confident about our prospects because of our robust innovation pipeline, Big Bets, and my belief that we are well-positioned to build on our 2015 accomplishments in 2016. In particular, we'll become even more equipped and more focused on putting products and investable marketing ideas into the marketplace against some of our biggest turnaround opportunities.","I'm not going to tell you that we have a solution for every part of our portfolio just yet, but I do believe our pipeline is in better shape to commercialize trend-bending product into the marketplace, and we will be in even better shape as we execute our footprint initiative over the next two years.","Let me give you a few quick examples of what to look for on your next round of store checks. Capri Sun Organic is now in the marketplace, with advertising scheduled to hit later in the second quarter. We're making changes to ensure that Mac & Cheese is more relevant today than ever before, with no artificial flavors, preservatives or synthetic colors. And you will hear us making noise about this very soon. Also, we're working to improve our nutritional frozen meal offerings, which we will talk about later in the year.","We will support these and other Big Bets with a solid increase in working media dollars. I hope you all saw our Meet the Ketchups campaign that we kicked off during the Super Bowl. It is part of a major marketing campaign behind Heinz Ketchup. We expect 2016 will be a strong marketing year for us, including a further shift of our advertising spend from non-working to working media, with our goal of increasing working media to at least three-quarters of our marketing budget.","With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide five to talk about the key factors impacting our total company performance for both Q4 and full year 2015.","One of the biggest factors impacting our reported results all year was a strong negative currency translation, an impact that grew to the 6% range on the top line and 9% to 10% of EBITDA beginning in the third quarter, when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar. And we expect this to continue through the first half of 2016.","Net pricing was neutral to favorable in all segments in both Q4, for the full year. This was driven by a combination of price increases and taking out inefficient trade spending, partially offset by lower net pricing related to lower net commodity costs across our big four commodities in the U.S. and Canada. And with dairy prices remaining low, this is something we are likely to see continue into the first half of 2016.","We had negative volume\/mix in the U.S., Canada and Europe that offset strong growth in Rest of World.","The volume\/mix decline accelerated in Q4 but mainly due to factors not expected to repeat and I'll talk more about those with our segment results.","At the EBITDA line, we delivered strong growth in Q4 and the full year driven by restructuring and integration savings, expanding our adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 200 basis points for the full year.","Dropping down to adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.62 did benefit by approximately $0.03 from the 53rd week, but this was more than offset by roughly $0.10 from unfavorable tax impacts.","In Q4 this year, we incurred tax expenses related to the repatriation of foreign earnings, done as part of our legal structure integration process. This pushed our Q4 implied tax rate into the mid-30s, and for the full year to just over 30%.","By contrast, in 2014 we had favorable tax impacts that drove implied tax rates on Adjusted EPS into the mid-20% range for both Q4 and full year. That being said, we continue to believe that an effective tax rate of approximately 30% is fairly representative of our average rate on an ongoing basis.","That's the total company, let's turn to slide six and our U.S. segment results. You can see here that we had sequentially weaker organic net sales growth in Q4. This was due to weaker overall volume\/mix. The primary sources of the volume\/mix decline were consistent with what we've seen all year. Category trends and volume loss associated with higher net pricing in ready-to-drink beverages, powdered beverages and boxed dinners. Category and market share declines in nutritional frozen meals. And lower foodservice shipments due to lost bids at some key customers.","In Q4, two other factors resulted in unfavorable comparisons and a further year-on-year decline in volume\/mix. One, shipment timing meaningfully impacted by the pipeline shipments for the launch of McCaf\u00e9 last year. And two, we executed significant promotional activity in Q4 2014, particularly in parts of our cheese and spoonable portfolios that we chose not to repeat this year. Looking forward, we don't expect either of these factors to hold back our Q1 volume\/mix performance.","By contrast, growth in pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. accelerated in Q4, as did adjusted EBITDA margins on both year-over-year basis and sequentially versus Q3. Consistent with the full year, the U.S. benefited from a combination of favorable pricing net of costs and lower overheads.","In Q4, our adjusted EBITDA growth and margins picked up momentum from a combination of increased integration savings and better overhead cost performance as the unfavorable bonus accrual comparisons we faced in Q3 faded.","In Canada, on slide seven, our results continued to reflect a double-digit currency translation headwind that grew as the year progressed, as well as challenges to increase prices to offset higher input costs in local currency terms.","Our price realization improved in Q4 relative to full year. However, volume\/mix declines drove organic net sales growth into negative territory. For the year, this was mainly caused by lower shipments in foodservice, refreshment beverages and infant nutrition.","In the fourth quarter, the decline in volume\/mix was greater, primarily due to comparisons with prior year in foodservice and coffee, including last year's launch-related shipments of McCaf\u00e9. Adjusted EBITDA in Canada was relatively flat for the year but up mid-single digits in Q4. This reflected the fact that our price realization had caught up to higher local input costs.","That being said, our Canadian business is facing further local cost inflation in many categories, and this month we are implementing additional pricing actions to offset the higher costs.","Turning to Europe on slide eight, while currency translation remained unfavorable, it was slightly less of a drag on our reported results in Q4 than what we had seen most of the year. Beyond currency, the drivers in Europe remained largely the same in Q4 as it had been year-to-date. Net pricing gains from strategic pricing in ketchup and mayonnaise across a number of markets offset by lower volume\/mix.","In terms of volume\/mix, despite a significant improvement in our product mix, volume\/mix was down in the mid-single digits for both the year and Q4. This was primarily driven by volume declines related to cutting inefficient promotional activity in UK beans, price increases in ketchup and ongoing consumption declines in Italy infant nutrition.","In addition, we experienced lower UK soup shipments in Q4 due to a combination of three factors: one, our own efforts to reduce low-return promotional frequency; two, competitors moving to increase price-based competitive activity to gain market share; and three, all this happening during unseasonably warm weather at the start of the soup season.","While this scenario will likely remain a challenge for us in Q1, we're now putting in place plans to drive better soup consumption and defend market share. In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings combined to deliver double-digit, constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the year. And we did this while significantly increasing working media during the year.","So overall, we feel good about the health of our European business and will continue to invest in profitable growth as we move forward.","Finally is Rest of World on slide 9. Here negative currency translation remained at an elevated level in Q4, roughly 33% of net sales and 56% at EBITDA, consistent with the increased impact we saw in Q3 when we recognized the devaluation of the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar. And at current exchange rates, this is likely to continue during the first part of 2016.","Organic net sales grew more than 9% in both Q4 and the full year, with volume\/mix gains getting stronger as the year progressed. For the year, volume\/mix growth was driven by strength in ketchup, condiments and sauces across all regions. And these gains more than offset declines in our Complan nutritional beverages business in India.","In the fourth quarter, better consumption trends in both Asia and Latin America drove increased volume\/mix growth. At EBITDA, we posted strong constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth for both Q4 and the full year, driven by volume gains, mix improvement, as well as cost savings from ZBB and manufacturing footprint efficiencies.","Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on both synergies and capital structure.","I'll start with synergies on slide 10. Overall, we remain on track in each of the three areas of our integration program, organizational structure, ZBB and manufacturing footprint. In 2015 we incurred $829 million of costs, with roughly two-thirds of those costs related to severance and employee benefit.","And we spent only about $225 million in CapEx related to the program.","Our estimate of the total costs to achieve our targeted savings remains the same: $1.9 billion of pre-tax costs, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of cash costs and roughly $800 million in non-cash expenses like asset write-offs and accelerated depreciation, and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization.","I would also note that, in 2016, we expect capital expenditures to ramp up considerably as we begin to roll out the bulk of our footprint initiatives. As a result, the majority of the costs to achieve our program will be spent in 2016.","As far as savings, we realized roughly $125 million of savings in 2015. And we continue to target, and remain confident in our ability to deliver aggressive cost savings of $1.5 billion net of inflation by 2017.","Turning to slide 11, I'm pleased to share that our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share today. In addition, we ended 2015 at just over 4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA including preferred stock, and are confident we can deliver against our goal to reduce leverage to less than three times adjusted EBITDA over the medium term.","An important step in that process will be refinancing our preferred stock when it becomes callable in June. And at current interest rates, this would be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective for the company.","I'll now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our prepared remarks.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Paulo. Turning to slide 12, let's talk about what we expect to face in the year ahead. Similar to what we saw in 2015, we expect currency and consumption trends to remain meaningful headwinds across most markets in the year. And as Paulo told you our general managers from Canada to Asia will continue to face pressure to increase prices in many categories to offset higher input costs in local currency.","There is also the ongoing need to drive better consumption in the face of both consumer weakness and consumers' desire for fresher, less processed food. All that said, we're very excited about how Kraft Heinz is positioned.","To unleash growth, we will continue to focus on innovation, go-to-market capabilities and increasing working media dollars. We'll build our innovation pipeline through big bets in each market, and as the year unfolds, you'll see us launch advances in areas where consumers are migrating.","Importantly, we'll continue to take a portfolio approach within the key categories in which we compete, from premium to value offerings, to meet consumer demand across the spectrum.","On the cost side, we expect to make significant progress on delivering best-in-class margins through: one, delivering ZBB savings; two, making progress on our manufacturing footprint initiatives; and finally, building a real performance driven culture in Kraft Heinz.","It's still early, and as we evolve, I will continue to share our plan. Overall, this is an exciting and challenging time for The Kraft Heinz family. In 2015, we took steps to build a solid base for sustainable growth. We are executing a strong pipeline of initiatives in 2016 and our synergy plans are laid out throughout 2017, which will create an even bigger opportunity to invest in our people, our brands and our products.","Overall, we are confident that the company is on track towards our vision to be the best food company, growing a better world.","Thank you. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the comment that you've realized $125 million in savings but you're still targeting $1.5 billion overall because the $125 million's a pretty small percentage of that $1.5 billion, so I'm curious how are you getting such a big EBITDA margin improvement if you've barely scratched the surface on that $1.5 billion? Are the benefits to margins, and maybe this is an obvious answer, but are they coming from drivers outside that number? Lower promotions or what? And I'm just curious to get a little bit of color on that one.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken. This is Paulo. Thanks for the question. I think, actually when you think about our EBITDA margin improvement, it comes from mainly three items. The first thing is price net of commodity that you have in the quarter. We had also some footprint optimization that we saw realized in Europe, and also the reduction in promotion that we stopped doing that we did in the prior year. So on top of that we had also this $125 million in the quarter, important to state this number. We saw the benefits of $125 million in the quarter, so it's one quarter of savings, but those were the main items that we got to increase our EBITDA margin.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on. I know the call is long.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a question about the revenue; I think one of the things we've heard quite a bit over the last few months is a concern that as the cost savings and the margin start to expand, that you'll get a downdraft on revenues similar to what you've seen in Heinz, and I think today the organic sales growth was a little bit below where people were expecting. So could you just sort of talk about how this is different from what you experienced at Heinz? And then also, if you could just clarify how much the shipment timing affected the overall sales comp? Thanks.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan. It's Bernardo. I think it's important, as we highlighted in the remarks, to go to the specific items of the fourth quarter, right? Paulo read we went from all the regions on the specifics. And there were some challenged categories like frozen meals or soup in U.K., but when you see our market share performance and so on, we have been growing quite stable in most parts of that. So most parts what you're seeing, we saw a lot of really leaving negative ROI initiatives that really didn't support the company for the long run as we continue to build the pillars and push us to really a profitable sales agenda. As I always said and it's important to remind, we're a sales organization.","And with that in mind, what I can tell you that I think it's \u2013 from the highest comparison you made in the beginning and so I think there are a lot of difference in a positive way. First, we are pushing this agenda of innovation, of go-to-market capabilities and higher marketing dollars in a much faster pace than we did at that time, okay? And second, we're actually feeling good about the first quarter of the year and our objectives for 2016 and beyond on pushing this agenda.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just if you could clarify how much of the shipment timing in the U.S., just to \u2013 what effect that had on the comp?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, Bryan, this is George Zoghbi here. The shipment timing in the U.S. in Q4, as I stated in my pre-prepared remarks, was affected by three things when you look at the comparisons. One is one-off items that we did last year in preparing to the launch of McCaf\u00e9. That was a big one for us. The second one is we did not do promotional activities that we did in Q4 of 2014. And the third one, in alternative channels we exited businesses that we won't be overlapping moving forward. So moving forward, you're going to see that the shipment sales and the consumption sales will be closely aligned.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening, everybody.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","This is the second quarter in a row where KHC saw positive pricing net of costs in every region, despite obviously negative \u2013 pretty negative input cost trends. So I'm trying to get a sense of how this has been achieved given it's kind of a different outcome than maybe we would have seen from Kraft in the past. And is this sustainable in this type of input cost environment? That's the first.","And then just second would be just what did you mean on that one slide about some execution or improvement in sales force execution? Just curious if that changes that sort of in-store activities at the corporate level. What was meant by that would be helpful. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Andrew, this is George. Thank you for your question. Yes, we are very pleased with the work we did on PNOC, not just in Q4 or the last two quarters that you have mentioned, but right throughout 2015, particularly in dairy, in meat, in coffee. And we believe the strength of our brand equities and the investment that we have been making and we continue to make in these brands is allowing us to do that.","Do we feel that it's sustainable? Yes, we do. And the reason we feel it's sustainable because while we were doing this and PNOC's been healthy and positive for us, if you look at our market share, which you have access to, we managed to grow share in all these categories. For example, we grew share in cream cheese, we grew share in processed, we grew share in American slices, we grew share in Oscar Mayer meat combos, we grew share in snack nuts and seed, we grew share in coffee. Dairy is where we lost some share, softening in natural cheese and hot dogs and it was our willingness not to chase the market down.","So that's, if you want, the reasons why we believe what we did is sustainable and without strong brands we won't be able to do that.","That's the first part. The second part of your question, we are now of a size where we believe that assessing our market, go-to-market model and sales by focusing on our capability to cover more areas and be more extensive and the frequency, of course, would be higher would allow us to do more. So we are experimenting with some models that we'll be in a better position to share with you later on in the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good evening, everybody. I guess I have first, like a, basic question, a broad question and then a more specific one. In terms of the, I think, Paulo, you mentioned higher CapEx to deal with the footprint. So I assume the way the savings in 2016 and 2017 are going to flow as a result of that, first will be more SG&A related, and then maybe in 2017 it will be more cost of goods, given the footprint changes, and so I'm wondering, is that correct?","And then two, can you say what are the incremental savings you expect in 2016, so we have more of a bridge between the two years? And then I have a technical follow-up question.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Eric. We are not breaking down the phasing of the savings because that cannot match the quarter (32:38) one week or one month delayed. So what we have normally happen is and what happened last year is, we start with the org restructuring and we saw already in the last quarter the savings flow into our results. And then we have together the ZBB and the footprint happening just right after, and the ZBB is going to be in the long tail. So again, we expect to have the balance of the savings happen during 2016, but appearing in the full P&L in 2017. We do not break out the phasing of the savings.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, I'm just trying to understand a little bit more if you've got like $40 billion of goodwill on your balance sheet, is it a function of how the merger was accounted for that there isn't much more non-cash goodwill expense running through the P&L? Because Kraft and Heinz both had big foodservice businesses, and I would have assumed that those would have triggered more non-cash amortization expense. And I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Hi, Eric. It's Chris. I think once you get the 10-K, I think it'll be a little bit clearer because what you had was most of that goodwill going to indefinite-lived assets, a lot in terms of mark-up of brand values because within the transaction it was Kraft being acquired, so that's where most of the goodwill would have been assigned and largely to indefinite-lived assets. But I can follow up with you in a little bit more detail after the call.","Eric Richard Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good evening. Bernardo, you know from having your time in the fast food world that companies there will often open market test a new product launch so the companies and the franchisees will understand how a Big Bet will work before the Big Bet is made and the dollars spent. I'm reflecting on that because I feel like packaged food companies often have a sketchy track record on Big Bet innovation; they kind of give it a try. When you think about the bets you're making this year, how comfortable are you that the incrementality and the returns will be there? And any color why would be helpful. Thanks.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","David, thanks for the question. It's quite interesting. In a sense, what we've tried to do with the Big Bets not only here in the United States but Canada, Europe and all, we're going to fewer bets, but really bolder and stronger in that sense. So, in order to get there and mitigate the risk, we need really to pass the profile in the pipeline from consumer insight up to the shelf as a program in a much more effective way, and what you have been seeing from the experience in 2016, George mentioned some of them and so on, that really has been paying out. Look at the performance of Heinz Yellow Mustard, you look at P3 and look at hot sauces in Europe, and there are others coming to market in 2016. What's fair to say to your question that we're going to need to be much more robust on the testing, design, understanding consumers and really coming big in supporting to make it a win in the marketplace.","If you say that's a more risky strategy that in a fragmented innovation pipeline, you're probably right. In other hand, I think if you do all the steps prior to the launch, as testing, consumer insight and well-designed innovation pipeline, a robust innovation pipeline, I think can be quite significant but you really can move the needle in the company from a stable standpoint, and that's what we're looking for here.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good afternoon.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Could you talk a little bit about your marketing spending? And the 75% working spend that you're targeting, does that imply a net increase in marketing or can you actually get costs still down overall? And then just a little bit related to that, can you talk a little bit about the Kraft Kitchens database? Are you able to take advantage of that as well given that you have that proprietary property?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Michael, this is George. Thank you for your question. The first one about the marketing spend, we look at marketing in two buckets if you want: one is non-working media and one is working media. The non-working media are things such as production costs, advertising agency costs and that sort of things. And working media is actually what we pay for the ads to be aired or put on digital carrier or in print and so forth. That part of marketing will be growing by about $50 million this year versus prior year in the United States. The other part we are getting efficiencies from the scale that we have and that would give us the savings. So these are the two different parts. The second question...","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","(38:34).","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sorry, go ahead.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And in total it's net savings, though, you're saying? So the savings more than offset the working increase?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. In total would be a net savings and will continue to be in the mid-single digits. So that's our advertising spend. The second part of your question on Kraft Kitchens; as you know, this is the largest website for downloading recipes, not just in the United States but in the world, and absolutely we're already in motion to include all the Heinz products. And we're doing more on that in terms of digital database that we capture from visitors to this site that we can start forming a primary database to use for our own marketing directly to the consumers.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good evening. I just had a question for you if I could, a bit of a follow-on to an earlier question in relation to the input cost inflation you see in 2016. I'm not sure if you can quantify that, but maybe could you just give an idea of the degree of pricing that will be required to offset that inflation. And do you expect PNOC globally to be a drag on the gross margin this year given that you're starting to take pricing up?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Chris. We give no guidance in terms of commodity inflation.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, can you talk at all about PNOC then in relation to the increase you have to take in some of the global markets, you mentioned there being some FX-induced cost inflation?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Okay. This is George here. Let me take the PNOC as a follow-up from what I talked about earlier. We had a very good year from PNOC and the question was asked before about that and we believe this is sustainable. And the reason we believe it's sustainable because of the investments in our brand, the investments in innovation and the investments in renovation that we are making to be able to command premium to the product. So that will continue in the current year as well. And as you know, U.S. is the majority of the revenue of the worldwide market, so you'd expect a positive in this regard.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","I don't know if I could (41:17) I don't know if you asked about the FX, the inflation impact that we are seeing going forward, but we still think that we're going to face a similar type of headwind in FX in the next two quarters. We had around 6.5% headwind in the last quarter. 1\/3 of this is coming from the Venezuelan devaluation we did at the end of second Q, and we expect to face the same type of impact at least during the first half of 2016.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that additional color.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Okay. Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Bernardo or George, I think a lot of people have tried to pin you down on sales trends and what to expect in 2016 and I know that you don't want to give us specific sales guidance. But this is a metric that you care about a lot in your executive comp. We have to try to figure out on our end how to think about sales, at least the pace of recovery. Can you give us any help, though, at all on, should the first half of 2016 look kind of similar to the back half of 2015? Is it going to be negative for a while and then progressively get back to flat? We just want to try to help your investors not be surprised if sales are going to be negative for an extended period.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Rob. This is George. Maintaining stable top line for 2016 is our priority. So this is where we're looking at in the full year and to do that we are ensuring that business stability as we go through the footprint, the launch of new product development successfully, realizing the benefits we promised. And as I said earlier when we were talking about the Q4, that, that separation between consumption and shipment is going to (43:36) significantly as we move forward, and our performance will be more so what we are selling. So we see an improvement in 2016. We don't give guidance about the top line but we are confident about maintaining a stable top line moving forward.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you for the question. I'd like to ask about your trade promotion efficiencies and your adjustments there. As you dig into that with your retailers, can you maybe summarize the tone of those conversations in terms of where you've encountered any sticking points, where there's been more pushback? And then any particular areas where both parties are seeing mutually beneficial opportunities, just maybe how those conversations are progressing?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, John. I'm going to give you some color about what we do with trade promotion. What I won't be giving you is what we talk with the retailers about. I mean, this is something we do with our trade partners; we do not share publicly with the world. As far as trade promotions are going, we continuously evaluate all trade promotions based on the history and based what we did in return on investment. And like everyone else what we were trying, some promotions have a positive return on investments; other promotions have a negative returns on investment. So what we will try to do, we try to replicate more of the positive return on investment and take out and minimize the negative return on investment one.","Of course, there is a negotiating effort that goes on with retailers. We always try to work in a mutually beneficial way to ensure we are growing the category and providing value to consumers, and that's what is important to both the retailers and ourselves.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is that process proving to be a bit more volatile than you would have thought? Or is it more kind of a glide path, straight line adjustment that you're seeing?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","I've been doing this for 24 years, and it's the same anywhere in the world. I operate in a number of markets and this is like sport, contact sport anywhere in the world, so we do not, and it differs by category by category; differs by retailer, by geography, by personality, but that's what we get paid to do; that's our job and we believe we do it very well.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, George.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, folks. I want to pick up on that line of questioning around TBO or Trade Budget Optimization. First, can you comment about Europe a little bit more? You mentioned competitors maybe getting a little bit more aggressive and you haven't needed to respond. The way it sounded was actually potentially putting more trade money back in. Is that true?","And secondly, what are the learnings that you have from the initiatives you deployed at Heinz on this front that you're applying to Kraft? Sort of what made you do differently based on that learning?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Jason, here is Bernardo. Let me comment on the European part of your question then we'll go to the lessons. I think when you see the fourth quarter, it's true we experienced a little more challenged environment in the market in Europe, and that's pretty much a push by really the soup segment in U.K. What we went through to really a lower level promotion and we experienced some problem in the distribution with some of our retail partners in U.K. and the fact that the infant category in Italy where you have a stable and growing market share but continued to decline at a fast pace.","When you think about reacting to that and we're already seeing that reaction, it's not really only infusing more trade, that's your question, but actually getting the right level promotion with the positive returns and being with the right mechanism of trade was something George just mentioned in the question before, so we can have a win-win situation with our partners in U.K. and Europe.","And I think there is a solid plan in place to really push Italy to a different level in 2016. So it's true that we experience more challenge than we faced in the fourth quarter in Europe, especially the U.K. situation I mentioned. It's also true that you continue to grow market share in that market except for soup, all right? So what we may see now in first quarter and especially moving forward from here is the fact that we're investing more but we're investing the right instruments with positive return.","On the second part of your question about the lessons from Heinz and so, like I said before I think a lot of the agendas in Heinz that we push innovation, and go-to-market capabilities, higher media spend and so on, it took us almost a year when we started to push this agenda. And I think now given the \u2013 some knowledge we had before, the integration going well and a lot of other elements of the Kraft Heinz merger make us push this agenda in a faster pace. And there are some lessons from instruments (49:36) initiatives and other things on the SKU rationalization and footprint initiatives. And so that we learned the lessons to be applied here. I'm sure we're going to learn other lessons in this merger that will be applied some point in time, but that being said I believe we're doing things different in some cases and we're repeating also things that we believe have done well in the past.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. That's helpful. One quick more question, then I'll pass it on. When you made the acquisition, you guys highlighted the opportunity for Kraft brands abroad and the ability to use the Heinz infrastructure. Can you update us on where you stand with actually acting against that opportunity?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. We continue to be quite optimistic about that. We always knew that 2016 would be the year to build the supply chain and infrastructure. What we did, I think was the right move. To select 10 countries in 4 segments that really want to push the agenda while trying to do everything at the same time everywhere, that wouldn't be effective. And now we should come to market already looking second half 2016 already with some of these initiatives. But we're definitely building the infrastructure and the supply chain to take advantage of our distribution and footprint internationally to land the Kraft brands in different markets around the world. So we're probably going to talk more about that as the quarters progress.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good stuff. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Good evening, Alexia.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can I hone in on Europe here? The legacy Heinz business in Europe, the margins have been up at 37%, 38% on an EBITDA basis for the last couple of quarters. I think that's up from low-20%-s at the start of all this. Am I right in thinking that a lot of that recent step-up that we saw this quarter and last quarter is reductions in promotion spending? That's I think what was the gist of the comments and that, that wouldn't be included in the $1.5 billion of cost saving within the P&L?","And then the follow-up question is why couldn't margins in North America go to a similar level since we usually see margins higher in North America than in the European region? Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Alexia. This is Paulo, and thanks for the question. I think in Europe, we have a very strong implementation, not only of the revenue management side and the SKU rationalization, as you comment, but also a very strong ZBB and also the footprint that we did there went really well. All of this helped to improve the margins of the country. Besides that, when you compare \u2013 so again the promotions activity \u2013 now the selection of the right promotions also helped with the margin increase there.","When you compare Europe with other countries, I think each country and the footprint of categories that we have, the geographies and the brands that we have in different countries that does not allow us to kind of try to infer the same type of opportunity margin that we saw in Europe and other places. I think in Europe today we are in a stage that if we're going to get much more from sales growth than from margin increase in EBITDA.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Great. If we could take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks a lot and thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Can you talk about volume growth and the effect that it has on margins? Because I think from most of the companies that we talk to within the peer set, they always talk about wanting to see volumes up 1%, 2% or 3%, because of the incremental margins that they gain from the volume growth leverage through their manufacturing facilities.","But with your fourth quarter and your full year volumes down heavily, yet your margins are up, is this a story of there's just so much unprofitable volume that you can eliminate first before we worry about volume declines negatively impacting margins? So there's a lot of room there for some discussion. Please do what you can to help us understand. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, David, this is George. Thank you very much for your question. Our focus is on profitable growth. We repeated that a number of times, and we will have some categories where you'll see volume growth. And while we have other categories where you'll see a volume decline, overall, because of our size and the diverse businesses and categories we operate in, we will probably reflect what would go on in the marketplace.","The focus on growing volume for us would be largely done through the following: one is renovating our product range. You have seen a lot of activity in this area in making, reformulating products to reflect the consumer trend. The second one, we are innovating and we are accelerating the rate of innovation both in center stores to bring back the traffic to that part of the stores and in the perimeter where we have two large businesses, the Cheese & Dairy and the Refrigerated Meats businesses, and now that the foodservice business have a very strong white space program, what I mean by that white space program is when we merged the two foodservices business units, we saw that our legacy businesses were not overlapping a lot, were actually complementary to each other. That presented us with a potential revenue synergy that we refer to as the white space. And we have a strong program for 2016 to do that.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Final follow-up for me is just, is there an Easter shift effect in the first quarter of 2016 that you could call out for us?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. So you know for those of us who've lived through a number of Easters, we know that period of time really well. Last year's Easter was not too far removed from Q1; as you remember it was early in April where most of the orders of last year's Easter went into Q1. However, if we see a one-day shift in ordering between one year and another year, that could be the difference that would be helpful to us this year. So it won't be a high magnitude, but it'll be a little bit helpful for us in Q1 compared to last year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our third quarter and nine months results as well as our view on the path forward from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, Paulo Basilio, President of our U.S. Zone, will join the rest of us for the Q&A session.","Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Three months ago, we said that we expected organic growth from Q3 onwards, driven by a stronger more incremental marketing and innovation pipeline, leveraging investments in category management and go-to-market capabilities and supported by incremental merchandising spend and best-in-class customer service.","Today, we believe and are confident our Q3 results show that the turnaround of our top line performance is firmly underway, not just in terms of headline organic growth, but also real volume growth.","The transitory factors that negatively impacted first half sales are fading as expected and we saw further improvement in consumption trends in most countries, in most key categories. In fact on a global basis, more than half of our categories saw consumption growth in Q3.","In our categories in United States, are going to a trend bend, with aggregate consumption across our categories, improving nearly 2 percentage points in Q3 versus Q2. Excluding planters club entity, they are flipping from negative to positive.","Our market shares are also improving. Across the total company, Kraft Heinz is holding or growing share in more than half of our categories, including very strong market share gains in our Rest of World markets.","And finally, we continue to see solid performance in non-measured channels, including e-commerce and global foodservice. Breakthrough innovation and strong in-store activity, distribution gains and whitespace expansion are coming together.","Overall, while we did provide solid end market support for these activities and pricing in Q3 was down versus the prior year, it's important to note that our commercial growth is positive.","Commercial profitability or the profit contribution from price, volume and mix is positive and growing. Execution is improving, and our pipeline is getting stronger, both in terms of innovation and go-to-market initiatives.","At the same time, third quarter profitability was held back by several one-off factors, including commercial investments, the unfavorable impacts of bonus accrual versus 2017 and supply chain inflation as we expected, but also, by our decision to prioritize customer service as you saw volumes ramp-up and for goals, some degree of profitability in the short term.","In the end, we are confident pushing commercial growth higher, given the greater visibility we have on both retailer support and consumer interest in our programming as well as below-the-line for favorability from both tax and lower-than-expected interest expenses that we see coming through.","And as David will discuss, we are equally confident that profitability will improve going forward, as one-off negative factors from Q3 fall away. But before I hand it over to David, I think it's important to recognize that the commercial growth you're now seeing, and I believe that are in the path to sustainable, profitable growth, and driven by the fact that we are adapting the company with speed. And doing these two investments in both, our people and in-house capabilities.","On the slide 3, we show this fixed goals from the post integration framework, we introduced early this year. During the third quarter, we continued to make good progress in each one of those areas. More important, the different investments and in-house capability we have built are now coming together for measurable, sustainable gains and making our brands more relevant than ever.","For instance, look at our efforts in data driven marketing and brand building and innovation, we can see in United States that our ratio of quality impression to total impression is at 75%, significantly outpacing the industry average, (6:52) impression, I expect it to be up 9% in 2018 versus the prior year.","And year-to-date, we have had $14.5 billion PR impressions versus $13.5 billion of all of 2017, all good numbers, but more powerful when you consider how these two areas come together to drive incremental gains.","For instance, again in the United States, our PR campaigns to generate awareness for the launch of Heinz Mayo, not only lead to strong share gains in Mayo, but gave birth to a new product, Heinz Mayochup, which just landed of the shelves of American retailers and we will be going to the UK next.","This summer, Country Time rally people to save lemonade stands contributing to the strong gains we're seeing in our beverage mix business. And now our renovate all natural Capri Sun line up is taking ongoing in-school cafeterias through the #SitTogether pledge.","The data driven insights and in-house capability that drive these results are scalable and sharable across all categories and geographies. I mentioned on last call that you felt, that you had the strongest pipeline of activities in place. In our short history at Kraft Heinz and the numbers are starting to prove it.","In a similar fashion, our efforts to reinvent category management by deploying tools like revenue management, assortment management and planograms are supporting and informing everything we do, as we expand go-to-market capabilities around the world. For instance, we have more than doubled our in-store head count in United States, now fully trained Kraft Heinz employees armed with insights from our category management tools are helping to drive faster product velocity.","In areas, where we have greater in-store coverage we are seeing better performance in our key power windows, lower rates of out-of-stock merchandising and brand activation to display and shelving initiatives. This will help us push our total dollar velocities ahead of category average. And in both meals and sauces, our combination of powerhouse brands and optimize category management activities is driving dollar velocities 40% and 28% above their respective category average.","And we have been able to push strong incremental gains with innovation like Just Crack an Egg, which in the third quarter had velocities that outperformed its entire category. The old (10:07) United States retail in foodservice, you are seeing the benefits from assortment management, as we look to expand distribution and drive incremental gains in each region of the world, while reducing complexity in our supply chain.","And in the digital space, our year-to-date e-commerce sales in United States are up roughly 80%. We are capturing our fair share. And in many focused categories like snacks, nuts and condiments, we're significantly ahead of our fair share.","That being said, we still see a long runway for global growth. The ability to further leverage our data-driven insight and category management knowledge and we're investing aggressively in the next generation of capabilities.","These initiatives include deploying the next-generation of our Kraft recipes website, a cornerstone of our relationship marketing effort; building easy-to-use mobile technologies that learns about you and your family; recommends meal plans; and seamlessly connects you to grocers; and establishing a venture capital fund that can invest up to $100 million in emerging tech companies to further strengthen our business model.","From a capability building perspective, these initiatives can improve our ability to engage consumers in an environment characterized by expanding retail channels and fast-changing shopping patterns.","Finally, what make all of this come together is our effort to build best-in-class operations, as well as recruit, develop and align our people. In operations, we continue to deliver against industry-leading targets, we set for ourselves in quality, safety and customer service in all geographies where we operate.","Cost is one area we are falling short this year. This is due to a combination of greater than expected cost inflation in United States, our desire to invest and protect customer service as we ramp-up volumes as well as (12:43) to delay some savings projects to avoid operational disruption.","That said, we believe we have the right people, the right training and the right level of engagement to execute with excellency in all areas going forward. Specifically, our employees' recruiting remain strong with more than 85 candidates for each spot in our United States trainee and MBA program, and more than 400 candidates per spot internationally.","And our vertical promotion ratios are up versus prior year showing meritocracy in action. To summarize, we feel good about our commercial performance, sales and profitability and our ability to sustain this positive momentum. We continue to build and deploy new capabilities and adapt with speed. And while we have seen and accepted more volatility in EBITDA in the near-term, we believe our investments will allow our brand to be there in a bigger way tomorrow.","I will now hand it over to David to provide more color in our results and our path forward.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Bernardo and hello everyone. Turning to our results on slide 4. Total company organic net sales were up 2.6% in Q3, bringing year-to-date organic growth into positive territory. This was driven by 3.5 percentage points of volume\/mix growth in Q3 and bringing volume\/mix to essentially flat through the first nine months. Encouragingly, this performance was driven by volume\/mix growth in every reporting segment and led by consumption growth in a majority of U.S. categories.","Pricing was down 90 basis points in Q3, driven by increased promotional activity and key commodity-related pricing in the United States that more than offset higher pricing, mainly to offset local inflation and Rest of World markets.","By segment, the U.S. had a strong volume\/mix led quarter, characterized by consumption-led growth across the majority of categories. As expected, the change from positive first half pricing in the U.S. to lower pricing in Q3 was primarily driven by combination of three factors. One, lacking carryover pricing from last year; two, increase in-store activity to support our commercial pipeline, including higher year-over-year support in natural cheese and ready-to-drink beverages; and three, passing-through recent declines in some key commodities during the quarter, mainly bacon.","In Canada, while we saw solid growth in Coffee and Mac & Cheese, sales were down as anticipated from a combination of select product discontinuations, higher promotional expenses in the current year as well as comparisons with prior year limited time condiments offers and activities that were not repeated. As we mentioned on our last call, however, we do expect a solid pipeline of activities to return Canada to growth in Q4.","EMEA stayed in positive growth territory in Q3 as strong growth in Southern Europe and Germany, where we continue to grow the Kraft brands more than offset some one-off headwinds in Middle East. And in Russia, where we ran into destocking activity related to World Cup-related promotional products.","That said, we expect EMEA to improve sequentially in Q4 as the headwinds in Middle East and Russia fall away. And in Rest of World, in addition to the strong contribution from pricing, we've seen all year, Latin America drove strong organic volume\/mix gains from a combination of pasta sauce and condiments growth in Brazil as well as whitespace expansion across the region. And this more than offset lower shipments of canned seafood and cordials in Indonesia.","Moving to EBITDA. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was in fact lower than expectations we had outlined in our previous earnings call, resulting in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA now being down 7.2% on a constant currency basis. We certainly benefited from organic net sales growth. And in fact, our commercial profitability with the profit contribution from volume\/mix and pricing combined, was positive. Despite all the stepped up merchandising activity we carried out during the quarter. However, several factors that we do not expect to repeat negatively impacted both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of profitability in Q3.","As expected and as we outlined in our previous call, year-on-year EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by a combination of the commercial investment programs we've talked about all year, the swing from overhead favorability last year to a more normal bonus incentive compensation accrual this year, and the non-key commodity inflation we've previously noted.","In addition to that, our absolute level of profitability in Q3, was negatively impacted by three factors. The first was higher than expected one-off operating costs in the U.S. from our decision to prioritize customer service, delays some saving projects to avoid disruption and buy more spot market freight during the quarter than we otherwise would, in a normal course of business. Second, was the disproportionate impact from commercial investments, particularly marketing, as we stepped up our investment levels in the second half of the year. And third, were some unanticipated one-off supply chain costs mainly in the Middle East.","Looking forward, we expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of EBITDA margin to improve beginning in Q4. Specifically, we expect to sustain our organic top line momentum, the one-off factors that drag Q3 EBITDA down should fall away. And on top of that, we expect to see a better year-on-year balance between cost inflation and savings.","Finally, at adjusted EPS, we were down $0.05 versus Q3 last year as lower taxes on adjusted earnings in the current period mitigated part of the adjusted EBITDA decline.","I would also add here that for the full-year in 2018, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 20% versus 21% previously. And incremental interest expense in 2018 should be roughly $70 million versus the $80 million, we previously outlined.","Which leads to our outlook on slide 5. I'll start by reiterating what we said before that we believe the pipeline and capabilities are now in place for us to push a more aggressive growth agenda from innovation that drives incremental consumption, to distribution gains across channels and expanding our brands into geographic and category whitespace.","We continue to believe we're in a strong position to deliver organic growth for the full-year and sustain that momentum into 2019. We also expect a much better balance of top and bottom line growth going forward.","2018 has clearly been a year where results have been more or less dominated by a number of transitory issues, on both the sales and cost sides of the equation, that we do not expect to repeat.","At the same time, we've essentially accelerated what would have been three years of commercial investments into 2018, push commercial grow even harder than originally planned, given greater visibility over the likely success of our pipeline. And this was largely offset by tax savings.","Going forward, we feel good about our ability to continue driving commercial growth and our ability to drive EBITDA dollar growth and industry-leading margins as one-off factors fall away and the contribution from our savings initiatives accelerate.","To-close, I think it's worth repeating the thoughts that we've expressed all year, that we're developing capabilities to create brand and category advantage and achieve profitable growth that we're investing aggressively now in order to see benefits sooner, and that these are the key factors shaping our near-term results into 2018 and we believe will drive sustainable profitable growth into 2019 and beyond.","We think our focus on EBITDA dollars and our returned based discipline in sales, marketing and innovation will lead us well positioned to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins.","We have good visibility on considerably better post-integration cash flow. We have and will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and credit standing through both de-risking and other activities such as divestitures of non-core assets when consistent with our strategic framework as we recently announced.","And our ability to continue building brand and category advantage through differentiated capabilities will not only be a key enabler, but will make two plus two equal more than four in the event of a transformational deal.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your question please.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you so much. Wondering if you can help us quantify the magnitude of what you would consider one-time or non-recurring cost in the P&L. There is a lot different costs, there is a lot of different things that drag down your EBITDA this quarter. I think some of them like marketing probably don't go away, some of them like maybe the customer service issues maybe do go away. I'm just trying to get a sense of that, because it's difficult to maybe model ahead unless we have a better understanding of sort of what just happened.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken, this is David. Thanks for the question. So, as I break this down for you, I think the first thing to reiterate here is commercial profitability for Q3 or the profit contribution from vol\/mix and pricing combined was positive, okay? Which is good considering all the growth initiatives and stepped up merchandising activity that we had in the quarter. So, we're very happy with that.","Beyond that, there are really four main drivers of the year-over-year decline, many of which were one-off in nature. So first, we have the stepped up commercial investments that we previously outlined, with Q3, seeing the heaviest quarterly impact within the year.","Second, you have the swing from overhead favorability we mentioned last year to more normal incentive compensation accrual this year, so that is one-off in nature.","Third, we had additional cost inflation that we previously noted, however the impact was worse in Q3 from our decision to prioritize customer service, as our volumes ramped up through the quarter, which in turn led us to delay certain supply chain savings projects and also by more spot markets freight than we otherwise would have.","So, a lot of those factors were in fact kind of one-off in nature for the quarter. On top of that, we had some unanticipated one-off supply chain costs that were mainly related to the transition of the Middle East business to our European business.","All that to say, we're not going to provide precise numbers around it but we expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of profitability to improve significantly beginning in Q4 and into next year versus what we saw this year and in the first half.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you \u2013 as a follow-up, just the prioritizing of customer service is a headwind, can you just walk us through what that means in practical terms? I'm not quite sure I understand in this case.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah, sure, Ken. This is David, again. So I'd say some of the savings projects that we anticipated for this year were very much variable cost in nature, so things like yield and variable labor. So \u2013 and this is versus fixed cost that we've captured over the last three or so years. So we decided to delay some of those productivity initiatives that we're executing across our factories. And this is really to ensure that there is no disruption as volumes ramped up in the quarter and ramped up more than, frankly, we had expected. On top of that, the additional volume that we didn't anticipate above and beyond what we planned for came at an additional cost and a lot of those costs are logistics or freight related.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your question, please.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Two questions from me. One is just a follow-up to Ken's question. I think on the last earnings call, the expectation was the EBITDA split for the year would be roughly 50-50, first half, second half. So given that we missed by, I don't know, about $100 million or so in the quarter. I guess the question is, is the split for the year now more like 49-51? Or is the split different? Just trying to get a sense for kind of where things stood relative to maybe where you're fourth quarter expectations were. And then I have a follow-up.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan, thanks for the question. This is David, again. So as we said in the last call, as you pointed out, and as we said today, we do expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of EBITDA margin to improve in the back half and further improve in Q4. And this is based on the sustained organic top-line momentum that we're seeing, the one-off factors that I talked about that drag EBITDA this quarter which will fall away next quarter, and a better year-on-year balance between cost inflation and savings.","Relative to your specific question that we talked for the last quarter, I think given the unexpected one-off factors in Q3 that we experienced, it may be difficult to get all the way back to the 50-50, first half, second half, (28:32) EBITDA that we targeted. But we should see a very good sequential improvement into Q4.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So order of magnitude, it's around that $100 million sort of miss in the quarter is sort of the one-off piece that you may or may not be able to close the gap on?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah, I think around that range would be appropriate.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just one other question in terms of asset sales. I guess the asset sale in India. is that sort of indicative of the larger sort of strategy of maybe potentially selling more assets down the road? Just some color or some context around that as well. Thanks.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan. Hees (29:17) Bernardo. Look, we \u2013 like we always said, we like our portfolio. I think each brand has its role in its specific country and region. But we do evaluate every business and brand on its own and see the returns and what we can do with that, right?","In the India case, I think it was very clear for us that we didn't have really the competitive advantage in the new market and the beverage portfolio we have in the country. It could not scale, right, for the level you wanted to. (29:55)","And the value we're receiving from the proceeds are really higher than we could have been doing with the business. Like you said, I think there are other things to be considered within the portfolio in general. And we always evaluate very careful on a case-by-case situation. I think an important side effect of this is really the fact that we \u2013 obviously, with the proceeds, we're able to strengthen our balance sheet, right, and give us more firepower, especially in a moment where industry evaluations are more attractive, right? And that I think is a positive in this case.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. So similar to the previous two, I wanted to dig into the $100 million EBITDA miss that we saw in the quarter. At what point did you realize that things were tracking below plan? How did you react to it? And can you walk us through what of that $100 million actually washes away in the fourth quarter? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure, Steve. This is David, again. Thanks for the question. So we said that we expected Q3 adjusted EBITDA dollars to be down a greater order of magnitude than what we saw in the first half. So that gets you to more than $140 million at the start. So kind of two big factors in the quarter that took us lower than what we had originally expected. Again, we had a higher than expected one-off operating cost in the U.S. against a prioritized customer service. We delayed some of those savings projects to avoid disruptions. And we bought more on the freight market, which increased our logistics costs than we otherwise would have given the additional volume. And then on top of that, the unanticipated one-off supply chain costs.","But again as I said, we expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of profitability to improve significantly into next quarter. But unfortunately, we're not going to provide any more specifics around the magnitude of that into Q4.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And given what you've seen right now, is there any reason to think that EBITDA dollar growth can't expand in calendar 2019? I know it's early to talk about 2019, but given the inconsistency of recent performance, I think, maybe investors deserve a little bit of clarity as to how confident you feel about the sustainability of what the trends you're seeing develop in the fourth quarter. And is the tax rate sustainable at 20%? Thank you.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure, Steve. David, again here. Thanks for the question. So for 2019, we do expect a much better balance of top- and bottom-line growth going forward. In 2018, we've had a number of transitory issues that we don't expect to repeat. We really accelerated and pushed commercial growth harder given the greater visibility on the investments that we're driving and putting in the business. And then on top of that, the tax favorability which mitigated a number of these headwinds on the bottom-line.","Going forward, we feel good about that balance for several reasons. Our ability to continue driving real volume\/mix driven organic growth; our ability to drive EBITDA dollars and at industry-leading margins as one-off factors fall away and the contributions from our savings curve accelerate.","And finally, I think our ability to build the brand and category advantages and capabilities that we've been talking about, the same thing will make two plus two greater than four in the event of a transformational deal.","And then finally, with respect to your tax rate, I think we started the year a bit higher but based on further clarity on new tax laws, I think, we're really expecting to get to that 20% for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I just want to focus on U.S. pricing. I understand that some of the decline was probably pass-through pricing, but I'm assuming you're still down ex that or at least not up substantially, which is surprising just given the level of gross margin pressure and EBITDA pressure we're seeing here at the corporate level. So just wanted to get your thoughts around what sort of drove the sequential deceleration in pricing?","Obviously, a lot of your direct and even more so indirect peers in CPG land have been talking about taking more pricing recently given some of the margin pressures in this sector. So do you have plans to increase pricing going forward? And as you look at your price premiums in the categories you compete, given they moved up over the last few years, do you think you need adjustments in those price premiums? Or are you comfortable you can get more pricing going forward? Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Dara. This is Paulo. Thanks for the question. So when we think about the price and the profile we have in the quarter, it was really consistent with our expectations. The change from the positive pricing we had in the first half to a lower net pricing in the third quarter was primarily driven by three factors. The first one was we start lapping (35:45) the carryover pricing we had from prior year. Second, we pass through recent commodity declines, mainly in bacon. And given our strong innovation pipeline and portfolio position, we believe that was the right time to expand trial, consumption, and drive strong volume gains which we didn't (36:05).","As David noted before, our commercial profitability or our profit contribution from pricing and vol\/mix was solid. We believe that we have a very strong portfolio of brands with ability to price as we have been showing over the past several quarters as we've mentioned. And for your last point, and you look forward to the next year, for sure, price will be an important lever we will consider in managing our cost profile.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the comment on 2019 EBITDA, I just want to be clear. You talked about a better balance. Did you mean year-over-year growth in EBITDA in 2019, just to be clear? Or are we talking about sort of level of improvement relative to 2018? I just want to be precise there. Thank you.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Dara. This is David, again. Thanks for the question. So, when we talk about our ability to drive EBITDA dollars, we do mean year-over-year.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your question, please.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Just two things from me. One quick one first. Sometimes when \u2013 I think when investors hear sort of the term spending to ensure customer service and things like that, I mean sometimes the notion comes up of, is it slotting or paying more to keep product on the shelf for retailers sort of asking for more dollars or those sorts of things. So, I was hoping you could just address that just to take that off the table if that's not the case.","And then I guess more importantly, putting the one-offs and the one-off spending aside, you still did it looks like or sounds like increased sort of commercial spending, spending around capabilities, spending that's ongoing that will be in the base, if you will.","And it sounded like after the second quarter that you had a pretty good read on that and obviously it increased in the third. So, really, I guess what gives you that comfort level that this is the right number and that in 2019 there's not, ultimately, the need for another significant step-up? Because we have seen some other food companies already starting to talk to 2019 and saying, hey, one year of reinvestment spending that was tax reform-led actually isn't enough to get the top-line going. It really needs to be a multi-year timeframe. So, any color on that would be really helpful, too. Thank you.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew, this is David. Thanks for the question. So, let me take your first question and then I'll take part of your second question and hand it to Bernardo. So in terms of the costs, additional costs that we incurred, that were one-off in nature to support the volume, these were not any sort of trade or slotting cost. These were twofold.","One kind of logistics, freight costs which were higher than what we anticipated given whenever we have more volume than what we planned for, you need to go to the spot market and specifically more expenses. Going forward, as we planned the higher volumes, you wouldn't expect to see those same level of cost.","The second piece was actually less about cost inflation and more about our savings projects, which we chose to delay. So, in short, it was not related to anything like freight or slotting fees.","In terms of the commercial spending, I think just one important caveat here. We did talk about the incremental investments this year. We did have some kind of one-off costs associated with the fact that as you release this into the P&L, it did come in higher in Q3 than what would be reflected on a run-rate basis. So there is kind of some lumpiness from the quarter-to-quarter perspective that drove EBITDA down that is one-off in nature. But that's on top of the investments that we talked about and anticipated this year. And then, I'll turn it to Bernardo to answer your last question.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. In respect of the level and thinking already about 2019, we do believe what's the right call in the beginning of 2018 to take the decision to go to the $300 million commercial investment given the benefit in the strong balance sheet we have with tax reform and so on. And this number is already in our base. So to be honest, looking to 2019, we do believe the investments we're doing now is not only for 2018, but there are significant benefits coming in the quarters to come in 2019 and beyond. I think the commercial results with the volume\/mix grow especially in the United States is a good testament (41:01) to that. So as we're seeing today, I think the numbers are already in our base. We are not seeing the reason to increase that into 2019.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just one question on pricing and promotion effectiveness, you've talked about and we've heard about your sales team making pitches for promotional changes out there with retailer customers using data to do that. It's not always easy to get retailers to change the promotions that they currently do. They feel like they know what they're going to get. And we see in these results it's tough to see the effectiveness really coming through. You talked about cheese and ready-to-drink promotions as drags on margins. So can you just speak to the traction you're getting? Maybe provide some examples or maybe some evidence of how you're getting smarter and convincing retailers to take this journey with you on promotion effectiveness? Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, David. This is Paulo. I think the main driver here to see this is the comments that we saw the commercial profitability that we saw in the quarter. So, we are really comfortable and happy with the efficiencies we got in the moment that we decided to do the investments we did. So, in the start of the promo discussion, I think we are \u2013 yeah, we've been investing in revenue management strategy. We've been getting (42:50), which type of promotion to execute. And an example, I think we were very successful in the beverage promotions that we did in ready-to-drink. And all this ended up appearing in our commercial profitability.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Good evening. Just had two questions for you, if I could. The first would just be, as we think in relation to the gross margin performance, you mentioned before David some comments about positive commercial profits. And but I was surprised with the weakness in the gross margin. So I want to make sure I understand some of those unique factors, how they would've affected gross margin versus, say, SG&A. I felt like some of those were could have gone either way. Do you have any color on that you can provide?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Chris. This is David. Thanks for the question. Yes, so, we did see both gross margin and SG&A increase into that way on EBITDA margin. Again, driven by the same factors that I talked about with the higher-than-expected supply chain cost in the U.S., okay? So more related to operations side.","Disproportionate impact from the commercial investments that we made, which is going to be on the SG&A line. And then unanticipated one-off supply chain costs from the Middle East that we moved to Europe. And that will be more of a gross profit, gross margin impact. But again, as many of these one-off factors fall away, we would expect to see the dollars and the profitability improve significantly in Q4 and going into next year. And that's going to be across both gross margin and SG&A.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you for that. And then just a question in relation to your U.S. sales, you had obviously very strong performance there, volume driven. I don't see that level of growth in the measured channels. But I wonder if you could say is there anything unique that's helping boost the U.S. sales in this quarter, being new products, that kind of thing? Or maybe also how your unmeasured channels performed in the quarter to help kind of round up that performance for the U.S.?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Chris, this is Paulo. Thanks for the question. We estimate that our underlying consumption growth in Q3 was roughly 1.3% across all retail channel splits and service. This excludes the Planters and club where we lapped shipment loss in July. The strong trends (45:22) we saw in first half was pretty much driven by frozen, snack nuts, beverage, meats and sauces businesses.","The other drivers in Q3, if you go for Q3, were a combination of inventory shift and timing of (45:38) prior year. Net-net, these other factors added roughly 50 basis points to authentic growth in Q3.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. Wanted to delve into this time you've been using commercial profitability. Can you just talk through like, what is included in that number and why is that a good measure of sort of the ongoing profitability of the business? That would be helpful, and I have a follow-up.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure. Akshay, this is David. Thanks for the question here. So, in terms of the commercial profitability, as we look at it, we define is as the contribution from pricing and vol mix, okay? So EBITDA together. And this is before things like investments and inflation on the business.","Now, the reason that we're calling it out is because we think it's important to understand that even with the lower negative pricing year-over-year, the significant volume pickup that we had that was significantly positive leading to organic growth, was positive on EBITDA and not negative.","That being said, we're still seeing inflation and we need to address the inflation in the business, which in the near term we're managing with our savings curve. And going forward we'll evaluate other levers like price.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Got it. So in other words, I mean when the market's seeing pricing down and profits down, they're assuming you've got the profit from taking pricing lower, right? And what you're trying to say is that's not what happened basically?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, Akshay. The key point here is that, profitability on a dollar perspective actually increased in despite negative pricing because our volume mix was so strong in the quarter, which we are very happy with.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Got it. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, sorry about that. Can you guys hear me?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Awesome. A little phone malfunction here on my end. I wanted to come back trying to sort of unpack the drivers of the decline from a slightly different angle. Looking at the EBITDA year-on-year decline in the U.S., it's been accelerating obviously at least another $100 million-plus of year-on-year erosion this quarter. It sounds like that's predominantly driven by these onetime factors, right, as well as maybe a little bit of bonus accrual?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Jason, this is David. Thanks for the question. That is correct. So the same factors that I outlined on a global basis are very much the drivers for the U.S. year-over-year and a big piece of that is going to be the bonus accrual that were lapping from prior year has an impact in our year-over-year growth. And then the other items were more related to our kind of current year margin profile, all of which together is why we feel confident that we'll see that sequential improvement into Q4.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And maybe you can help me size the bonus piece thing because if I look at $100 million, I hear you on marketing, geez, with the amount of marketing you spend in the U.S. an incremental $10 million will be a really high percent. So it's hard to see that incremental marketing is a material driver. And it's difficult to wrap our head around the logistic side being another $100 million or so that it would kind of had to be the bridge there. So maybe I'm not just fully appreciating the magnitude of this bonus accrual. Can you contextualize that for us with some real numbers?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Jason, this is David. So unfortunately we can't provide specific numbers on the bonus and some of these other drivers. But what I'd say is, the bonus is quite a large driver in the year-over-year delta as you can imagine the magnitude, the variable compensation that we have.","On top of that the operational costs are also quite significant in the quarter, both the logistics costs I talked about as well as the savings projects that we didn't anticipate in Q3, but we're ready to execute at the right moment. And then finally there was a supply chain cost that we talked about related to Middle East and Europe. So, I think there are a few different components. The two largest I guess I can go ahead and say are the bonus and the higher operational costs that we talked about.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I had to try. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you for the question. I thought that your shipments in the U.S. were shipping slightly above the consumption that we were measuring in Nielsen. Presumably, I think it's because you're getting more shelf space. But I tried to find that in Nielsen data and I couldn't really get it. Maybe it's on a lag. Can you speak a bit about the shelf space that you might have gained from all these new product introductions? Are you seeing it in your tracking data? And also are you taking steps to make sure that you're not causing an environment where maybe there could be an inventory de-load in fourth quarter, which has happened before but maybe not with all these new products? Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, this is Paulo. So, again if you think about the breakdown between the 1.8% growth, 1.3% is coming from what we're seeing is underlying real consumption in Q3. The other 50 bps is the volume effect of that I mentioned about combination of timing of to expand an inventory shift (51:47). So the real consumption we see for the business is 1.3%. And this is pretty much a combination of a management channel's growing around 0.8% and un-corporate channels, including foodservice growing another 50 bps.","So that is how we're seeing our consumption happen. So, we are very happy, confident with the consumption improvement. We are seeing this in Q3. We're also seeing this in Q4. So we're seeing our real, as I said, underlying consumption growth in Q3 in the level of 1.3%.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much and good evening. So just wanted to confirm, Paulo, I think you said that shipments in the quarter were ahead of the consumption including the unmeasured channels. Is that correct? And then will that reverse out in the fourth quarter?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","No. No. What I said now is that our underlying consumption overall is around 1.3% growth year-over-year. And this 1.3% is a combination of measured channels 0.8% growth plus 50 bps coming from other unmeasured channels including foodservice.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. A follow-up on the bonus question. So in most companies when we see companies miss profit targets, usually the bonus accruals are \u2013 they go the opposite way. There's not more bonuses. There is less bonuses. Why is it working that way here? I just don't understand something.","And then I just had a final question on market share. Can you give us some sense on your read on Kraft Heinz's market share movement across its major categories and major geographies? It's a big picture question. A lot of companies have some nice simple metrics to give us an understanding as to whether or not you're gaining or holding share in certain percentages of categories. I don't know if you guys can provide that, but it would be helpful. Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Rob. It's Bernardo. In regarding to metrics of compensation, and so as we have been discussing quite some time, we are very performance driven organization, right? In our case here, since the beginning of the year we have a combination of different KPIs between top-line growth that have been accelerating EBITDA and cash flow.","And we deem the strength, the variable compensation established by \u2013 with this in mind and looking at our balance sheet, our performance this year have been surpassing significant performance last year. Not in all KPIs, but in general. And that relate to our variable compensation. With that I want to ask David to take the KPI overall metric that you're requesting.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure. Thanks, Bernardo. I think a couple data points that I think Bernardo said earlier on the call. On a global basis, more than half of our categories are consumption growth in Q3, okay?","And the second point to point out, I think a particular relevance in the U.S. Our categories are going through a trend then with aggregate consumption across our categories improving nearly two percentage points in Q3 versus Q2, which obviously excludes the one-off impact of nuts that we've talked about.","But we've seen a sequential improvement both in measured channels, and as Paulo pointed, overall consumption. But on a global basis, more than half of our categories saw consumption growth in the quarter. Paulo, I don't know...","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","I can comment more about the U.S. What we can see is that in the first half we were losing and pretty much the same happened in 2017, we are losing around 0.6% share in our \u2013 across the portfolio.","In Q3, we reduced this to 0.3%. And if we exclude the nuts business that we are lapping shipments since July, this number would go around 0.1%. So it's a significant improvement in share performance that we see in \u2013 moving \u2013 when we move through the year.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","And Rob, just to complement on that, I think that what makes us actually positive about what's coming because you see consumption and share in most parts of the world really improving behind the commercial initiatives and the investments, right?","Where the results representing now and we believe they can be sustainable in the coming months and quarters, we'll continue to see acceleration in share, in volumes and in the commercial performance in general.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, everyone. I think we'll stop it there. For anybody with follow-up questions, Andy Larkin and myself will be available and anybody in the media with follow-up questions, Michael Mullen will be available.","So thanks very much for joining us. And have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.

My name is Katherine, and I'll be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Chris Jakubik","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our business update. We'll begin today's call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results as well as an update on our path forward from Miguel Patricio, our CEO; and Paulo Basilio, our CFO. And then we'll open the lines for your questions.","Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC.","We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release.","Now let's turn to Slide 3, and I'll hand it over to Miguel.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I think it's appropriate to start today's update by recognizing that 2019 was a very difficult year for Kraft Heinz, for our employees, our Board and our stakeholders. Yet, it has also been a period of new understanding and new change, and we are confident that our journey to a stronger, more agile Kraft Heinz has already begun. We are seeing the beginning of stabilization in our second half trend bend on EBITDA performance.","We believe the essential ingredients for our turnaround are now in place: people with deep experience in key roles to drive functional excellence; perspective on where consumers are going and how we can win; productivity initiatives with detailed jobs to be done; and a financial profile with strong free cash flow going forward.","Today's dividend declaration is confirmation of our Board's confidence in our turnaround plan and our ability to reposition Kraft Heinz for sustainable long-term growth and returns. We are clear on what we need to achieve in 2020 and have greater visibility on delivering a stronger foundation and rebuilding business momentum as we exit the year. We have also developed a better understanding of future consumers, a long-term vision for the company and the strategic plan that we are excited about, and we look forward to sharing with you in more detail in early May in New York.","I know many of you were expecting a March date versus a May date for the unveiling of our strategy, but with Carlos Abrams-Rivera coming in as our new Head of the U.S. zone, I wanted to make sure we have his full input as we detail our multiyear plans for the bottom up before we present it to you. For today, I would like to use our time to talk about the progress we made in the fourth quarter, what's working and what's not as well as the critical actions we've taken and the decisions we have made to reestablish visibility, control and long-term direction for the company.","I will do that in the context of the three work streams we talked about on our previous call: first, stabilizing the business as we executed the 2019 plan; second, setting our nearer-term transformation in motion; finally, establishing a true north through our enterprise strategy work. In our first work stream, delivering the 2019 plan, we closed the year with a much firmer handle on the business.","Numbers-wise, while organic net sales were down slightly more on a sequential basis, the key drivers were as we anticipated, with consumption, share trends and shipments in the United States, Canada and EMEA in line with our expectations. This also reflected strong necessary pricing mainly to offset recent commodity inflation. We were more disciplined by executing promotional programs with better returns than last year and shifting investments to flag shipments and emerging channels.","And perhaps most important of all, we began to show greater control over our costs. Specifically, Q4 net inflation in our U.S. supply chain was favorable, the first time the U.S. has achieved net cost reduction in two years. And these better-than-anticipated performance in the U.S. offset the worse-than-anticipated results in the rest of the world. As a result, we delivered a significant first half to second half trend bend in year-over-year EBITDA performance on a global basis, going from down 16% in first half to down only 3.6% in the second half, excluding divestitures.","And in the U.S., back to flat in the second half after being down 14.9% in the first half. But more important than the trend bending EBITDA was the improved visibility we now have over the main drivers of our business. As I said when I started, I will be transparent with you about what's going well and what needs improvement.","Slide 7 is that candid self-assessment on one page. Knowing you have problems is the first step. Moving the items on the right to the left will be our work in 2020. In a nutshell, we maintained momentum in the areas we expected. We had fewer surprises in the areas we need to improve. But across all those shortfalls, we understand root causes and are clear on what needs to change.","For instance, on sales, we are confident we are working from a solid base. Retail takeaway on categories we play in both the U.S. and Canada remains solid. Our U.S. pricing activities during the second half came through as expected. Philadelphia refrigerated beverages and e-commerce posted strong growth and beat their plans.","International Foodservice continued to grow middle single-digits. And our condiments and sauces in Latin America, the UK and Asia remained strong. At the same time, cold cuts, natural cheese and coffee lost share in the U.S. for reasons we expected. We also continue to see retailer inventory reductions and some distribution losses in the second half of the year, but our planning and forecasting was more accurate. And while we know we need to improve customer satisfaction and resolve service issues in our U.S. nuts and Foodservice business, we understand what needs to be done and are taking action to improve in areas, like customer planning and in-store execution.","In terms of operations and costs, as I mentioned, supply chain costs in the U.S. stabilized in the second half, while we continue to operate at the industry-leading quality and safety levels. At the same time, we have much work still to do, but a clear path forward to improve total company gross profit, EBITDA in Canada and our rest of the world markets, starting with better management of supply chain costs in those markets.","Finally, and most importantly, on the people side, our turnover remained higher than we would have liked in 2019. But now we have the leadership and plans in place to build and retain top talent going forward. I also wanted to say that I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication from our people in 2019.","Since the outset, my number one focus has been on our people and developing the team. On our last call, I highlighted how we were redeploying some of our top talent to improve our effectiveness and restructuring the team to accelerate our progress through the establishment of a Chief Growth Officer role and the new consolidated international zone.","My team is now filled out, and it's the experienced, diverse team I was hoping to build. We have a great mix of well-qualified incumbents in key function roles, top internal talent in positions where they can make the greatest contribution for our company, and new but experienced professionals in areas where we need fresh perspectives the most.","I'm also encouraged by significant progress in building our bench strength and the number of experienced professionals that we have \u2013 that have joined Kraft Heinz to be a part of our turnaround. This includes industry veterans and former Kraft Foods executives, like Carlos Abrams-Rivera as our new Head of the U.S. business.","But it also includes experienced leaders in supply chain and finance that I have personally known and worked with during my career as well as leaders in areas such strategy, R&D and revenue management with deep consumer-related experience at leading companies in our industry. These professionals are bringing with them, on average, more than 20 years of experience collectively. I have no doubt that we can truly transform Kraft Heinz in the coming years.","In fact, we have already been making rapid progress on the transformation front that will both benefit 2020 and strengthen our momentum as we head into 2021. Slide 10 shows the list of projects we outlined on a previous call. In critical areas like sales execution, we have completed deep dives in each function and defined step-by-step jobs to be done to improve customer planning and satisfaction as well as drive competitive differentiation for our brands.","In operations, we have multiple best practice manufacturing and procurement initiatives underway led by deeply experienced subject matter experts in critical areas that we are confident we'll close on productivity gaps versus benchmarks and deliver net savings over a multiyear period. And we look forward to sharing those details with you as we unveil our new strategy.","For today, I would like to focus on three projects because of their relevance to the outlook for the 2020 that Paulo will discuss later. It's our people, innovation and marketing. On our people initiatives, we've taken the time to reflect and reassess the root causes of performance shortfalls, employee satisfaction and, ultimately, turnover with causes ranging from lack of strategic direction, to training, to roles and accountabilities.","And these informed changes we are now implementing on several fronts, such as making improvements in employee engagement and turnover, a KPI for every member of our leadership team, making total company KPIs more weighted to profitable growth and setting targets that are better aligned cross functionally, so we can work as one company pushing in the same direction and have a better chance of achieving our objectives and our people realizing their full potential compensation.","So we are going in 2020 with full incentive compensation payouts baked into our outlook that Paulo will discuss in a moment. Around our innovation efforts, I mentioned on our previous call our intention to shift support and emphasis to fewer, bigger, bolder initiatives. Our 2020 plans now call for 50% fewer projects, a significant shift from land extensions to expansionary launches, mainly behind existing brands and just as much sales generated from more concentrated efforts.","There are two reasons I'm highlighting this. First, because this is an important first step as we better align our post-2020 pipeline with our enterprise strategy. And second, because it's a key driver of our marketing efficiencies we expect this year. In marketing, we have defined optimal media spend by portfolio role. And in 2020, we will be redirecting dollars disproportionately towards support of our flagship brands.","We are also finding efficiencies in nonworking marketing, such as fewer research dollars necessary for the more concentrated innovation pipeline I just mentioned as well as cutting the number of agencies we employ in half. As a result, we plan to increase working media, what consumers actually see, by 30% in 2020 with even greater increases behind the brands that are the biggest drivers of our profitability.","Finally, regarding the longer term, a quick update on the development of our enterprise strategy and our promise to share it in detail with you early this year. Progress on this front has been both excellent and exciting, especially for our marketers. We are reimagining a new Kraft Heinz that is closer to consumers and the child in our response to market dynamics. We've assessed the changing food landscape, developed a proprietary view of the future consumers and build top-down priorities and plans.","With our full team in place, we are now detailing our bottoms-up initiatives by category, by brand to finalize what we believe will return Kraft Heinz to growth and best-in-class performance with discipline in knowing where to invest, how to win and how to prioritize investments across the portfolio. While Paulo will provide the detailed drivers in a moment, my team and I have done the work for 2020, a plan that we own, a plan that we are confident we can deliver that is driven by initiatives already identified and fully resourced.","2020 will be the first full year of what we expect will be a three-stage turnaround, a turnaround characterized by laying the foundation for the future growth, fueling our flagship brands and accelerating growth platforms and then hitting our stride on both the top and bottom lines. And during our May investor meeting, our Kraft Heinz team will describe what we are doing to strengthen our foundation and drive a new chapter for our company.","With that, I will turn over to Paulo to discuss where we are and where we expect to go from here on the financial front.","Paulo Basilio","Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the fourth quarter, our performance showed several promising early signs of stabilization. Q4 organic net sales were down 2.2% with strong positive pricing of two percentage points, more than offset by lower volume and mix versus the prior year. Pricing was positive in all reporting segments, except Canada, but the U.S. was the main contributor with a 3.1% gain versus the prior year. This was driven by several factors, including higher lease pricing announcing early this year, key commodity pass-through pricing in cheese and meats, favorable trade timing and lower promotional intensity versus the fourth quarter of 2018.","Total company volume\/mix declined 4.2 percentage points primarily driven by the higher U.S. pricing and to a lesser extent, lower shipments in the rest of the world markets. And these impacts more than offset volume growth in Canada and EMEA. With respect to profitability, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was down 5.3% versus last year, with divestitures accounting for 150 basis points of the decline.","Excluding divestitures and currency, we saw growth in the U.S. and EMEA, as both zones benefited from improved cost visibility and supply chain cost controls. However, these gains were more than offset by a significant decline in our rest of the world segment as well as higher general corporate expenses and lower pricing in Canada. I would note here, however, that roughly three quarters of the constant currency EBITDA decline in the rest of the world segment was due to roughly $35 million of costs that we do not expect to repeat.","This was from a combination of higher labor-related expenses from the impact of the Holidays Act in New Zealand as well as asset and inventory related write-offs in Australia, New Zealand and Latin America. The remainder of the rest of the world EBITDA was driven by ongoing supply chain cost inflation and lower volume\/mix.","In fact, our supply chain costs on a global basis still held us back year-on-year in Q4. This was driven by supply chain inflation in rest of the world markets and a combination of lower pricing and higher input costs that led to a weak performance versus the prior year in Canada. Both of these need to be fixed in 2020, and we have specific plans in place to improve performance.","However, we do expect that each will remain negative in our first quarter. At adjusted EPS, the decline we saw versus prior year reflected lower adjusted EBITDA, a higher effective tax rate and a higher stock-based compensation versus the prior year period that we highlighted on our previous call. Finally, I would like to mention our strong cash flow and cash generation in 2019.","With just over $6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and considering cash interest expense, taxes, patient contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, we generated roughly $2.8 billion of cash in 2019 that was available for dividend and debt reduction. This was closer to $3 billion, excluding tax repaid on divestitures. As a result, and together with divestiture proceeds, we reduced net debt by $3 billion in 2019, closing the year with nearly $2.3 billion of cash on balance sheet. These are critical variables to consider as we think about our ability to meet our commitments as we undertake our turnaround and business transformation, which brings me to our financial outlook.","To begin, I think it's important to recognize that 2020 will be the first full year of what we expect will be a multiyear turnaround. For our first phase in 2020, specifically, we have set three priorities: one, establish a strong base of sales and earnings; two, rebuild the underlying business momentum; and three, continue to reduce debt, while maintaining our current dividend.","To start, establishing a strong base of sales and earnings in 2020 will involve a combination of realizing several carryover impact from 2018, normalization of certain costs in our P&L and stabilizing our underlying profitability as investments and efficiencies take hold. For instance, the divestitures and business exits we have previously disclosed will result in $110 million reduction in EBITDA versus 2019.","Also as Miguel mentioned earlier, we expect a normal level of incentive compensation in 2020, and this will represent approximately $140 million in additional costs versus 2019 levels. We expect roughly $150 million negative impact to EBITDA from a combination of supply chain cost inflation in Canada and rest of the world markets as well as carryover distribution losses and commodity inflation in certain U.S. categories where we've seen aggressive price-based competition.","Finally, unfavorable currency is likely to negatively impact our 2020 EBITDA by approximately $60 million versus 2019. This totals approximately $160 million relative to 2019 EBITDA. Of that total, approximately $310 million of impact should be realized in the first half of the year and results in a roughly 49% first half, 51% second half split to EBITDA for the year.","Beyond these factors, we expect to stabilize and align profitability and maintain industry-leading margins as we find efficiencies to reinvest behind our brands, improve capabilities and rebuild business momentum. And finally, below EBITDA, we should hit run rate levels in noncash stock-based compensation, representing $110 million negative impact to EBIT versus 2019, a roughly $270 million reduction in other income due to $180 million run-off of noncash prior service credit amortization from patients and post-retirement benefits we have previously disclosed as well as lower interest income and patient asset returns.","And I would note here that versus the time of the merger, our P&L will move from net neutral to net expense between prior service credit amortization and costs from the amortization of definite live intangibles. And finally, our effective tax rate reverted to a high end of the 20%, 22% run rate we have discussed in the past. While this below-the-line impact amount to about $0.38 of EPS pressure, note that they are primarily noncash in nature.","In addition, we do not expect our turnaround efforts will involve large cash for restructuring. And 2020 CapEx is expected to be around $750 million. Therefore, our free cash generation as a percentage of net income should go up, and we continue to expect to generate healthy levels of cash flow, at least $500 million in excess of our normal dividend payout in 2020.","Our second priority for 2020, rebuilding our underlying business momentum involves several decisive actions already underway. For instance, I mentioned our focus on gross profit improvement on our last call. And in 2020, we foresee better product mix through focused investments and rationalizing underperforming SKUs to remove complexity from our supply chain.","In fact, 2018 was the first year our U.S. zone reduced its total SKU count since the Kraft Heinz merger. In 2020, we will accelerate the rate of reduction to bring us back to below 2016 levels. We will also strengthen brand support with more total marketing dollars, a 30% boost in working media and by better prioritizing our spending according to portfolio roles.","Our supply chain efficiency initiatives are well underway, targeting positive net productivity. And all the investments and capabilities are being made to drive functional excellence, realize our long-term strategy and improve fixed cost efficiency. Our goal across all this activity is not only to meet our 2020 plan, but to strengthen our momentum as the year progresses.","Finally, earlier today, we, together with our Board of Directors, announced that we are maintaining our current dividend. We believe our cash generation will remain at healthy levels, fully fund our plans and initiatives and allow us to continue meeting all our obligations as we transform the business and return Kraft Heinz to sustainable growth.","For instance, we will meet all of our 2020 debt maturities from cash already on hand. At the same time, we will not sacrifice necessary investments in the business because we are even more confident in our long-term prospects behind our new enterprise strategy, portfolio prioritization and the growth initiatives we will unveil in May. After meeting our obligations and invest in the business, maintaining a strong dividend to shareholders is a priority of the company, especially during this important period of transformation.","Investment-grade status also remains important to us, but we understand that the decline of our leverage may not come as rapidly as desired. We will utilize excess cash generation as well as potential divestiture proceeds to reduce leverage below 4x as soon as practical. And regarding the prospect of divestitures, we will continue to evaluate opportunities that are consistent with our strategy, in no rush and with price discipline as always.","With that, I will turn it back to Miguel for his closing comments.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you, Paulo. While we will provide more details on our plans in May, I would like to close our prepared comments by describing how we want to see Kraft Heinz in 2020 and beyond and the type of organization we are now confident we can create. First and foremost, we want our people obsessed about the consumer, understanding and predicting the future, passionate for our brands, building a culture of creativity, being more external focused and digitally transformed. We want them obsessed with customer satisfaction and service levels, accomplishing this with excitement for perfect sales execution, continuous improvement in our factories and being disciplined against our strategy.","To fund our growth, we want our people to embrace efficiency through a continuous improvement mindset and being proud, low-cost producers. We want to attract people that truly value and define ownership in terms of accountability, agility, loyalty and a focus on the collective good. And we want a team that understands that a talent pool with pride, high engagement, low turnover can serve as a school for leadership to truly be the key to winning. There is a lot of work ahead of each one of us. We know that we are interested by all of our stakeholders to turn this business around, and that is exactly what we are going to do.","Now we would like to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Miguel Patricio","Good morning.","Paulo Basilio","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","I guess, Miguel, first off, I know you're likely to expand on a lot of this at the Analyst Day later this year. But perhaps, you can give us a sense if you anticipate being able to ramp up in 2020, specifically the continuous productivity work that you've previously highlighted rather than the deal-driven cost savings actions in the past really to help fund some of the acquired brand investment that you're talking about, and I guess, perhaps, or even maybe more importantly, if you have the people to execute on that continuous savings work even several levels down from sort of the top level. And then I just got a quick follow-up.","Miguel Patricio","Hi, Andrew, good morning. Well, I share your enthusiasm about the productivity. I think, in the last two years, supply costs were the main reason why we increased our cost base in the company. And I'm very excited with what we have ahead of us and what we can accomplish together. We have a new Head of Global Ops, Flavio, that joined us after being six months as a consultant, and he has an amazing experience on continuous improvement capabilities.","And that is really the base of everything that we're going to do, really thinking on how we can be better every day, how can we increase our productivity, how can we develop a team of specialists in each one of the critical areas. We know where we stand in terms of overall efficiency ratings by manufacturing line, and we are implementing continuous improvement tools and process across the world as we speak.","The goal here is to work towards positive net productivity. We expect to give you more color of that in May. But the fact that we were, this last quarter in U.S., for the first time in two years, with the cost that was this year to previous year gives me a lot of confidence that we are in the right direction. I think that we are seeing \u2013 I\u2019m seeing better engagement, much more enthusiasm in the supply area. And so we have great expectations from this area.","On people, well, as I said before, talent is one of my biggest concerns and was my biggest concern when I arrived at the company. But I have to say that, today, I\u2019m far less concerned than when I arrived, and I\u2019ll give you a couple of reasons. The first one, we were able to attract top, top, top talent to my management team. We have three new members, and they are going to make a big contribution to us for the future.","But you asked me specifically not to talk only about my management team, but the levels below, so let me tell you. One of the things we did was to identify what were the critical roles in the company globally, and we identified or we defined 60 roles \u2013 or 60 critical roles. These 60 people, I have to know them by heart and by soul, and, of course, be sure that they have the right incentives to continue in the company.","But in this team of 60 people, we have a total of 21 years of experience. So it\u2019s \u2013 on average, of course. This is very good, and it\u2019s very important. And the people that we brought from outside also come with an average of 20 years of experience. So I\u2019m less \u2013 much less concerned about experience to that. The positions we had opened, we were able to bring people with great experience.","And finally, if we go even further on the pyramid, I will say that this year, we had the best results ever on attracting MBAs and trainees with pretty impressive results. This year, we attracted 50% more MBAs or candidates for the job with us. And with trainees, 33% more people applied for a training program. And this came as a surprise. And the main reason was that we were very transparent on what the company is today and what we needed.","So we are attracting people with the transformation mindset that like that, that like and enjoy a turnaround. And these are \u2013 this is the type of people that we are bringing out to the company, then I think that it\u2019s absolutely critical.","Now with all that in mind that I said, that is less of a concern. I also said that turnaround \u2013 the turnover is still a big problem for us, especially on the lower levels of the pyramid, and we have to stop that. And I have a KPI, a target specifically on that this year, and I cascaded or shared these targets with all my management team. We are all responsible for a lower turnover rate. So in a nutshell, Andrew, this is what I would have to say about productivity and people.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. Appreciate that. One very quick one. Just you talked about losing some distribution in the frozen category at select retailers. I was hoping you could just provide some context around this. Was this just retailers making moves on \u2013 to better prepare for things like click and collect? Is it just competitive innovation or something else? Thank you so much.","Miguel Patricio","No. Specifically on frozen food was some of our customers increasing the amount of different brands on the shelf and reducing the shelf. It was not only for us, but for the entire category, reducing the amount of shelf for the players that were already there. This is a specific thing for frozen food. I think that the trend in other categories is the opposite. It\u2019s reducing the number of brands and SKUs. But in frozen food, we saw that happening, yes.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you. Thank you very much.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you. Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Miguel Patricio","Good morning.","Paulo Basilio","Good morning.","Chris Growe","Good morning. I just had a question for you, if I could. And just to get a sense of kind of where the company is today in terms of the stabilization and turnaround in 2020. As I think about areas of new investment, is it about offense or defense? Are you \u2013 is the company in a state where you\u2019re working on new innovation that can start to lead the sales growth in 2020? Or is it more about stabilizing what you have and then pushing towards growth in future years? I hope you can help with that.","Miguel Patricio","Okay. So I \u2013 let me give you an idea what we have seen for 2020. 2020 is a year of stabilization, yes, so it\u2019s not a year of playing of, using your words, offense. It\u2019s a year that we want to continue stabilizing the bottom line of the company. But the good news is that we were \u2013 we found resources in our own budget. We sweat the budget to allocate more money behind brands and categories that have higher profitability and have momentum.","Overall, we are increasing media, as Paulo said, by 30%. And in top brands, we are investing even more. So concentrating on what makes the difference. In 2020 \u2013 going further on 2020, yes, we still predict a decline in EBITDA, but 70% of this EBITDA decline, as Paulo mentioned, is \u2013 comes from normalizing our cost base on things like divestitures, the bonus compensation, ForEx, et cetera.","But yes, we are excited and confident that as the year progresses, our level of capabilities, our level of visibility will increase as well, and that\u2019s the feeling that we already have right now. And it\u2019s our expectation to finish the year in a very different way that we start.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for that. I had just one quick question \u2013 second question, which will be in relation to the U.S. division, there were some more exaggerated volume declines there in pricing versus what I expected. I\u2019d just be curious how much of that would be sort of inventory changes that might occur in the quarter and if you expect that also to occur in 2020 as we go through the year.","Miguel Patricio","Okay. Yes, we \u2013 no \u2013 we had, yes, share losses. So the decline in volumes reflect share losses. However, these share losses were predicted. We knew that we would lose this share in the last quarter. And the reasons are that we increased prices and \u2013 especially in commodities that we\u2019re growing disproportionately, like the cheese category and meat category. We decreased the amount of promo. So in 2018 last quarter, there was a substantial amount of promo activity, and some of this promo activity with very low ROIs or even negative ROIs, and we stopped that.","And also we started a program on SKU rationalization that on short term may reduce a little bit the volume, but long term comes with a lot of benefits of less complexity for us and for our customers and less complexity in our factories, lower levels of supply chain losses, et cetera.","We have never done an SKU reduction in the company in five years. We increased the amount of SKUs big time during these five years. So it was time now to start it. We haven\u2019t finished. We\u2019ll continue to \u2013 through 2020. Being more precise on your question about the share \u2013 the \u2013 or the volume loss, I\u2019m expecting to continue in the first quarter, yes, because this \u2013 the growth of the commodities will affect the first quarter. And the price, at least in the first quarter, will continue high.","Specifically on inventories, we are not looking at this as either incremental or as a negative point for 2020. So last year was very negative. This year, our view is that it\u2019s not going to be incremental or the other way around. It\u2019s going to be neutral.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Miguel Patricio","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane","Two questions for me. First, I guess, Miguel, looking at the EBITDA bridge for \u2013 from 2019 to 2020, we\u2019re taking a step back of $460 million. And I know part of that is divestitures, but it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s a significant increase in brand or marketing support. So I guess two questions. One, is the aggregate amount of spend actually go up? And two, behind that, just what gives you the confidence that you have enough resources to kind of fully resource all your plans to drive better revenue growth?","Miguel Patricio","So Bryan, answering your question, we have a slightly \u2013 a slight decrease in marketing for 2020, but we have a big increase in media for 2020. And what\u2019s the \u2013 how will we do that? We are reducing the amount of new products in \u2013 or the amount of innovation in 2020 by 50% and concentrating on innovation that really makes the difference. We are not expecting a decrease in net sales of the innovation next year, but we are going to cut everything that is not accretive, that is cannibalistic, a lot of line extensions that we did in the past.","That thing by itself helps a lot complexity, helps with our customer relationship, helps with us focusing on what really matters and putting our energy and our budget behind innovation that moves the needle. But also the other consequence is that we put more money on product development. We put more money behind agency or agency fees because we have less development and even marketing research.","And putting all these savings on these lines together, we have put it back in media, which allow us literally to sweat the budget and increase media by 30% overall. I would also say that on top of the 30%, we \u2013 because we have less innovation, we are concentrating more in the bigger brands that have more momentum, better margin and that we have to grow. So that is a lot that the \u2013 a rationale behind your question.","Bryan Spillane","Thanks for that. Okay. And Paulo, just one for you on the list of \u2013 on the to-do list is an improvement in gross profits over time. I guess this is more over the multiyear plan. Can you just give us a little bit more insight on like where the opportunities are to recapture some of the gross profit dollars that have kind of leaked out over the last couple of years? Is it going to be productivity? Is it restructuring? Just give us a little bit more color in terms of what leaked and how you recapture it.","Paulo Basilio","Yes. So historically, in the last call, I did a walk-through to this bridge. We\u2019ve lost a lot of \u2013 the main driver, two-thirds of our decline came from gross margin \u2013 right, gross profit. And it was historically a combination of, pretty much, supply chain inflation with low \u2013 or not enough solid initiatives in supply chain to offset this inflation, a proliferation of SKU, right, and dilutive innovation, as Miguel said.","So at the end of the day, a combination of supply chain inflation with low projects, proliferation of SKU with innovation with low \u2013 not very accretive to the margin. Our plans to recover that is pretty much based in the same pillar. It is \u2013 we see that there is an opportunity for us to recover and to do a much better job going forward of \u2013 and now with our supply chain projects that Miguel was mentioning here.","To get \u2013 to have a better efficiency in our cost, we also expect to be more disciplined with the SKUs, with our innovations and concentrate better. So mix and supply chain costs, I think, would be the main two drivers of this improvement in gross profit.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thank you for that.","Paulo Basilio","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks.","Miguel Patricio","Good morning.","Paulo Basilio","Good morning.","Jason English","I think like a lot of people were just trying to triangulate everything you\u2019re saying and pin you down to kind of what the implicit guidance is on a lot of these things. One area that we\u2019re getting questions on right now is on the free cash flow side. Paulo, I think you said that you\u2019re looking to generate free cash flow at least $500 million in excess of dividend. That implies roughly $2.5 billion. Is that sort of the right number to anchor to in fiscal 2020?","Paulo Basilio","That\u2019s correct.","Jason English","Okay. And then coming back to the EBITDA bridges, I appreciate the disclosure on some of the headwinds and some of the moving pieces there. As Mr. Spillane mentioned, not in there explicitly as sort of the reinvestment, but I appreciate you talking through that. Also what we don\u2019t see in that bridge is any sort of headwind from the organic sales erosion and maybe some of the SKU rationalization, some of the other factors you\u2019re talking about that can weigh on venue. So you gave us some disclosure on how you expect to effectively self-fund the reinvestment. What are the offsets that are going to prevent the sales loss from also flowing there into an EBITDA headwind into next year?","Paulo Basilio","Yes. No, Jason. Thanks for the question. I think \u2013 yes, but we listed here the main impact that we\u2019re seeing. And we also mentioned that beyond both impacts, we believe we\u2019re going to hold profitability. So there will be a list of pluses and minus that we expect, some headwinds from sales, some offset from pricing and mix and some other initiatives that we are doing.","So beyond those impacts here, just to get clarity about the number here and the outlook, we expect to hold profitability beyond those \u2013 this $460 million. And that\u2019s a combination, as Miguel, we are investing more in media, investing more in marketing. We are redeploying some investments that we did in specific areas of the company, commercial investments. We have pricing initiatives, revenue management initiatives in the mix that we expect will kind of offset the headwinds that we have in some categories and some sales that are coming.","Jason English","And does the elasticity effect that you\u2019re seeing, or at least we\u2019re seeing, in market to your pricing, does that give you pause on \u2013 in terms of how far you can push those pricing initiatives and some of those RGM initiatives?","Miguel Patricio","Again, we \u2013 just repeating, Jason, what I said before. We had share losses, but we didn\u2019t have surprises. We expected exactly in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year these share losses. We thought that we had to increase prices specifically on \u2013 or especially on products that are commodities because there was a huge increase in the commodities. And as leading \u2013 as leaders in these categories, we should put the price. I also mentioned that we lost share because we reduced the amount of promotion compared with the fourth quarter of 2018.","And we reduced promotion because we believe that we were doing \u2013 we had promotions in the press that were not adding really to the company with negative ROIs that we should be more careful and more disciplined about promotions. And finally, the SKU rationalization, we see this in the last quarter of 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020.","Jason English","Understood. Thank you very much.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Palmer","Good morning.","Miguel Patricio","Good morning.","David Palmer","You talked about customer satisfaction being core. Could you talk about the specific reasons for that, that we would assume supply chain execution, but also on the list would be promotion and innovation effectiveness? Could you just talk also about where that \u2013 those satisfaction scores, so to speak, would be right now? And how are they progressing? And will they take incremental dollars to fix it? And I have a quick follow-up.","Miguel Patricio","So it is a very important question and has to be an obsession. I finished my speech at the beginning saying that I see the company in the future not only obsessed with the consumer, but also obsessed with service level and because our customers are absolutely critical in the results of our company. And in the past, we had big problems on service level. We had big improvement this year, but we still have problems in service levels. I suggested to the Board to have a specific target \u2013 individual target on service level for 2020. I put this target on salespeople, on supply people and procurement people.","So we revised, and we are very close to understand service levels. I have my team in supply now literally running around the country and understanding the KPIs of each one of the customers, how they measure service level because we have to be a mirror of what they are.","So this is, I think, the first thing that is very important for customer satisfaction, but it\u2019s not the only one. It\u2019s the most important, but not the only one. I also think that we have big gaps in trade, marketing and category management that are big opportunities, these three areas to increase customer satisfaction. In U.S., you asked about ranking. We are not in the last quartile, but we are in the third quartile in terms of companies and customer satisfaction. We \u2013 and it\u2019s our intention to move it up, of course.","David Palmer","And I guess, if I \u2013 just a follow-up would be, how did you \u2013 how did this happen? Because on the supply chain side, there are stories out there about how there was a removal of muscle memory that lasted \u2013 that goes back \u2013 way back in \u2013 onto the plant level and that removal removed a lot of continuous improvement ability in terms of your productivity. But also since it\u2019s in a highly complex business, it became critical to have those people. And as you cut costs, all of a sudden, things started going off the rails in terms of productivity.","Could you talk about the people side and how fast you can get that muscle memory back? And in terms of revenue management, promotion management seems to be a big problem. What went wrong there? Some thoughts \u2013 color on those two things. Thanks.","Miguel Patricio","Let me \u2013 those are important questions. I think that the first two years after the acquisition of Kraft Heinz \u2013 of Kraft, there were a lot of synergies that were on the table as possibilities, right? You had two CEOs. You had two headquarters. You have to cut. So there\u2019s the possibility of synergies by cutting. But after two years, cutting becomes dangerous. We cannot have a culture of cutting because it\u2019s \u2013 these are not long-term. But we have to change that culture to a continuous improvement mentality. You can always improve. And actually, the consequence of continuous improvement is productivity. We can always increase productivity. We decreased productivity in the last two years.","And I think that moving forward, it\u2019s a combination of things, new leadership in place, better planning, a different mindset regarding continuous improvement, less innovation that generated a lot of complexity and investing innovation and less SKUs and increased a lot supply chain losses. And so these are absolute drivers of what we have to do for the future, for the success of the future.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thank you so much. So just a quick question, I guess, just regarding overall portfolio mix and then kind of perspective on divestments for even potentially 2020. As you\u2019ve discussed last call and on this call, productivity, gross margin recovery is key focus. But then at the same time, we\u2019re seeing some increased volume elasticity on some of the commodity-driven brand and categories that you play in.","So kind of as you think about divestment potential going forward, vis-\u00e0-vis kind of productivity and gross margin recovery potential, and then you\u2019ve also mentioned some of your flagship brands, like, as of now, and I realize we\u2019ll hear more about this in May, but kind of as of now, like, what are some examples that you consider your flagship brands? And then also, like, why not consider divesting some of the potentially lower-margin, more commodity-driven categories that you now play in? Thanks.","Miguel Patricio","So I will \u2013 thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good question, but it\u2019s a long answer, so I\u2019m going to divide the answer in two. I will cover the first part on portfolio and brands, and I will ask Paulo to give you more color on the rest of the question.","Portfolio, you are mentioning magic words. I think portfolio is absolutely critical for us to define the strategy for the future. Portfolio is all about choices. And when I think about our portfolio, we have to see the portfolio in two ways: first, about countries; and second, about brands and categories.","Let me talk first about the countries. We have operations in 40 different countries. And the way we\u2019ve been operating has been literally, country by country, defining what each country has to do. And we need to have a higher-level view. Not all the countries have potential to grow. Not all the countries, we have momentum and we know how to win. Not all countries, we have a great talent and plans and brands to grow.","So when I think about portfolio of countries, we need to define what are the countries that have more potential and put more resources behind these countries and define the role of the other countries. We are going to have countries with different roles to help grow in the other countries, and some that will have a role of growing. When I think about categories and brands, I think it\u2019s the same way of thinking. We have to define where we can win and how we can win in categories. I also would like to say that in the business, especially in U.S., it\u2019s a pretty big business. We have a 97% penetration in household. We play in 56 different categories.","However, there are a lot of similarities among these categories. And one of the things that we\u2019re going to talk about in May is how we are finding similarities among these categories through consumer needs. And better understanding the consumer needs give us a better sense of direction for the future. I don\u2019t want to anticipate that. Maybe I confused you a little bit, but I\u2019m already going to the strategy that we are going to talk to you in more detail in May.","Yes \u2013 and regarding brands and before passing to Paulo, we have, I think, three types of brands, brands that are doing very well and with growth and high margin. We have the second group of brands that are brands that are not doing so well, but have amazing equity and have a huge potential to be repositioned, renovated and bring them to growth. And we have a third group of brands that are less exciting because they\u2019re in categories that are not growing and have less potential for growth. The roles of these brands will be different, right? And that is part of the portfolio conversation that we owe you.","Paulo Basilio","Now on the divestiture of this year that you asked, I think, aligned with our strategy, we will opportunistically explore divestitures, but we are going to be very disciplined on price and, more importantly, with no hurry. So we want to explore potentially the parts of the business that makes sense, aligned with our strategy, with no hurry to execute that and only at the right price. So no time commitment around that.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, super. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And that\u2019s all the questions we have \u2013 all the time we have for questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris Jakubik for any closing remarks.","Chris Jakubik","Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. For any analysts that have follow-up questions, myself and Andy Larkin will be available. And for anybody in the media, Michael Mullen will be available to answer your calls. Thanks very much, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

My name is Chelsea, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher Jakubik","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our view on the path forward from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our CFO. After that, Paulo Basilio, President of our U.S. zone, will join us for the Q&A session.","Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.","Lastly, as you may have seen in today's press release, we conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area with the assistance of external legal and accounting advisers and found we should have recorded $25 million in prior periods, which we booked in Q4 2018. To be clear, we do not expect this to be material to our current period or any prior period financial statements.","Now let's turn to Slide 2 and I will hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Hees","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. ","At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.","From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume\/mix nearly 4%.","In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of our new sauces plant in Brazil, and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.","In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying strategically advanced capabilities. We had strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone, and a 1\/10 market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and Evolv Ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.","So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in United States has been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands where we have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, Kraft and our frozen and snack categories at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018. Turning around other key brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer hotdogs to name one to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines. And building new brands into meaningful platforms for growth, like P3, which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years; and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019. ","Where we fell short in 2018 was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize that our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all-time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. ","The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in ZBB costs. In fact, ZBB delivered savings across all fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.","To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs, with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process, procedures and organization structure.","In the end, we see three takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.","Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials.","David Knopf","Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone. As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S., with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.","From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume\/mix growth was 4%, with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. ","Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World segment.","And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing price gaps to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments and support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.","Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.","Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off.","Bernardo Hees","Now it's time for us to focus on the year ahead, what we see in front of us and how best to grow our business for the long term. Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on several front, continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvest in brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and, finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. ","Given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we're seeing, we could focus on maintaining or expanding margins but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share. By slowing our pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time, we have not and we will not.","We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by: driving consumption and market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and category advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in light of the industry backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. ","And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiatives, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.","By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we'll be launching a record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. ","In Canada, the priority is reignite consumption in peanut butter as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, whitespace initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in Foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and whitespace.","We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs, taking advantage of our superior media efficiency or cost per impression, and increasing our media effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.","In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.","Now let me turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals.","David Knopf","I'll start with our financial expectations going forward on Slide 6. Regarding top line, we are now well positioned to continue organic net sales growth, driven by incremental consumption gains. This will reflect volume\/mix growth from innovation, distribution and whitespace initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives.","On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandising support and distribution. And price gaps are currently in a better place, so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.","From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year, trade timing in Canada, comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth, with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4-percentage-point headwind to net sales.","Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes: commercial gains offset by stepped-up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.","In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with a first quarter that is likely to see a high-teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.","Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.","Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.","The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. ","The recent transactions we have announced, Indian beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.","I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India beverage and Canada Natural Cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.","Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. ","Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close.","Bernardo Hees","Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I think it's useful to put our progress to date, our plans and priorities as well as our expectations beyond 2019 into context. When we put Kraft Heinz together in mid-2015, our focus through 2017 was clarity on necessary product renovation and supply chain integration, taking out costs that drops no benefit to our consumers, establishing retool and routines, and testing and learning new tools to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.","Beginning in 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and whitespace expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns. From 2020, we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines, as the full leverage of our advantage brands, cost structure and investments flows to the P&L.","So to summarize, we have continued to invest and focus on building our highly scalable operational model, to position ourselves for sustainable organic growth and returns and doing so at the time when the need for industry to modernize and consolidate is more evident than it was 5 or even 3 years ago.","Now we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","I guess, I'll kick it off with you mentioned, I think, David, that you thought that there was an opportunity for greater strategic advantage, I think, were the words you used for greater divestiture activity today than previously. I was hoping to get a little more clarity on what you mean by that. Is it a matter of just simply strengthening the balance sheet because you see more opportunities for more transformational deals now than you did before? Is it that valuation opportunities on those potential assets for sale are greater than maybe what you would have expected previously? I'm trying to get a better handle on that.","Bernardo Hees","Andrew, it's Bernardo, let me take this part of the question. I think we're seeing a large [indiscernible] in the industry. And we are going through commercially a good momentum, right, with acceleration in consumption, in share gains, in volumes, right? Also true that you're coming out of the integration, we know more about the categories and the competitive advantage of each one of our brands than ever before. So with that in mind, our decision here was to execute the strategy on deleveraging faster so we can better position the company for future consolidation, right? As usual, we reward more things than we're actually doing. But as we did in the second half of last year, we did divestiture of India Beverage and the Canadian Natural Cheese business. I think the good framework for the things we're looking today, and that's exactly the point you are right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","I guess, two questions, or two points, I guess, related to the, I guess, the build from -- through -- from the end of '18 through getting back to growth in 2020. One is just how much incremental investment is contemplated in your 2019 plan? So how much more are you spending in addition of -- in terms of what you stepped up in 2018? And then, second, the visibility in your business has not been very good. I think we've experienced that here in the second half. So I think it would be really helpful if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of sort of how you see a bridge to actually getting to some growth in 2020.","David Knopf","Bryan, thanks for the question. This is David. So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really, the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX; and to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or a roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the four main drivers behind that.","So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then, finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year.","So taken together, this will put us where we still have the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA that we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today that we're able to create in the second half of 2018. And in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and whitespace opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce.","So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then, on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing and our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth 2020 going forward.","Bernardo Hees","Bryan, just to add to what David just said to the numbers, we're seeing a strong consumption-driven growth in our business today that we plan to accelerate. And the base we're assessing for 2019 get us to the right metrics and KPIs in all our key investments, marketing, innovation, supply chain, channels, digital. So with that base, we are very confident as we grow the business in 2019 and '20, that EPS and EBITDA grows together with that perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO.","Kenneth Zaslow","I have one question. What are the key changes that will take place to change the planning and execution of the savings so we can become more -- so they can become more reliable and kind of put it into a better action? Are they going to be management changes? Is it going to be a change to the methodology? Oversight? Can you talk about that?","David Knopf","Ken, thanks for the question, this is David. So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year decline we saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then, on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we had 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3, and we didn't see the sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question.","Bernardo Hees","Ken, I think it's a very fair point, and even though we're disappointed with the miss, that's pretty much focused, like David said, in the supply chain operations in United States. We did took several actions to not allow this to happen again, right? Actions in the planning process, in organization structure and position ourselves to make sure our savings curve really match, right, the timing and the effectiveness for the year. So even though we understand the reasons of the miss, and we saw in the Q4, higher cost and more volumes coming through the pipe. And we could not offset to timing of our savings curve, we did took actions, process, planning and structure to not repeat that again.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","First, just for clarification, can you provide a bit more detail on the circumstances behind the SEC subpoena on the procurement side? It sounds like it originated externally as opposed to finding something internally. So just curious for the circumstances there. And then, on the pricing front, you mentioned increases in the U.S. by the end of Q1. Can you give us a rough idea of what percentage of your business that represents? And given we've seen the price gap move up versus private label in a lot of your key product categories in the U.S. over the last few years, do you think there might need to be a broader reset of price gaps at some point, particularly with the market share momentum we're seeing at private label?","David Knopf","This is David. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the first part of your question and then hand it over to Paulo to U.S -- pricing in the U.S. So the company was notified by the SEC regarding an investigation into the company's procurement area. Following this, we conducted a very thorough internal investigation with the support of an independent law firm and accounting firm. And we determined that we should have recorded $25 million in prior periods, which we booked in Q4 2018. And to put into context, that compares to our overall procurement spend of over $11 billion, which excludes big 4 commodities spend. So this misstatement was not material to our current or prior year financial statements. And finally, we did implement several improvements to internal controls and took remedial measures to mitigate the likelihood that this happens again. So with that, I'll hand it over to Paulo to address pricing.","Paulo Basilio","Thanks, Dave. Let me start from the -- answering the private label question and then we move to the 2019 pricing. Why we're seeing the private label expanding and it's doing so at a more -- we are seeing this happening at a more restrained pace, around 0.2 points of share in Q4. It was a material step down from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing the most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and retail competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. In natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic, and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the value proposition of the market and continue to innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very conscious about the balance between sales and cost while still providing the best value equation and helping to drive category growth. And we are seeing, we already announced, this thing is going to take effect in Q1. And we expect overall -- our overall pricing to turn positive over the course of '19.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","Bernardo, as you know, one of the bare thesis over the years on the 3G philosophy has been that, I guess, the intense cost-saving efforts will, over the long run, sort of erode brand equities. And I realize you've had a better top line lately, but one could argue, it took a $300 million spending infusion to get there. And I think, more importantly, you took a $15 billion write-down on 2 of your biggest brands, Kraft and Oscar Mayer. And to me, that literally means the brand equities there aren't what they used to be. So when investors are looking at the consistent financial disappointments at Kraft, maybe even bringing the eye into the discussion. And if they ask why -- if the 3G belt-tightening strategy goes too far and if it damages brands, is there at least some evidence starting to point to yes there? I'm just curious for your thoughts on that.","Bernardo Hees","Ken, let David talk about the impairment here that you just mentioned. Then I come back here to talk about the model that what is implicit in your question here. Thanks for that. David, can you start?","David Knopf","Thanks, Bernardo. So in terms of the impairment, the write-down was primarily reflected -- it reflected revised margin expectations and this was for really 3 businesses of ours: first, the Kraft natural cheese business; second, our Oscar Mayer cold cuts business, where we've talked about issues that we had in the first part of the year; and then, third, our Canada retail business. And really, the fundamental driver behind the reduction in expectations was driven by our second half performance, okay, which was primarily driven by supply chain issues that we had in the cost side as you know. And then, just to provide a little more context, since the merger, we've also seen significant pressure on valuations from a higher discount rate come into play, which has partially offset albeit by factions but that's really the context around the impairment. And I'll hand over to Bernardo to answer the rest of your question.","Bernardo Hees","Ken, look, we still believe strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future, right? First, let's remember, we continue to be rated with leading industry margins, right? And now, we are growing, right, at the same level as the top-tier companies within similar portfolio, right? So that's very important to put in perspective. Second, the miss we had, and we're acknowledging here properly, has been focused on operations, supply chain, United States. The commercial momentum -- consumption growth continue to accelerate rightly so. With the investments that we're doing since 2018, now 2019. We can say we have the right base to be growing, through consumption, volumes and share, at the same time, maintaining high leading margins to the industry. Into 2020, like David highlights to their alternate numbers, right, we do believe to that base, we are going to be in a very solid position to be growing top line and bottom line. Not only that, we are working more actively the portfolio. And now, with the reduction of the dividend, allows us to have more flexibility in our balance sheet to really deleverage faster and position ourselves to more consolidation in the future that we believe is necessary and will happen with that model. And so we are confident in the things we're doing, even though we acknowledge, we did have the miss in the fourth quarter, like highlighted by David.","Kenneth Goldman","Can I ask you a very quick follow-up? David and Bernardo, thank you for that, that's helpful. David, I think you mentioned that it was more of a short-term, like the last couple of quarter issue with the 2 brand and maybe discount rates have risen. The companies generally don't take write-downs because recent performance was bad and because discount rates have risen. Isn't there something broader and longer term that usually leads to these kind of impairments?","David Knopf","Yes, that's a great question and thanks for that. Just to be clear, by far and away, the majority of the impairment, which was really concentrated in these 3 businesses that I mentioned, it was, by far and away, driven by the second half performance and the new level of margin and profitability that we're talking about versus what it was before. So the margin profile and what we established in the second half was really the key driver behind the impairment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","I just had a couple of questions, but I think they're reasonably short. Can you give us some sense of the size of the assets that you wish to sell that haven't been announced? And would it be something like on the magnitude of 5% of the revenue base? And then, I had a question about the savings programs. I think you made a statement, David, in your script that in the forecast, the savings programs had been \"pushed out.\" So I'm a little confused as to kind of why that's happening and why can't you achieve the internal savings at the same time that you're generating the revenue performance? And then, related to that, if you didn't hit the savings that you expected in the fourth quarter, don't those savings programs show up in like the first quarter of '19 or second quarter of '19? I mean, I don't think there's -- they shouldn't disappear but it feels like, within the guidance, that they did, and I just maybe don't understand what's happened right there.","Bernardo Hees","David, it's Bernardo. Let me drive the first part of the question. We're not discussing here size or our soul. What you're saying is that we will work our portfolio to strengthen our balance sheet as we're doing the dividend to have more flexibility for future consolidation as we see it. As David said, our objective is to deleverage, right, to 3x in the middle term at a faster pace than we're doing today. With that, and the knowledge you have of the portfolio today, with our competitive advantage by brands and category, allows us to be in a very good position to understand the magnitude that what we can do or we cannot do. I don't want to elaborate more than we are doing right now. With that, David, can you open again the '18 and '19 to clarify here to David?","David Knopf","David, this is David. Thanks for the question. So on the savings side, we were overly optimistic on our ability to offset significant inflation in the quarter. And again, that drove a significant part of the miss. So this savings miss was really a combination of 2 things, under-delivery from supplier negotiations and delayed manufacturing projects. And to give you a little bit of color on what some of those projects were like, they included line optimizations, yield improvements and assumed even better performance on some of our footprint plans that we discussed previously. So because of this miss, as Bernardo said, we took significant action to address our processes, planning and structure internally and simultaneously have spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned. As a function of that, our savings curve is being pushed out as we implement those changes, as we revisit our savings programs going forward. So that's really what's driving the delay in the savings curve, and that's embedded in my 2019 expectations.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Your guidance for next year suggests that the majority of the synergies you realized on consolidating Heinz and Kraft will have effectively been wiped out. In that context, I'd love to hear your thought process or rationale on continuing to pursue a strategy of consolidation. Where do you see the value creation coming from? This would certainly suggest that maybe there's not as much opportunity as some of us maybe once envisioned.","David Knopf","Thanks for the question. This is David. So since the merger, EBITDA has been held back by more than $1 billion versus what we had really kind of set out for. And within that, we had nearly $0.5 billion of costs that we put back into the business, okay? These are costs that are different and independent from the cost that we took out in the integration, right? So most of the synergies and the integration savings that we captured were nonconsumer, noncommercial-related cost savings, okay? So the synergies that we realized are very much intact. The costs that we put in are squarely within different areas, and we're putting costs in that are consumer-facing and drive commercial growth, okay? So these are things like expanding our innovation pipeline, our go-to-market infrastructure in the U.S. and international, our digital and e-commerce capabilities. And while there's a significant amount of investment we put behind us, we are starting to see the returns, which is why we're growing in the second half. On top of that, we also had significant amount of FX headwinds that also affected our sales and EBITDA trajectory. And then, finally, the inflation and the inability to executing it to the saving curves as we talked about that. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to address it as well.","Bernardo Hees","Jason, I actually was -- as Dave said, the investments we're doing and the things we're doing are not correlated to the savings we got to the merger. That is still here, and we are guiding more as the year goes. I actually would say the opposite. I think we are more prepared in the capabilities and we're more ready for industry consolidation to better performance in the future than we were 2, 3 or 5 years ago. To that sense, I think we're having more firepower with a better balance sheet profile is important.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Just wanted to understand, you mentioned your -- that you should be measured on organic growth, and that hasn't come through the way I think people might have expected. But I think there's been forgiveness around that because you are deal guys and [Technical Difficulty] about the outlook.","Christopher Jakubik","Michael, I'm sorry, you faded a bit there. We didn't quite hear the...","Michael Lavery","Deal-driven but...","Christopher Jakubik","Michael, could you repeat the question? You kind of faded there a little bit.","Michael Lavery","Yes. Sorry. No problem. You've said a couple of years ago that you should be measured on organic growth for your business, and that obviously has had some struggles. You're also known as deal guys but we haven't seen a deal yet either. Can you just help us understand why somebody should be excited about the prospects from here? Is it a deal that you know you can get done? Is it organic growth or is it a combination?","Bernardo Hees","Lavery, it's Bernardo again. Look, I think, if you see the second half performance of our commercial initiatives and returns of our investment, it's going to see a very positive scenario in that sense, right? We're having volumes, consumption and market share gains in the vast majority of our categories. Even categories that have been declining for quite some time are seeing a momentum, right? And we do know there is more to come. Not only that, even with the miss of the fourth quarter, we continue to operate at industry-leading margins, and we think the 2019 base that David just highlight is a base we can grow sales and EBITDA going forward. With the actions we're taking on dividend and the work we're doing in portfolio, it remains to be successful and we are confident we can be. We will have a balance sheet that's more flexible and more prepared for future consolidation. So in that sense, I think the commercial momentum is happening. In that sense, I think even with the miss in U.S. operations, we still have the base of the margin here that allows us from this base to build 2020 and beyond and the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation for us to be a consolidator if the industry goes our way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Bernardo, I had a question about the supply chain. It was a -- you had very poor order fill rates. I think, a year or 2 ago, you had issues in frozen potatoes, you had issues with sliced lunchmeat. And now, this year, we're having more supply chain issues. And the commentary that there's some cost savings going on in the supply chain, I'm still, I guess, uncomfortable with it because it indicates that maybe you need to try to make it more efficient. It sounds like you need a bigger investment in the supply chain. Maybe you need to expand the footprint, increase flexibility and increase capabilities. Is there going to be a big dollar investment in people and in the footprint that's necessary as part of this rebase?","Bernardo Hees","Thanks, Rob, for the question. No, actually, I think it's important to understand what did not happen in the fourth quarter was this ramp-up of the savings, right? We are in the same level as the third quarter. And actually, let me put perspective a little bit to what you said. We came into 2018 as one of the best service provider in the industry. Our own time in food tends to raise. Like we said in the original highlight is really now at top quartile worldwide. So in that sense, the whole investment in footprint, right, capacity and service is already behind us. Do we have more -- we always have things to do and improve, but to the day that you're asking, it's actually the opposite. We did believe there was more saved timing on the savings curve, and that for that, we're taking full responsibility, did not materialize, and they will come to life in 2019, '20 and beyond. But there is no bigger investment in supply chain, to your point because I'm operating better or in the same level of the third quarter, with one of the best service in United States today. With that said, let me pass over to Paulo to detail the supply chain cost here in United States.","Paulo Basilio","Rob, this is Paulo. So no, I just want to reaffirm here what Bernardo is saying that 2018 was a great year for our supply chain in terms of service. Think about the 4 pillars of supply chain: quality; safety; service; and cost. It's completely fair to say that our supply chain delivered very well 3 of the 4 pillars: quality; safety; and a great service to support the strong volume that we had in the year. In cost, we all -- throughout the year, we're not able to deliver the additional savings we're expecting, and we are not having more inflation also -- we're also expecting at the end of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe","I have two questions for you. A real quick one would be just to be clear on the $250 million of EBITDA pressure from divestitures. Does that include -- incorporate what's already happened or would also could happen going forward? And if I could just ask a second question in relation to a comment you make in the release about your return on investment being strong in the fourth quarter and the year. Obviously, if you measure that based on market share or even top line growth, that's a fair comment. But the degree of profit that it took to achieve that growth is quite significant and I think would really weigh on that overall calculation of that return on investment. So I just want to get a better sense of how you're measuring your return on investment as you call it and how do we think about that going forward, given the extreme cost in this quarter?","David Knopf","Chris, this is David. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the first part and then hand it over to Paulo to address your second. So the $250 million you mentioned, approximately $70 million of that is related to the divestitures that we've made to date, okay? And then, the remaining amount is really the FX headwinds that we're seeing in some of our international markets. So this does not include any future divestitures that we're considering. It only includes the divestitures that we've executed to date, the two deals that Bernardo mentioned earlier.","Paulo Basilio","So I'm going to talk a little bit about the pricing and the return on the pricing investment that we had here. If you consider -- you think about our second half as a whole, okay, and you consider that, actually we invested 1% in price when you exclude the impact from commodity, and the 0.4% that we invested specifically to close the gaps in the natural cheese, and you see the performance in volume that we had growing almost 4%, I think it's clear to see that even though this was only -- was not the only lever of the volume improvement, you can see that we have a very strong return on this particular investment. But also it is important to say that our volume improvement was also supported with a much better service level, as we're talking, strong innovation launches, renovation and additional brand and channel support besides the high level of in-store activity and promotions that we're discussing here.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kraft Heinz Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hello everyone, and thanks for joining our business update for the first quarter of 2017. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO, Paulo Basilio our CFO, and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with, GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now, let's turn to slide 2 and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. From an overall perspective, I will start by repeating what I said in today's press release. While our top line results reflect a slow start to the year, we remain on track with the key initiatives that can drive another year of sustainable organic growth for The Kraft Heinz Company. There is no doubt that the U.S. consumption was softer than expected. As you know, the shift in merchandizing windows such as Easter was expected, however other largely Canada-related factors caused our overall consumer takeaway to be weaker than anticipated. George will discuss these in more detail.","In addition, results in Canada also held back organic growth in Q1. This was driven by go-to market agreements with key retailers being made much later this year than in past years. And this was largely due to our choice to not sign into significant price or reenter requests that have come about in the Canadian retail market. As a result, we lost frequency and depth of promotional activity during the quarter. We also choose to delay several innovation launches from March to April. In the end, however, we are confident that the sacrifice we made in sales will lead to a resumption of profitable growth for both Kraft Heinz and for our retail partners.","Another area that makes me confident for organic growth in the year to go is the solid returns we are seeing from our Big Bets that are already in the marketplace and the fact that the rest of our 2017 pipeline is on track. I'm not going to get into the specific initiatives that have not hit the market yet, but what we saw in Q1 was a very healthy contribution from both Year 2 Big Bets and the new-to-the-world initiatives. This included accelerated consumption in Mac & Cheese and frozen meals, from products like Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meals that you have seen in the United States. Further gains from Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise across Europe, Brazil and Australia, the growth of Planters in China, the launch of Heinz Seriously Good Sauces and No Salt, No Sugar Added Heinz Beans in the UK, just to name a few.","Importantly, the investment we made are driving the solid organic growth trends we're now seeing in both Europe and the Rest of the World markets. In short, our strategy of prioritizing fewer, bigger, and bolder bets is paying off. Underpinning all of this, we remain on track with our cost savings initiatives and the pace of savings is coming in very much as expected so far this year. Cumulative savings from our Integration Program are approximately $1.3 billion and we continue to generate savings from ZBB and supply chain initiatives in all our zones outside of North America.","Lastly, but just as important, in March, we strengthened our vision for Growing a Better World by unveiling new goals for sustainable sourcing and animal welfare. This includes a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water, and waste across our manufacturing network by 15% over the next five years. We also committed to purchase 100% palm oil and derivatives from suppliers certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. And we implemented a zero-tolerance policy among suppliers for willful acts of animal abuse or neglect. Finally, our commitment to fighting global hunger is even more aggressive and I'm proud to say that by the year 2021, Kraft Heinz will donate one billion meals to families in need.","That's a broad overview of where we stand after the first quarter of 2017. Overall, a soft start to the year financially, but on track for another year of profitable organic growth.","So, let's turn to slide three to review the details of our Q1 financial results. As it relates to total company sales, there are two things to highlight. First, we had solid price realization in our Rest of the World market, particularly Latin America, to offset higher local input costs as well as in the United States. These gains were partially offset by promotional timing, primarily in Canada and Europe. Second, for the reasons I noted earlier, we saw volume\/mix declines in North America. And these more than offset the solid and encouraging gains in the Rest of the World and Europe markets from condiments and sauces as well as the Big Bets highlighted.","Net EBITDA, quite simple, our first quarter results were held back by a combination of the volume\/mix declines in North America and the business investments to support our growth agenda in the Rest of the World markets. And these more than offset the benefit of ongoing cost savings and initiatives in North America and Europe. That said, we expect this to improve in the second half of the year. As adjusted EPS however, we continued to see strong growth mainly driven by the refinancing of the preferred stock. Going forward, we expect a combination of profitable top-line growth and EBITDA to again become the main drivers of the EPS growth for the full year.","Now, I will hand it over to George and Paulo to highlight our performance in each reporting segment and what to expect in each area going forward. George?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide four and our performance in the United States. There is no questioning the slow start to 2017 with greater than expected declines in January and February (8:40) forecast Heinz and the food industry in general. However, we saw marked improvement as the quarter progressed. And we feel good about the early read of Easter trading and the balance of the year, especially the second half.","Let's start with the two areas that have presented headwinds to us in Q1 versus prior year. The first includes several calendar changes versus the prior year. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we think the shift in our merchandising windows versus last year, driven by Easter timing and the impact on measured-channel consumption, as well as our market share where we typically over-index during that period. We also experienced one less day in the quarter due to comparisons with Leap Year in 2016, as well as a delay in tax returns from February last year to March this year. That impacted families that claim charge tax credit.","Importantly, these families are a big, core component of the Kraft Heinz consumer base. Together, these changes in the calendar versus last year drove more than half of the 3.6% decline in measured-channel category growth and market share you can see in the chart on the right. The second factor is distribution losses of certain less profitable products in measured-channel, primarily club that affected our consumption numbers in certain cheese and meat categories. Beyond that, the combination of our non-measured channel performance and other trade-related impacts essentially offset one another.","On our last call, I also mentioned that we exited the year with some of our Q4 shipments needing to be worked off in January. While this did, in fact, occur, it was partially offset by some shipments related to retailer demand for early Easter builds in certain categories, like cream cheese. Going forward, however, I do feel good about our chances of driving sequential improvement in organic growth from Q1 to Q2, and more importantly, from Q2 through the second half of the year. As a start, we've already seen more favorable consumption trends in both March and April. Also, our Big Bets that are now in the market are driving consumption gains, including double-digit growth in frozen entrees after years of decline behind the successful introductions of Devour and SmartMade brands.","We also had strong growth in our mac and cheese portfolio from renovation and innovation last year, as well as ongoing innovation-led growth in Lunchables. And we have more to come, including new ways to enjoy Philly with the launch of Philadelphia Cheesecake Cups, along with Bagel Chips and Cream Cheese Dips, which have had strong initial consumer response. The launch of Capri Sun Sport and Cracker Barrel Oven Baked Mac & Cheese, as well as the renovation of our Oscar Mayer hotdog line with simpler ingredients, no nitrites or nitrates, no artificial preservatives, no by-product and no change in the price.","Importantly, as we begin to complete key modernization projects within our footprint activity and remove a self-imposed restriction on introducing new products in our meat business, we will start to increase both innovation and renovation activities to improve our performance in challenged categories, particularly at the back half of the year. And beginning in Q2, you are going to start to see us better leverage Kraft Heinz scale at retail. This will come in the form of increased in-store activity with several scale events in Q2, including Easter, Memorial Day and Feed Your Family, Feed The World, scale event we launched just last week as part of our fight to end the global hunger that Bernardo mentioned earlier.","With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide 5 and our U.S. financials. I think George covered off the key macro drivers. In the end, we saw favorable pricing primarily in cheese that was more than offset by the volume\/mix decline from consumption weakness across categories. Foodservice, cheese, meats and nuts were the categories most affected and they offset ongoing solid gains from Lunchables, frozen meals, and macaroni & cheese.","Moving to EBITDA, we had incremental Integration savings, just less than $100 million. Note that in Q1, the pace of net savings versus the prior year was consistent with our expectations and we do expect that pace to pick up more in the second half of the year. In the first quarter however, the incremental savings together with pricing were more than offset by both the decline in volume\/mix and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable key commodity costs in coffee and bacon. Although I would note that, versus last year, adjusted EBITDA was down only 1.4%, considering we were up against significant key commodity costs favorability in Q1 last year.","Let's turn to slide 6 and Canada. Bernardo mentioned, Canada's Q1 results versus the prior year were significantly impacted by later-than-usual go-to-market agreements with key retailers. As a result (16:03) was a double-digit decline in volume\/mix from a combination of reduced in-store activity and a related decline in shipments. At EBITDA, we had a slightly greater percentage decline than what we saw in organic net sales, reflecting the volume\/mix decline and change to promotional levels versus the prior year.","That being said, I think there are three important factors to consider as we move forward. First, we had significantly favorable pricing relative to local input costs within Q1 EBITDA last year. Second, despite the headwinds seen in this Q1, Canada's adjusted EBITDA growth is still in the double-digits on a two-year basis. And third, we are confident that the new go-to-market agreements we've reached in Canada will lead to a resumption of run rate trends in growth and profit margins for the balance of the year.","That brings us to Europe on slide 7 where we saw sequential improvement in overall organic growth, including top-line growth in the UK. Strong currency headwinds continued to be a factor in reported results and net pricing declined due to timing of promotional activity, primarily in UK and Italy. Volume\/mix growth was driven by gains in UK condiments and sauces and this was partially offset by weakness in Italy infant nutrition as well as soup and beverage in Netherlands. Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the UK gives us the confidence that the business is on the right path, and that our investments with retailers in the second half of last year are now paying off.","At adjusted EBITDA, we had solid constant currency gains from strong cost favorability, mainly manufacturing savings that more than offset unfavorable input costs in local currency driven by transactional currency headwinds. Going forward in Europe, while we expect further improvement to our performance in the marketplace and across geographies, we expect Q2 organic top line and EBITDA to be held back by two factors: one, is shipments phasing versus the prior year where some July shipments were pulled into June last year; the second is the likelihood of unfavorable product costs as we will continue to face transactional foreign exchange headwinds within our supply chain in the near-term.","Finally, let's look at our Rest of the World segment on slide 8 where results were consistent with expectations we laid out on our last call. Specifically, our plan for 2017 called for us to go after growth opportunities aggressively and would include significant incremental investments in marketing, go-to-market capabilities and product development that would hold back margins. And Q1 reflected the first stage of this plan. At volume\/mix, we had positive on base performance in both China and from condiments and sauces in Latin America.","We also had favorable shipments related to the timing of Ramadan in Indonesia that were offset by actions we took to realign our distributor network in several countries and mainly affected our exports business. In the end, we are encouraged by seeing our investments paying off, from condiments and sauces across Latin America, and on a more local basis, a strong organic growth in China, India, Korea, and the Middle East and Africa.","At EBITDA, the strong contribution from volume\/mix growth was offset by two factors: one, significant commercial investments in marketing and sales to drive top-line growth in our EMEA region; and two, higher input costs in local currency, particularly affecting our business in India, Egypt and Nigeria. Looking forward, while we expect our investments to continue as a headwind to EBITDA through the second quarter, we also expect organic sales growth to accelerate from Q1 levels as the year progresses.","That concludes our review of Q1 results, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of the year. To begin, there is no doubt that the headwinds we've highlighted before will remain, from highly competitive retail markets to persistent foreign exchange headwinds, especially in Europe here in Q2. But these factors are likely to affect everybody in our industry, not just Kraft Heinz. That said, we are expecting profitable organic sales growth to ramp up as the year progresses, especially in the second half.","Why do we believe this? First, as George noted, we have a much stronger retail calendar in the U.S. for the balance of the year, beginning with better retail events in Q2. Second, we expect and have already being seeing our restoration of normal go-to-market activity in Canada, including our innovation and marketing agendas in light of having completed all agreements with key retailers. And third, we expect the positive investment-driven consumption trends in Europe, Latin America and Asia, Middle East and Africa to continue. At the profit line, we still expect the progression of our 2017 results to reflect aggressive up-front investment in growth and favorable commodity trends to be followed by a step-up in cost savings in the second half of the year. We are on track to deliver the $1.7 billion in cumulative Integration Program savings, net of inflation and business investments in North America by end of 2017.","We do, however, have significant work ahead of us in order to deliver our plan. We must continue to execute our footprint related manufacturing line start-ups, which are well underway. We have an extensive pipeline of Big Bets innovations in whitespace in Q2 and throughout the second half of the year. And we will keep our focus on our defined strategy of investing, in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market capabilities as we ramp up the savings and efficiencies within our business. In the end, we continue to expect 2017 will be another year of sustainable profitable growth for The Kraft Heinz Company and another significant step forward in realizing our potential.","Thank you. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. A quick one and if you said this on the call I had a little trouble with some of the technology, I couldn't hear all of it so I apologize. But you talked in the past, I think, about maybe a little bit of a headwind early in the year from temporarily shifting some production as you closed some plants. I'm just trying to get a sense if this affected your gross margin at all in the period?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken. Hi, this is Paulo. So, I don't remember we mentioning it during the call, but in terms of the gross margin, which is pretty much flat year-over-year, it's kind of encouraging to us given the commodity headwind that we had this quarter comparing to the prior year's first quarter. And also the geographic mix that we have this year with the decline of the higher margin business in North America.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my follow-up is more generally there's been a lot of media stories lately about retail price \"wars\" right, people talking about Walmart and Amazon going to war with each other and pricing coming down and those customers of yours I guess \"asking\" companies like Kraft to help along with that process. I'm not seeing as much of that as maybe the media is making of it, but I'm curious if you can give your perspective on really what's happening in the \u2013 and I'm really talking U.S. retail environment right now. Are some of your customers, without naming any names, getting much more aggressive? Or is it more business as usual in terms of the pressures you're feeling in terms of pricing and so forth?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken. This is George. The price competition among retailers is not like something new. And, as you know, it becomes usually a major focus every time you see a new entrant or a new format in the market, which happens that we are seeing both now. Of course, we'd have to be mindful of the impact on us, particularly the one that we watch for the most is the equity, the impact on the equity of our brands, because we have certain expectation where we position our brands. So our approach to this will continue to be data-driven and discipline in deciding where and when to invest. So sometimes we go along and we make investments, some other times we go dark. At all times, however, we continue to be using a data-driven disciplined approach.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So in the wake of the Unilever proposal from a couple of months ago, we've heard concerns from some investors that your approach to reducing costs may cut into muscle and that in turn could make it harder for you to execute additional deals going forward. I guess the fear is that the board's a potential target. Companies wouldn't want their legacy to be signed to a company that could then somehow damage what they've been building up over the decades. And so in this matter I think perception could be more important than reality. It's probably not going to be enough simply to tell us that you don't cut too far. So in that context, do you agree that you may have an image problem with potential acquisition targets and what can you do to overcome that? And then I have a follow-up.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Alexia. Here's Bernardo. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, like you said, we need to separate what's perception and what are facts, right. And so if you think about our culture and what it's all about, it's actually quite simple and very consistent over decades. It's all about ownership, meritocracy, high performance, (28:11) brands, and dreaming big. It's all about those five things. And I truly believe those five things are applicable in many companies and many segments and so on. So through this culture we have, and so I don't think it will be more difficult or easier to do any other transaction.","About the perception, and again I think you pointed well, it's a little different story, right, because when people think about cost cutting and so on, we're much more in line to get efficient to fuel and invest behind profitable growth. That's what we really do, right. Our selling expenditure is going up, our working dollar is going up, our go-to-market capability are going up because those are things we believe for the long run can build profitable growth like we're here for.","So, in a sense, you may be right there is a perception problem or not. That's not for us to judge. What I can say that the values we have, those five things I just mentioned, we truly believe can be applicable in many companies and many segments.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much for that. And just as a really quick follow up. Can you quantify how much the timing shift of Easter affected your volumes this time?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Alexia. This is George here. So, look, we shared that with you at the last quarter that the Easter shift for us would be about 1% to 1.5%. However, we shipped, as stated earlier, around 40% of that in this quarter. So it wouldn't have the big impact. If you want to get an idea where the underlying performance for the quarter would have been, so if you take out all the one-offs or the calendar effects, consumption really for our category would have been trending at minus 1.2% to minus 1.5%. So I think that's a good starting point for you to look at as you move forward, and then you overlay the full impact of our 2017 programs, which will be realized in the second half of the year. So you will see sequential improvement as the year progresses.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about your negotiating kind of approach with retailers because I think you also mentioned that you lost some distribution in club stores in cheese and meat, and I wanted to know what were the circumstances for that. And tying in with what's happened in Canada, are you satisfied that you've got what you wanted in those negotiations with Canadian retailers? Did you have to hold off in order to maintain price? And was that the main objective, which eventually you got? Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Rob. It's Bernardo. In respect to Canada, I think it's a very fair question given our weak performance in the quarter, right. Yes, we are satisfied with the agreements we reached of which the five agreements were a top client that's about 80% of our sales in the beginning of March. And the fact that took us a little longer to achieve those agreements will affect. Especially the inventory and activities we had in January and February that's reflected in the results we are all seeing, right. Given what you're seeing now in April and May, we're already seeing the level of events and inventory coming back to normal and the planning looking at second half is a much stronger one. So we truly believe you're going to see sequentially better results as we move in the country.","Before moving to the U.S., I think it is important to say that we didn't believe at that time in January when we had agreements, we'll work in a win-win situation with our partners, the retailers, discussions about, between consumption and shipment, the level of profitability and price points in the market. All these make us pause and say, 'hey, it's better to delay a little bit the agreement, but get the right spot to have a win-win situation, what we believe we have moving forward. Again, it was not without pain like we're seeing the results I just describe it, but we are confident that the performance will be improving from now on. George, can you say to the U.S., please?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure. Sure. In the U.S. in Q1, look, we lost some distribution for certain retail items, namely when I speak about there is the cultured dairy, some cottage cheese and items and sour cream, and a little bit of natural slices that you could see in the Nielsen data. This is part of normal course of doing business. After a range review, you win some, you lose some. So for us, it's not a major one-off event.","However, what I wanted to say, in general, our view is the following: we will not sacrifice the long term for short-term gain. That we will not do. No way we will do that. It is but against our principles. And, as I said, we are driven by consumer insight translated into data that helps satisfy consumer needs and\/or retailers and the categories are better off. And that is the approach that we take as we have our discussions with our trade partners.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Excuse me. Good afternoon, everyone.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just two questions for me. First one, I guess a more broad one. One of the questions that I think we've certainly fielded more recently and even tonight is just company's at a point where the cost \u2013 I think the perception is the cost savings are close to fully identified and the revenues are declining and there's deleveraging, and it sort of underscores this notion that maybe the business \u2013 that the whole model is broken that it's not sustainable. So, Bernardo, can you sort of talk to that? How do you respond to that sort of theory?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan. Yes. Look, I strongly disagree with this statement. And you can see it, actually our model has been working for many, many, many years, decades and so. And if you look at the facts and data, you're going to see growing organic rates pretty much in line with average with our peers. But with the profitability level we have today allows us to invest strongly behind our brands and product quality.","So with that in mind, our strategy really continue to be focusing on creating profitable growth within the company to really four things: first, Big Bets innovation with bolder and stronger product development; second, achieving a higher share of voice with more working media dollars behind our brands; third, investing behind our go-to-market capabilities, touching the shelves in a much more structured way; and fourth, achieving the operational efficiencies, so we can support and invest behind growth. Those are the four things we have been doing since the merger and the things we will continue to build moving forward. So I strongly disagree with this statement.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for that. And I guess just as a follow-up, Paulo, can you remind us, in the first quarter last year, the tailwind from commodities, if I remember correctly, were like $75 million or $80 million benefit to EBITDA or EBITDA growth in the quarter, and this year I think it's actually a little bit of inflation. So can you just sort of remind us of what the benefit was and what the headwind is this quarter in terms of what that bridge was?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure. So if you think about \u2013 just let me step back to give more color on the main impacts we had in the quarter. So pretty much our North America EBITDA declined around $40 million, $45 million. The main impact we had was driven by volume mix. And this impact offset the savings initiatives around the $100 million that we have, additional savings, and the pricing we got in the quarter. So pretty much we had the commodity headwinds we faced this quarter being really responsible of the fact that the EBITDA decline. Prior year, in the same quarter, we had a much bigger favorability than that, almost twice this size if you go back to Q1 2016.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A question on cash flow. Your cash balance ended a lot lower than we thought this quarter. Looks like a lot of working capital leakage. Is this timing oriented? What exactly drove that?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","No. Yes. So, yes, you're right. I think the majority of the cash declines we had was pretty much driven by typical seasonal working capital. Q1 is a quarter that we normally lose a lot of working capital due to seasonality in that. And on top of that, we had inventory increase to prepare because we are preparing for all the footprint activities we are going to execute during the year. So the majority of this is just the timing and we expect to recover in the following quarters.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Good to hear. And then turning attention outside of the U.S., can you give us a sense of the magnitude of reinvestment in the Rest of the World? Because, jeez, the EBITDA decline on prior-year EBITDA declines for the Rest of the World and Europe combined from a headline perspective is discouraging to see.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","I think when I see that \u2013 just we start. We're still seeing that and we've said that before that we would have had investments in the Rest of the World business. The growth is coming and we expect the growth even to ramp up going forward. And I think to better answer the questions, we're still seeing the margin there is around 20% being representative of the margin that we're going to see in this unit going forward.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","And, Jason, just to add on the commercial side, like we said before, a lot of the growth are coming really from two venues, right? One is whitespace and so penetrating new categories and establish ourselves like cheese in the Middle East, cheese in Russia; Kraft sauces in Europe, Australia, New Zealand; the nuts business in China and U.K.; Mac & Cheese in Latin America and UK. So you have the core \u2013 and not only the whitespace, you have also the core that's pretty much the beans and soup in New Zealand and Australia, and condiments and sauces almost everywhere. It's still growing strongly on the Rest of the World. So we will continue to see us investing behind and supporting this growth. So, looking at that, it's very in line what you have been saying we will be doing for the rest of the year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good evening. I just had...","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Two questions for you as well. First off would just be you've outlined some areas of reinvestment for the business in 2017. I saw it noted for the Rest of the World. I just want to get a sense of how those phase through the year. And then will that spread across to the other divisions as well? Or is Rest of the World where most of that quote-unquote reinvestment is occurring?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. So it's pretty much what I was saying. So we expect these investments happening in the first half of the year in Rest of the World. And we expect this pay off and start seeing better margins going back to the normal margins of the business in the second half of the year.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","That's the second stage in that we're seeing those investments.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then again, to be clear, mostly that's all in Rest of the World, right?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just a second question for you. You've talked before about your global brands and the focus on your global brands. And I know certainly you had a weaker sales performance in the U.S. so that certainly would have affected their performance. But do those global brands gain share or can you give any kind of sort of metrics around how those brands performed in the quarter?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Chris. That's very much in line with what we said about the restructure plan to create the three global brands and platforms right behind Kraft, Heinz and Planters. It's too early stage, but I think in most part of the countries, we wanted to penetrate on 2017. We already created supply chain and that's exactly the whitespace I was talking about early on when you talk about we're starting to penetrate on cheese, we're starting to grow on nuts, UK, China, and now going to Continental Europe, Mac & Cheese in Brazil and UK and so on. So those brands are growing in line with our expectations for the year and it's starting to accelerate as much as we can. That being said, given the size of the business, and so on, the magnitude they have is still not significant, for example, to offset our performance we had in the United States and Canada.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess, first one would be the bid for Unilever was interesting on many levels, but maybe no more so than it was considered sort of a growthier asset than some of the others than you've done, given the emerging market exposure, the household and personal care exposure and such. So, I guess, more generally, my question really is when you think about synergies of a transaction, can they be enough almost at any level, I guess, to fully compensate maybe for a set of brands or assets that maybe might be in more of a structural decline? In other words, how do you balance those two: the synergy capture versus maybe long-term structural decline in a set of brands?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. This is Paulo. So, to think about \u2013 the way that we think about our M&A framework, which hasn't changed since the beginning, and the framework is pretty much that we want to own brands that we'd be happy owning these brands for the long run, brands with strong equity, strong relative market share, brands that can travel. But we also analyze a lot how the business operates, the go-to-market of the business, and more important than that, how the business operates better, how they would operate better, how they grow fast being together. Okay? And, of course, doing this analysis, we take everything into consideration, including all the synergies that we have, all the options that we have in terms of getting a better performance. And, again, everything that you said is always to improve our portfolio, right, when we have this type of framework.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","And more important and also very important is that we're always going to be very, very disciplined on price.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Thank you for that. And then I think you mentioned cost savings incremental of about $100 million in the quarter. Am I correct in assuming pretty much all of that is carry-over saves from last year? And I know you've said truly incremental cost saves are more back-half loaded this year. So, I guess, my question is, were there any incremental cost saves this quarter and\/or how do you expect the truly new incremental cost saves to ramp throughout the year? Is it primarily second half versus first half?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. So, it's Paulo again. So when we're entering the second year of integration, it's much better to track for cumulative savings than trying to track a run-rate, given the structure of our savings that is net of inflation and net of investment. So we ended the prior year at $1.2 billion cumulative savings. We are ending this first quarter at $1.2 billion level and we said that and we're still in the path to get to $1.7 billion. So, out of the $500 million that we expect to deliver this year additional, we delivered $100 million in the first quarter. And again, we still have $400 million to deliver going forward in the next three quarters. And again, you're right that we said that we expect additional savings \u2013 the majority of the savings to be in the second half.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks very much. I guess, a big picture question. I know you've answered a lot of questions about the model existentially. As you look back over the past six months, are there any particular costs you could identify that you've reduced in the dramatic cost reductions you've made that had a meaningful impact this quarter that if you had it to do over again, you wouldn't have done? That'd be my first question. And, I guess, my second question would be what are you seeing in developing markets, Rest of World right now that makes you want to accelerate your investment behind those particular businesses that you mentioned earlier? Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Jon. The answer to your first question is, quite frankly, no. The places we wanted to see increase cost that was selling and marketing, we did. Sometimes we ask ourselves on the things that have been working, and George talked about like the renovation of the Mac & Cheese, the hot dog campaign we're starting now in the United States, the Philadelphia Cheesecake, the Heinz Seriously Good in Europe, and the Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in Brazil and Australia, Planters in China, Planters in Russia. If we should not have grown even more. That's something we ask.","But that being said, there was absolutely no efficiencies or something that took over the capacities of the company to generate what, the things I said before, to focus on Big Bets, to focus on go-to market capability, to grow our share of voice behind our brands, and so on. So it's a no.","On the second part of your question about why we believe we can accelerate the growth on the Rest of the World, because we still want to penetrate in most parts of those markets, right, we see outside of the business in countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Indonesia, even developed countries like Japan, and so it's still \u2013 we can't be much bigger through our core categories that you already operate in whitespace, as I mentioned. So we are confident in our capacity through the global brands and the local juries (50:58) we have to generate profitable growth.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Two questions. The first one is regarding divestitures. When I look at your cousins at Anheuser-Busch, they've divested assets worth almost $30 billion from the SABMiller transaction. I realize that in their case they started with a lot more leverage, you don't have necessarily that pressure. But the complexity that you have inherited from all these two transactions would make you think that you would want to be more focused a little bit and exit some categories. I mean, you have this baby food business in Italy, for example, and I could mention a host of other products. So just give us a sense of what should we expect? And what is the reason why you haven't tried to focus your portfolio more? You would think that that would help in terms of your ability to ramp up the cost savings target. That's the first question.","And the second one is more just going back to Unilever. The way I would like to ask the question is when you acquired Kraft Foods Group, you said that you were building a global food and beverage powerhouse. But now that apparently was going to include soap and shampoos. So do you want to update us in terms of what your vision is? I mean, should we assume that someday you could own a tobacco company, a restaurant, or something else? What can you comment on that, please? Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","So hi, Pablo. This is Paulo. So, on the first question \u2013 and let me start from there. So, the first question was about...","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","The divestitures.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. So according to divestiture of the brands, today we feel comfortable with the brands and the capital that you operate. We think we have scale and we operate well there. Again, as soon as if we decide to divest any categories or any brand in any specific geography, we will communicate this properly to the market.","So related to the Unilever potential transaction, we really believe that as I said in the M&A framework it's kind of \u2013 again, if you go back here in terms of only consumer brands, brands with a strong market share, brands that can travel, similar go-to-market, similar operation, I think at the end of the day that these two segments of the consumer product goods are very similar and that's the reason why you see also many companies operating brands for consumers, sometimes food, sometimes personal care, sometimes healthcare.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. Thank you. And just if I can squeeze one follow-up. So also in this idea of complexity, at the moment, you have center of the aisle categories, you have refrigerated categories obviously with cheese and hams, you don't have much snacks. But can you talk about in terms of the many parts of the supermarket that you're in, I guess, you're trying to be in everything and at the same time, it's not just warehouse delivery, but it could DSD. Or is there a certain \u2013 or should we assume that structurally within the supermarket, you still want to be mostly center of the aisle and refrigerated is more ancillary because you inherited because of the Kraft deal? Thanks.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Pablo, this is George here. Just to confirm a few things, one, our entire model is DC. So we do not have any DSD in the United States. However, we've taken a very large number of categories. Including categories in the fresh aisle, we have a business. I don't know if you're aware, but we sell in the deli specialty cheeses and under the Churny Company we have some very good business there. We sell in the dairy refrigerated aisle as well as deli both in processed meat as well as the center of store and in the snack aisle under Planters. We feel very good about our portfolio and we allocated portfolio role to each category and brand as part of our long-term strategic plan.","So while we have a diversified number of categories and brands, we do not treat them all the same. We have a different role and that role would dictate the level of investment, the new product introduction, and the support that we give to these brands. And that we see as a competitive advantage to be able to utilize in the marketplace.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","If we could take one more question, that would be great.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, everyone. If I could just squeeze in two as well. The first, some of the renovation you talked about in certain areas of the business like Oscar Mayer increasingly now seems like a necessity for bringing momentum back to those categories and responding to consumer shifts. So can you talk about the feasibility of doing that in a cost neutral way in the early stages? Or is it going to take some additional levers like managing price pack architecture or making upfront investments until you get the benefit of strong volume leverage to make that a margin neutral proposition?","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Okay.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, Matt. This is George here. It's a very good question. As a matter of fact, we like the renovation a lot more than innovation because the payback is a lot faster; in some areas, it's almost immediate. And you mentioned some of the good ones like Oscar Mayer. And Oscar Mayer, as you know, about 18 months ago, we started transforming part of the range to Oscar Mayer Natural. That's approaching about $100 million business now, and it will be a lot larger. We did similar things in Mac & Cheese last year when we removed artificial ingredients from Mac & Cheese, and we're very, very happy with the performance, we're growing share in the Mac & Cheese category at the back of renovation and innovation.","Couple years ago, we did that on Philadelphia and you see our share and our growth there, similarly when we did that on Kraft Singles, we're still growing share on Kraft Singles. In all of them, we actually catered our campaign and our communication to reflect that. So while we did not change our communication strategy, we had very, very good growth rate both in term of absolute and market share and faster payback on all those things.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, George. And then if I could ask you one follow-up as well. Just coming back to the update you provided on the U.S. You highlighted an expectation of better execution in the second quarter. Is that just sort of related function of having a fuller merchandising calendar? Or are there specific execution issues or tactical actions you wish you had sort of acted otherwise on during Q1 that you would see shifting going forward?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah Good questions, both actually. One, there is a natural shift in the merchandising calendar. One of them is Easter, and the second one, we introduced a scale program that I talked about in my remarks. So that is new or incremental to what we did in prior years. So that is as far as the promotional calendar is concerned.","And the third one, we restricted ourselves from promoting Oscar Mayer and meats for quite some time and while we were going through our footprint project. That restriction has been lifted now and we are in full support of the brand. So you're going to see good improvement in both the cold cuts areas and other parts of the meat segment. So the combination of both is going to improve the trends that you see in the market. As a matter of fact, if you look at the very recent trend, they're very different from January and February \u2013 much, much improved.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, again.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Jakubik for any closing comments.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, everybody, for joining us this evening.

My name is Joelle, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kraft Heinz Company's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher Jakubik","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our business update. We'll begin today's call with an overview of our third quarter and 9-month results as well as an update on our path forward from Miguel Patricio, our CEO; and Paulo Basilio, our CFO, and then we'll open the lines for your questions. Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release. ","Now let's turn to Slide 3, and I'll hand it over to Miguel.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you, Chris, and hello, everyone. On our previous call, I promised to be candid with you from the start and to update you on our progress along the way. I also highlighted some potential risks to the second half performance. 3 months on, and we are getting to deeply understand our business. That business is on a better footing because we are increasing visibility and control of our costs. The team is making excellent progress and we are gaining confidence in our path forward. We are not where we believe we can be, but we are excited with the evolution we had in the third quarter and what we have ahead of us. This comes from directing our efforts to 3 work streams: stabilizing the business as we execute to the 2019 plan; setting our near-term transformation in motion; and establishing a true north through our enterprise strategy work. As we committed to you earlier, we will give you a detailed plan coming out of the enterprise strategy work early next year. But we do want to share the progress we have made and set early high-level observations with you today. ","In terms of delivering our 2019 plan and how we are running the business day-to-day our performance improved from the first half of the year, and we are seeing signs of continuous improvement taking hold. As I said on our last call, my #1 focus is our people and developing the team because it's our people that will deliver continuous improvement and the turnaround of Kraft Heinz. Since our last call, we have made a number of moves to enhance our leadership team, both at the global level and within business units. For instance, I named Nina Barton to a new role, Chief Growth Officer, where in addition to leading the development of our enterprise strategy, Nina has responsibility for overall channel growth, global e-commerce and digital, innovation, marketing services and R&D.","In Finance, our need is to move with speed and have in place proven well-respected leaders that know the business from the start. With that, I'm delighted to have Paulo Basilio back to the position of Global CFO and also Andre Maciel to be our Head of the U.S. Finance, a job he held for the first few years following the merger. To build morale and ensure a high level of engagement, I have held 9 town halls and put out roughly 20 internal videos to shine a spotlight of activities that employees across the world, across Heinz, are doing to address the company. In this past month, we held a global Kraft Heinz Meal Packathon where employees from 15 locations across 9 countries got together with Rise Against Hunger to pack 1 million meals for children in need. Not only we reached the target, but we overdelivered by packing more than 1.2 million meals. And although we have still a lot to do to build our bench strength, in terms of recruiting, I'm very encouraged by the number of people we've seen that want to be part of our turnaround. ","Results-wise, organic net sales growth was up slightly on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA was down roughly 4.5% in Q3 on a constant currency basis versus 16% in the first half. Pricing is coming through and inflecting from negative to positive in both United States and EMEA, with overall elasticity in line with our expectations. Net inflation in our supply chain costs falling from 3.3% in the first half of the year to below 1% in the third quarter, marking the first quarter since 2017 that we have been seeing stability on the cost side. And we began to lap stepped-up marketing and e-commerce spending and investments in sales and customer service from the previous year. In addition, we are seeing significant positive momentum where we have something to say, and this includes mid-single-digit retail takeaway in our U.S. condiments and sauces, cream cheese, snacks, desserts and seasonal franchise. In ketchup, specifically, we are getting great traction around the world behind our Heinz 150th anniversary, including our first-ever global Heinz campaign featuring pop music star, Ed Sheeran. And our total U.S. sauces business, which includes ketchup, mustard, mayo, Miracle Whip, salad dressings and pasta sauce, has continued to build momentum since 2017.","Brazil is growing double digits in both retail and foodservice channels, and we are seeing solid growth of 14% in our China soy sauce business. ","At the same time, we are still far from where we should be. While overall performance is improving, our numbers are still negative versus the prior year, and our performance remains uneven across categories and across geographies. This includes ongoing share and distribution losses within our natural cheese, cold cuts and coffee business in the United States, lower-than-anticipated promotional lifts in Canada, ongoing infant nutrition declines in both EMEA and China as well as increasing supply chain costs in our Rest of the World segment. ","To change our trajectory, we must improve our execution around the category, brand and sales initiatives by making critical fixes and closing any capability gaps; and drive greater efficiency in our supply chain across procurement, manufacturing and distribution. So while we have been working hard to finish the year in a much better place than we started, we have also been investing a lot of energy in our future. We are developing 9 transformational projects that touch the core areas of our company to improve our capabilities and make us a more efficient company. Our teams are making rapid progress understanding root causes, defining what needs to be done and already taking some actions that will benefit 2020. ","The nine projects currently underway includes 5 projects focused on top line, 2 projects focused on operational efficiencies and 2 projects focused on organizational effectiveness.","Slide 10 shows our list of projects and the scope of each, but let me provide some examples to illustrate. In marketing, we are defining the framework and optimal marketing spend, both by brand and by working\/nonworking allocations. And so far, we identified the opportunity to reallocate a substantial amount of dollars to work in [indiscernible] 2020 as well as redirect dollars disproportionately towards support of our flagship brands. Based on this alone, we will see a significant percentage increase in media spend and an even greater increase for the brands that are the biggest drivers of our profitability. Around our innovation efforts, we are revamping our product development process so we can be faster and more consumer-centric with our new products. And we are evaluating shifting innovation support to fewer, bigger, better initiatives, launches that promise to be more incremental to our base. As a result, in 2020, we will reduce the number of projects being launched by half and better align our post-2020 pipeline with our enterprise strategy. ","In sales, the work is concentrated in 3 areas. First, strengthening day-to-day execution through ways of working and timing of our planning process to tighten the connectivity between sales, our category teams, and more importantly, with our retail partners. Second is developing a road map for price, mix, promotion and trade improvements. And third is developing a channel strategy, to better define roles and priorities for each part of the portfolio, by channel and by customer. In supply chain, we have several projects underway that collectively can deliver significant efficiencies to help offset inflation with the goal of funding our long-term strategy. A key driver of this will be examining every SKU, cutting anything with a negative margin, and in the process, removing complexity from the system to boost productivity and improve mix. Based on our work to date, we see scope to rationalize a significant portion of the SKUs in our U.S. business and with minimal impact on profits. There is also more work being done elsewhere, including the transformation of our financial planning and forecasting that Paulo is heading up. ","Taking a step back, I think it's important to recognize here that even though we are putting things in motion now, the purpose of all these projects is to lay a foundation that will support us for the long run. ","Finally, regarding the long term, in the third quarter, we initiated and we are on track with the development of our enterprise strategy. We are developing a much better understanding of the consumer with a view to the future. We are setting our strategic direction, where we believe we can drive the greatest growth and returns by brand, by category, by geography and by channel with the full support and participation of our Board. And we are assessing how best to organize ourselves against our biggest opportunities. There is still much work ahead of us, but we remain confident in our ability to launch our enterprise strategy and share it in detail with you early next year. Personally, I'm encouraged and excited at how our people are embracing change, their desire to get better through new ways of doing things and to move with speed. After all, these are the key ingredients to building a continuous improvement mindset. And as I said on the last call, one of our key principles and goals for the company going forward is not only to identify the new investments needed to grow both the top line and the bottom line, but keeping expenses under control and using that capital to support those investments.","With that, I will turn over to Paulo to discuss where we are and where we expect to go from here on the financial front.","Paulo Basilio","Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a quick overview of our third quarter performance, which showed both sequential improvement versus the first half as well as the beginning of business stabilization. Our top line improved versus the first half, with organic net sales down 1.1%. Pricing turned from negative in the first half to positive in the quarter. This was driven by realization of the pricing actions we announced in the first part of the year in the United States and EMEA as well as ongoing pricing to offset inflation in Latin America. Vol\/mix was lower versus the prior year as we are lapping the strong gains in the prior year and continue to see unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year. In Q3, retail inventory change resulted in a negative 110 basis point impact to U.S. vol\/mix. That translated into a roughly 80 basis point decline versus the prior year for total Kraft Heinz results. And for the fourth quarter, I will note here that we currently expect a roughly 50 basis point headwind from lower retail inventory levels for our U.S. business. ","With respect to profitability, EBITDA is beginning to stabilize. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was down 4.6% versus the prior year. And this includes a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from divestitures. Excluding these factors, the reduction in EBITDA was driven by a mix of negatives and positives. On the positive side, we are getting supply chain costs under control in the U.S. EMEA returned to EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis. And we had favorable timing of marketing and selling expenses in the U.S. versus the prior year. At the same time, supply chain costs were still negative year-on-year on a global basis in Q3, driven by higher supply chain losses in the Rest of the World markets. A combination of lower pricing and higher input costs led to another weak performance versus the prior year in Canada, and both of these need to be fixed going forward. ","Finally, at adjusted EPS, Q3 results were better than we anticipated 3 months ago. This is mainly due to a combination of a better-than-expected outcome in other income and expenses due to favorable FX gains, favorable order income that we do not expect to repeat, lower-than-expected interest expense as a result of successful refinancing as well as more favorable discrete items in the tax line. With respect to our effective tax rate, we are now expecting a rate in between 19% and 20% for the full year versus the 21% expected previously, which brings me to our financial outlook and near-term expectations. ","On a personal note, it was an honor when Miguel and the Board asked me to step back into the CFO role here at Kraft Heinz. Much has changed since I last held it. As Miguel has been saying, this period calls for new thinking and new ways of doing business. One area that I believe must be of greater focus is the company trajectory in gross profit. As mentioned, we are revisiting the efficiency in many areas of our supply chain, the effectiveness of our programming, our profitability at an SKU level, as well as product mix to create a better port sales. In the process, the elimination of ink to volume made paper organic net sales in the near term. In addition, key commodity inflation and price volatility in both cheese and meats is likely to remain a challenge in both Q4 and into next year. While we are implementing pricing in both these areas, reaction in the market remains unclear at this point. So as always, we will need to balance market share, distribution and profitability. ","And finally, please note that the divestitures we closed earlier this year will and unfavorable currency may continue to temper our reported results in the near term. At EBITDA, we are focused on continuous improvement with the goal of stabilizing constant currency adjusted EBITDA, excluding divestitures on a year-on-year basis. As mentioned, our visibility on net inflation within our supply chain is improving. We also have significant scope to drive the business forward through greater investments in media that we are determined to make happen. So far, we have been encouraged by our ability to find and fund efficiencies to help offset inflation and to help fund those investments in [indiscernible]. That said, we are still defining our interest price strategy and finalizing our broader ambition to see if more will be needed. ","So far as guidance goes, we continue to think it would not be productive for the organization to provide specific point-estimate financial guidance. I will tell you, however, in recognizing that we are still at early stages, it would be prudent to expect year-on-year top and bottom line performance in Q4 to be generally similar to what we saw in Q3. And from an earnings per share perspective, while we have delivered better-than-expected income and expenses below adjusted EBITDA, we still expect these items to be unfavorable on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter. Collectively, we expect these below-the-line items to negatively impact EPS by up to $0.10 versus the prior year in Q4. ","Now before we move to Q&A, there is another area I think is important to address in terms of progress to date, where we currently stand and where we go from here, and that is our capital structure. Here, we have been making significant progress against our balance sheet priorities, and we believe they have strong credit momentum to build on. From the merger to the end of 2018, we diligently reduced gross debt by $2.4 billion. In Q3, we announced an additional $2.3 billion of cash-funded debt take-out that was enabled by a combination of divestiture proceeds and solid cash generation. And along the way, we have taken a number of actions to put our patience in an overfunded stock and have prefunded most of our post-retirement benefit obligations. As a result, we have minimum future contribution requirements going forward. Also in Q3, we undertook a successful leverage near to $3 billion refinance that further strengths our liquidity. We have a strong investor participation in our offering that we think reinforced investor confidence. And this refinance gives us significant flexibility through 2025, especially given the fact that we currently have no commercial paper outstanding and a $4 billion revolving credit facility that has never been drawn. Refinancing our debt as well as establishing our long-term strategy are critical steps to defining how we will continue to deleverage our company and maintain our investment-grade status.","Now we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein Research.","Alexia Howard","So obviously, this was a pretty encouraging quarter relative to the first half of the year. Investors that I speak to are very keen to know about what the path forward is to stabilization. We don't need to worry about 2020 at this point. But as you look out to the fourth quarter, I think Paulo alluded to this, are you expecting to see a similar pattern to what we saw this quarter in terms of broadly stable or maybe slightly down top line and something broadly in line with the fairly modest declines in EBITDA that you saw this time around?","Paulo Basilio","Alexa, thanks for the question. This is Paulo. So as we're sitting here, as well, when we see our Q4 results, we expect very similar year-over-year performance versus -- as we saw in Q3 versus prior year, both in sales and EBITDA. And this is pretty much driven by, we have divestitures, FX, higher commodity costs that we expect in Q4, and we'll be lapping a strong vol\/mix comp, mainly in U.S. And in the positive side, we're going to have all the results from the price actions that we're taking. And the best -- better visibility in cost and net inflation. So we are expecting pretty much in sales and EBITDA similar year-over-year performance as we saw in Q3. And below the line, we are expecting roughly $0.10 -- up to $0.10 headwind versus prior year. So pretty much that's how we're seeing Q4 performing in this year.","Alexia Howard","Fantastic. And given the comments on the uses of cash and the leverage and the investment-grade rating that you made at the end of the prepared remarks, should we assume that, at least for the time being, there are no plans to cut the dividend? Or is that something that we'll have to wait for the Investor Day early in 2020 to get confirmed?","Paulo Basilio","So Alexa, first of all, I think investment-grade status for us is -- continues to be very important. We've just declared the dividend, as you saw. And again, we are in a very solid position in terms of liquidity after the recent refi we did and also in the cash flow generation that would allow us to reduce our leverage over time. But now we are going to a very deep strategic review of the business, understanding how we're going to see the future performance of the company. And in this analysis, in this review, a capital structure is going to be a very important chapter. So we expect to come back to the market with our full view and full picture of how we're expecting the company's performance, the company's strategy for the future, including capital structure at the beginning of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Miguel, you discussed a little bit about your desire or the plan to move the organization more in the direction of a continuous improvement, productivity sort of mindset from what I think you described as more integration-led cost-savings programs that we all kind of know proves less sustainable. I realize you're probably not in a position yet to fully size this sort of opportunity. But I guess, do you see any structural reason that would preclude KHC from driving similar levels of sort of ongoing productivity as peers, let's say, as a percent of cost of goods. And the reason I ask is because I presume this is where it can be quite helpful in terms of funding the media spend investment that you mentioned today on the call, other things, inflation and such that come up all in the context of managing EBITDA to be more stable within the confines, I guess, of a constrained balance sheet. So perhaps, any color on that you can provide would be helpful.","Miguel Patricio","Andrew, thank you very much for your question and I think we think alike. From day 1, when I looked at the past and I saw that there was a pretty big deterioration of gross profit because of decrease of COGS, we made -- we defined supply as a big area for improvement for 2 reasons. First, because we had pretty big disruptions in the past with our customers for -- because of low service levels. But second, because COGS has been increasing in our company. And I do not see a reason for that. I think that if we changed the mentality to the company for a mentality of continuous improvement, if we invest on that, on people, in our factories, in our way of thinking on believing if we change the mentality from basically cost-cutting into continuous improvement, I think we can do it and we should do it. And as you said, I see it as a great source of -- for investment in the business. I was very glad to see that in this quarter we could stabilize cost of goods sold. And this is big for us. We are all relieved with that. It's just the first step. Everything to be proved, but the first step was good and gives us a lot of faith, a lot of hope that we are in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","You mentioned -- Miguel, you mentioned in your remarks, capability gaps. And I thought that was an interesting way of putting it. Could you be more specific about the kind of capabilities where you see gaps that need to be funded? Like is it something different than we all think about media spend, we think about product quality, as things that pay off right now? Are there big structural investments as far as generating insights where you feel like there are gaps that require investment? If so, like, where specifically? And maybe related to that, the SKU reduction, is there anything related to like new insights, new capabilities that, that would now would be the time to look at reducing SKUs in North America? It seems to me like -- I don't know, that seems to be something where I think Kraft Heinz has been great at taking a look at where SKUs don't make sense and focusing. So what -- maybe what insights related to that drove that decision?","Miguel Patricio","Thank you, Jonathan. Specifically, let me start specifically with the SKUs that you are mentioning, and then I go -- I'll tell you overall my point of view about that. I think we -- the company has been on a frenzy of innovation in the last 2 to 3 years and trying through launching new products to compensate the decline in net sales. We have not been successful on that. We really have not been successful on that. Yes, we brought a lot of complexity to the system but this innovation was not translated into additional sales. It was very cannibalistic and brought much more complexity. And as a consequence, a lot of supply chain losses and lower margins. Many of this innovation was done through third-party manufacturers. So of course, that's, for me, when I arrived and with fresh eyes, I asked the obvious questions and one of them is, let me understand profitability by SKU, let me understand volume by SKU, and there's a big tail of SKUs that, yes, actually, with a negative margin or are not important at all, very, very small or both. And that can just generate a lot of complexity in the system. And so yes, we are going to reduce this, we are going to reduce. ","We have to have the discipline that, at the same time that we innovate and we put new products in the market we have to have the discipline to clean the tail of low margin, negative margin or a low volume, very low volume, that are really not [indiscernible] just creating more complexity in the system. And this is a capability. So going back to your point about capabilities. I think that innovation is an area that we have to increase, we'll have to improve dramatically. There are other areas that I think that we have to improve our capabilities. And -- but I think that innovation is one that I'm very focused on. It is a big driver for growth for the future, has to be especially in the food industry, but we have to do bigger innovation. We have to do fewer innovation. We have to do bolder innovation. We have to do profitable innovation and has to be incremental instead of doing everything and old products innovating and vouching and throwing new products in the market that will not really generate extra profitability to our company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","A couple of questions. One is, Miguel, on the slides, you focused a lot on giving us a plan for 2020 but I kind of thought that investors were looking for like a 3-year plan or something of a longer-term nature. Are you going to give us kind of a ramp of what those next 3 years might look like when you give us the review?","And then secondly, a more detailed question. In your conversations with customers, have you found that customers are giving you any kind of insight on their perception of Kraft versus your peers? My perception is that Kraft has had some pretty rigid structures in terms of pay-for-performance with customers, and maybe that led to some of the disputes that you've had in the past. Is there any insight you can give us in that regard?","Miguel Patricio","Yes. So two very different questions. Let me answer first the first one, Robert. I'm working at the same time in the -- well, in delivering the results for 2019 on building the budget for '20 and on the future, right? For 2020, I need the strategy, but this -- 2020 is going to be more about continued stabilization. And then this is what I aim, is that 2020 is a year that we stabilize the business and that we build the foundation for growth in 2021. So the answer to you is yes, when we present the strategy that we are working on, that is going to be a long term with a long-term view. So we -- our 3-year plan will be addressed. Regarding customers, yes, I've been talking to customers and learning a lot from them. And I can tell you that their biggest concern is what you call the disputes and then that translates into service levels. So we had problems in the past, several problems in different types of products with our service level. And that although we haven't had any big problem this year, so we are in a much better year in terms of service level, there are still scars from the past. ","And then when they remind us of all the problems that we had in the previous years in terms of service level, they questioned that if this is sustainable or not. They also -- so this, I would say, that is -- their number one concern, really, service level. But they're also concerned about planning and strategy. So we need to be better on our planning with them and adapt our planning cycle to their planning cycle. I think there's a big opportunity to do that, and we are going to address that. At this moment, because of the way we are planned -- that we plan on our budget cycle that doesn't tie with their budget cycle, the feeling I have is that we are always late and the feeling that they have is the same. The other part is related to strategy that they want to see us communicating to them and teaching them and is training them in a more strategic way on a long term. And then I would put a fourth point that the -- that is about execution, that we can have better execution in their stores. So I would say that these are the four items that we -- that I'm -- when I think about customers that I'm focused on, really, service level, planning, strategy and execution.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","So I think about the follow-up on Andrew's question about -- so, I guess, supply chain opportunities or opportunities within COGS and maybe, Paulo, if you could help us sort of get a little bit of a bridge. If we go back to EBITDA for fiscal '17 and then compare it to where we are the last 12 months, there's an EBITDA decline of about $1.6 billion or so. And can you give us a little -- a bridge of kind of what the drivers were that got us from there to here? And I guess what's really underneath the question is just trying to understand how much of it was items that were outside of the company's control and then items that are sort of within the control and are potentially addressable?","Paulo Basilio","Sure. So thanks for the question. When you go back from our peak 2017 margins. And again, when you bridge these two, let's say, our last 12, as I said, pretty much we have two big drivers, two big areas of decline, right? 60% of the decline roughly is coming from gross margin. And this -- you could split this in mainly the inflation we have in our supply chain with not enough initiatives to offset that; investments that we had in service level for the customers; an unfavorable product mix that we saw in the launch of the business, and this is part of the type of incrementality, the innovation that we had that Miguel was talking about. And also, the fact that with all of this inflation and not enough savings or efficiency initiatives to offset that, we were slow in moving our prices. So I think this is pretty much 60% of the gap. The other 30% of the gap is driven by SG&A. So 60-plus around gross margin, 25% to 30% around SG&A. 70% of that was pretty much commercial investments we made. We had international go-to-market initiatives, new areas inside the company like digital and also additional market investments that we put that is -- because of our fragmentation of innovation, ended up going too much to nonworking piece to support the innovation pipeline.","And the remaining, also we have like of 30% of the 25% from the SG&A is pretty much lapping bonds accrual that we didn't have in 2017. So a 6% gross margin, 30% SG&A, with 70% of this 30% coming from these commercial investments that we made that we are assessing now. The other 30% of the 25% decline, driven by bonds that we didn't have in 2017. I think it's -- on that, I think it's -- and we, internally here, and myself specifically, we reflect a lot about this, the performance and the root cause of this performance. And we had big leaks of key learnings here and things that we're going to go after and things that came from the outside. That's pretty much at the base of all these initiatives, near-term projects that we have. But at the end of the day, pretty much we were not kind of fast enough to move from that first initial integration stage to build this organic growth plan for the company. In a moment that the industry had a lot of big transformations, right, both from the customers' lens, from the retailers' lens. ","So I think that was the combination of the things that I think drove our past three years' performance down. But now I think the offense is that we built these work streams with Miguel to address those things through -- again, we had a lot of costs inside the business. And now we are reassessing each of them the ability for us to get back them to be able to help to fund all the investments that we are identifying as opportunities in the business. And what we can share also here is that so far, we found a lot of opportunities to invest, as Miguel was saying, behind media, behind higher support from a more concentrated set of innovation. And so far, we were able to find the sources inside the company to fund those investments. Again, of course, we are still working on the strategy and later price, that we expect to find more areas of opportunity and also more areas of savings to support potentially those investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","Miguel, I'd like to come back to the innovation approach. Because when you speak to the fewer, bigger, better ideas, I'm curious as to how you think about the capabilities there. Because those are, as you say, bets which may or may not work out. So can you speak to where the company stands right now and its ability to identify the idea that could become successful, big bets, because the company has pursued this for the last couple of years of very limited success. And I guess my follow-up would be, what's changing or what still needs to change in terms of the capacity there?","Miguel Patricio","Okay. So a very good question. And I'll tell you, I think that there's a fundamental change that -- or we need to do a fundamental change in the company, from a company that was much more focused on today and probably pursuing a strategy that was more focused on inorganic growth to a company that needs to pursue organic growth and needs to understand the future better than anybody else. That's a big change. You need to change, you need to put first the mindset in a direction.","Second, really a strategy, where do we think that the growth is going to happen? So we need to transform this company into a much more consumer-driven company in a much more looking-forward type of company rather than just operating the present. It's not either one or the other. We need to do both. And I think that we can and we should do both. So as a consequence, I think that the innovation was we did a lot of plan extensions. We were relying too much on things that were not really incremental and we need to do more things in areas that we believe are going to grow. The last call, I gave the example of Boca, and I think is a good example. We were the first company introducing veggie burgers 15 years ago. But because we didn't have a good vision about how the world would progress, Boca has not been a focused brand. And as a consequence, we never really took advantage of everything that is happening in this area. ","So understanding the future, understanding the consumer, I think, is the way to go. Of course that -- for that, we will need much more better insight, much better creativity. We'll need a more united R&D. So we didn't have a Head of R&D. R&D was in all departments of the company. We are now unifying R&D in the company, having one head of R&D. We are defining our strategy. We also appointed a Chief Growth Officer. Pull things into this direction, right. Hopefully, I was -- I gave you the answer you were expecting, John. I don't know if you want to ask anything else related to that.","John Baumgartner","No, No. I guess, maybe just as a follow-up in terms of rebuilding the R&D pipeline. How long does it take to really kind of get the ideas going, kind of getting the pipeline full again? Is this like a five year plan? Is it a three year plan, how do you think about that?","Miguel Patricio","So on that, we also have to work on process to speed up innovation. In my previous world, in my previous role and previous company, we reduced the development of products from a 2-year to 6 months by changing process methodologies, basically introducing the agile type of building innovation. We're going to do the same here. So we need to be much faster. And that is also what I previously said, John, that in 2020, needs to be a year of stabilization to give us the time to be working on the pipeline for the future, for the years to come. What we have in the pipeline for 2020, it's still, of course, not under the strategy that we are going to present to you at the beginning of the year. During 2020, we will have to define and develop the pipeline for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Miguel, I have a quick follow-up to Alexia's question, and I appreciate you haven't fully ironed out the Board plan at this point in time. But can you help investors at least think through the obvious and, more importantly, the less obvious implications of the dividend policy as you think forward? That would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Miguel Patricio","Can you help me giving you exactly what you have in mind, Steve? I want to address your question in the right way.","Steven Strycula","Sure. Yes. So when I have conversations with investors, we receive the puts and takes of whether the company has excess capital to really pay out at the levels that they do today. And how do you think about some of the considerations of, if you have fewer brands in the portfolio moving forward, or the priority is to paying down debt? So to sum up, the question would really be, what are the very obvious considerations of keeping it versus not keeping it? And then what would be some of the unintended consequences that maybe most investors might not see from our vantage point?","Paulo Basilio","This is Paulo. Let me try to address how we're thinking about that. So in the cash flow information, and I know that we're going to see these later in our Q. In -- for example, in Q3, we generated a free cash flow to equity after CapEx of $860 million. So sufficient to pay the dividend at roughly below $500 million. But the important thing here is that now, what we are doing that, as Miguel mentioned, we are discussing the future of the company, the strategy of the company, how we're going to, where are we going to invest to grow the business for the next 3 to 5 years. And developing this plan, for sure, as you can imagine, like capital structure is a key chapter of this as I said. And for us, being an investment-grade company is -- remains very, very important. So our time line here is that we are going to develop our strategic plan, we are going to set our future expectations for our performance, addressing our portfolio, our categories, our brands, our regions and also our capital structure to support that and share with the market early next year.","Miguel Patricio","Steven, just repeating what Paulo said. I think that when we define our strategy, we'll define what are the areas that we think that we can have substantial growth. What are the areas that we don't think we can have substantial growth but can generate very good cash to support the growth? And what are the areas that our products or categories that actually could have a better fit with somebody else. And I think that with this in mind, we can identify categories that we can have divested in the future.","Steven Strycula","And then a quick follow-up related to innovation, Miguel. What's your personal philosophy or strategy as you think about the patience to seed and build growth and, call it, longer-term categories? They might not be very large today, but might be the future of, call it, the portfolio or areas that could be a few hundred million dollar brands. So I guess to sum up, the question would really be, how does a company that's so ZBB focused think about immediate return on investment versus necessarily seeding and needing to grow for the longer term?","Miguel Patricio","And now I think that your question is very important, but let me tell you that, yes, I love ZBB. I really do. In my previous company, I worked for 22 years and I learned to love ZBB. But for one reason, because ZBB was a big lever or made it possible to grow the business throughout the year. So when I look at ZBB, I look at it as a discipline to make things every day better, so we can free up resources to invest in other products. I don't look at ZBB as a way to basically cut costs and cut costs. I see it as a way to do things better every day and have -- the consequence of that is to be more efficient and to free up resources to invest in the business.","But addressing your second point about how are you going to invest in things that today are small, and tomorrow can be big, are you going to have that discipline? I think that question is very, very important. I think companies tend to invest on what's big and not what it will grow, and I think we need to do both. And then we really need to understand what will grow and bet on it. It may be smaller today, but you need to have the patience to nurture these categories, these products, these brands to be big one day. I'm looking at this right now, not only brands but also channels that today may not be so representative, but have a great potential for the future. So I tend to agree with you, and I don't think that, that has to do with ZBB. It's just the opposite. I think that ZBB will free up resources to invest in these categories.","Operator","Our final question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","Yes. Thanks, Miguel, for sharing in details your progress. Very insightful, thank you. Actually, I do have two quick ones. I mean, first is other income. Could you please explain what is in the other income line this quarter? As you'd explained, about half of the beat in the quarter are about $0.08 in our math. And then more on the Plasmon business in Italy. Could you please explain why you changed your position in regards to the divestiture? And it will be interesting for us, I mean, in understanding the rationale here, I mean, as we further assess, I mean, other possible, I mean, the right opportunities for you?","Paulo Basilio","Thanks for the question. This is Paulo. So let me -- again, I'm going to -- I'm not going to comment on the consensus expectations for other income. But at the level of our other income, it was very similar to the levels that we had in prior year, pretty much the same type of level. Versus our expectations, it was a little bit better and pretty much driven by three factors. It's the first one, we had better return to the capital markets from our investments. We had some gains in hedging positions and also favorable FX in the balance. So this is pretty much how we -- how this other income line performed versus our internal expectations. So for Q4, to give a little bit more color here, we're expecting the other income to go down by around $20 million. It's part of the -- versus -- go down $10 million versus prior year. That's part of the headwind that we disclosed below the EBITDA lines. About divestitures, Miguel, would you want to comment?","Miguel Patricio","Yes, sure. No, I wanted to tell you about baby food, that I think it's -- we have a business that if you look at -- in baby food, if you look it individually at the countries where we have baby food, it's not very meaningful. We have baby food in a lot of countries, in Russia, in China, in Australia, in Italy, in U.K., in New Zealand, in Canada, in Colombia, in Mexico, all tiny business. Maybe the biggest one is in Italy. But all very tiny business. But when you put them together, it's $0.5 billion business, it's sizable. We are declining in the majority of these countries. And I tell you, I think that is basically because it's not very important in each one of the countries and also because we really do not have expertise, really expertise, big expertise on baby food. ","And if you look at the countries individually, we don't even have the scale, I think, to have this expertise. Now with the changes that we made in structure, with the appointment of Rafael as our Zone President International when we put Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe together, then he will have all this business or basically all this business together and becomes meaningful in his portfolio. He will put a team working on baby food. Understanding what moves baby food, understanding these sites, understanding the trends, understanding the needs of the moms and the babies that, because of scale, we didn't have today in each one of these countries. So it's a good example of capabilities that we have to build that by changing structure, we can get there. So that would be my comment about baby food.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time I will like to welcome everyone to the Kraft Heinz Company Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This listen-only is being recorded at the request of the Kraft Heinz Company for replay purposes. ","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik you may begin.","Chris Jakubik","Thank you, Amanda, and welcome to the Q2 2015 Business Update for Kraft Heinz Company bond holders. With me is our Chief Financial Officer, Paulo Basilio. During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. Statements are based on how see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. These are discussed in our earnings release which can be found in the Investor section of kraftheinzcompany.com. We'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.","Before we get started please note that the merger between Kraft Foods Group and HJ Heinz Holdings Corporation to form the Kraft Heinz Company was completed on July 2nd, 2015, which was after the close of the second quarters for each respective company.","So in keeping with Heinz\u2019s practice prior to the merger, this call will be a review of the premerger standalone financial results for each company in Q2 2015, as outlined in the press release we issued on August 10.","With that, I will hand it over to Paulo.","Paulo Basilio","Thank you, Chris. Turning first to Kraft, net revenue decreased 4.9% including a negative 1.4% impact from currency. Kraft Organic net revenues decreased 3.3% of course keeping up a 2.6% decline from volume mix and a 0.7% decline from lower net pricing. ","The volume mix decline included an approximate one percentage point negative impact from the timing of Easter-related shipments and an approximately one percentage point negative impact from lower ready-to-drink beverage sales, resulting from decreased promotional activities versus the prior year quarter, as well as retail inventory shifts this year. ","Lower net pricing reflected pricing actions in the Cheese and Food Services businesses, related to lower dairy costs. These were partially offset by the carry-over impact of price increases taken in prior quarter. ","Operating income was $923 million and diluted EPS was $0.92 inclusive of one-off factor in the quarter. Excluding the impact of these factors in both years, operating income grew at the mid-single digit rate and EPS grew at the double-digit rate. This growth was primarily driven by a combination of favorable commodity cost net of pricing mainly in the dairy and meat categories. ","Lower SG&A expenses driven by reduction in advertising spending and lower manufacturing costs driven by net productivity. EPS growth was further enhanced by a lower effective tax rate and lower net interest expense versus prior year quarter.","Free cash flow in the first six months of 2015 was $802 million, up from $454 million from the same period during the prior year. This year\u2019s [quarterly] working capital improvement has more than offset an increase in capital expenditures.","Now turning to Heinz; Sales decline 4.1% due to a negative 9.4% impact from foreign exchange translation and a 0.6 reduction from the divestiture of a frozen food business in the UK. Heinz organic net sale grew 5.9%. Net pricing increased by 4.2% driven by higher pricing across all segments, primarily Latin America.","Volume increased 1.7% driven by higher inventory stock at US retailers in the first quarter of 2014 prior to the implementation of SAP, as well as raw material and packaging supply constraints in Venezuela. ","These volume gains were partially offset by volume decline due to the timing of Ramadan festive season in Indonesia, reduced trade promotions in Russia, product rationalization in Europe and category declines in Italy. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased $46 million or 6.7% to $739 million, primarily driven by gross profit as a result of increased sales in North America and Venezuela, cost of goods sold productivity initiative and an overall reduction in SG&A. ","These gains were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation rate in all segments, and increased marketing spending in North America. Organic adjusted EBITDA grew 16.3%, driven increased sales and lower SG&A. ","I will now turn the call back to Chris Jakubik for closing remark.

We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release.","Now it's my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, Miguel Patricio. ","Miguel Patricio","Thank you Chris and hello everyone. Well first of all I'm honored to be with you today as the new CEO of Kraft Heinz. As someone who has worked on some of the biggest brands in the world I know intimately their power in the marketplace and with consumers. Kraft Heinz has some of the globe\u2019s best roughly 200 brands in nearly 200 countries with nearly 20 of them maintaining their relevance for 100 years or more. We are in 97% of American households today holding the number one or two spots in 50 categories. ","And I\u2019m humbled to follow the great CEOs that have successfully adapted our brands and businesses through periods of tremendous change over more than 100 years. These are great assets for any business. But at Kraft Heinz we have far bigger aspirations. That\u2019s why I want to be candid with you from the start of my tenure here. The valuation of our stock is now among the slowest in the industry and you deserve straight talk from me about how this business is run. I plan to do that to you today and for as long as I\u2019m here. ","The entire Board has mandated a new approach to Kraft Heinz. As such it\u2019s my job to tell you what we got wrong and why we got it wrong. Over the coming months I will share more with you about how we\u2019ll fix it but it starts right now with me and our entire senior management team. ","Our brands are icons, it\u2019s our job to ensure they are leading icons. To do that we must understand the future so we can lead, not follow. We must understand the consumer better than any other company. ","We have a good start on being data and process driven but we must put more attention on the consumer [indiscernible]. For instance we have sophisticated tools to tell quality-[made impressions] [ph] versus those that don\u2019t reach the consumer. But we're also the company that had the first plant-based burger, the Boca burger, but find ourselves far behind the plant-based market today. ","Many of you believe our story as one of cost control and zero-based budgeting. This has been strength to our company because they have enhanced our margins since the time of our merger. Without this discipline we would be in a worse place today. But we have to do more than that. We need to change so we can apply strong consistent investments in our brands.","There is no doubt our industry is in such a big moment of transformation, in retail, non-traditional channels, private label, premiumization, consumer values, health and wellbeing. Big transformation represents big opportunity and we as an organization need to be at the forefront of this change. My first 40 days at Kraft Heinz have been rich in learning with honest and candid conversations with our global leaders, employees as well as our customers. I have held numerous townhalls, had one-on-one with more than 300 employees and had the chance to visit all of our major offices around the world. Those conversations have left me with an enormous appreciation for the team that we have here at Kraft Heinz. ","Our team is hard working and motivated to drive the next chapter of the business and the consistent message I hear from them is that while they've been through a lot, they still have a strong desire to win. Their commitment to the company is why I am privileged to be their leader. But before we get into my first impressions and thoughts on our path forward, I'm going to ask David to review our first half results. ","David Knopf","Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. First off, with the filing of Forms 10-Q for both the first and second quarters, we expect to regain our current filer status with the SEC. The accounting review and audit process for our 10-K was a thorough and time intensive effort, and we restated past periods for misstatements that have occurred over the past four fiscal years. ","Overall, the magnitude of adjustments to our historical numbers was a cumulative impact from 2015 to 2018 of less than 1% of net income. We are now taking extensive actions to improve internal policies and procedures, and to strengthen internal controls, including over financial reporting. ","To date, we have already implemented a comprehensive disciplinary plan for all employees found to have engaged in misconduct; enhanced our organization, augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional experienced professionals in the area of supplier contracts and related arrangements, as well as realigned reporting lines, so procurement finance now reports directly to the finance organization, and have enhanced the level of precision at which our internal controls for financial reporting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed. ","We're also in the process of reassessing employees\u2019 KPIs, and will be implementing checkpoints to evaluate the impacts from significant changes in the environment, as well as evaluating potential solutions to upgrade our procurement management software, and deploying a comprehensive global procurement training program. ","Taking these steps to improve internal controls is of the utmost importance for our Board, Miguel and myself. It will continue to be a high priority for the organization going forward. And I would like to thank all parties for their support and dedication, especially our finance and legal teams, our Board of Directors, our financial partners, among others. ","Regarding our first half performance, overall, while our consumption and share trends continued to improve, our first half results were held back by actions at a number of our retail partners in both the U.S. and Canada to reduce the amount of inventory they carry. We continued to suffer from higher supply chain costs. And frankly, the absolute level of year-on-year declines in EBITDA and EPS are simply unacceptable. ","If you recall, in February, we set our priorities around improving our growth and returns by driving consumption and market share, and leveraging in-store sales and e-commerce investments to build our brands and grow our categories. So far this year, our retail takeaway in both United States and Canada have continued to grow and improve since the second half of 2018 and into the first half of 2019.","In the United States, first half consumption in measured channels was up 1.1% versus the prior year with market share gains in more than half of our business. In Canada retail sales consumption grew nearly 4% in the first half, although this was aided by return to a more normal promotional calendar versus the prior year. And we\u2019ve continued our strong push on condiments and sauces around the world with significant advertising and merchandising activity behind the Heinz 150 year anniversary. ","But on the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date, as well as the fact that retailer inventory reductions dampened our potential for the first half and the full year.","In terms of sales for the first half, we outlined in February the sources of our organic net sales decline. These included unfavorable promotional timing in both the United States and Canada as well as difficult comparisons versus an exceptionally strong prior year in UK soups. In addition to that we also saw a negative impact from lower inventory levels at retail in North America that we did not anticipate, as well as lost sales due to trade negotiations in parts of Continental Europe as we implemented good, better, best pricing in ketchup between our Heinz and newly repatriated Kraft brands. ","From a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5% in the first half, including an adverse impact of approximately 1.2 percentage points from retail inventory reductions primarily in the U.S. and Canada. ","Volume mix was relatively flat in the first half as the reduction in retail inventory levels more than offset consumption growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Pricing was negative, down 1.3 percentage points, driven by three factors. The first factor driving lower pricing was unfavorable timing of promotional expense, representing roughly 80 basis point decrease in price on a global basis, including approximately 90 basis points in the U.S. ","In the U.S., while we expected promotional timing to be a source of year-over-year decline in the first half, it should turn favorable in the second half of the year and therefore relatively neutral for the full year. By contrast, the step-up in Canada reflects greater activity versus last year, including the natural cheese business that we just sold and it\u2019s not likely to reverse in the second half. ","The second factor was key commodity driven pricing in North America, representing roughly 30 basis point drag on global pricing in the first half. And third, the remainder primarily reflects continued promotional support behind selects for select U.S. categories, mainly in our Launchables and frozen categories. ","With respect to profitability, we spoke about our first quarter and indeed our first half being up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year. This reflected our expected net inflation curve, stepped up fixed cost investments and retail channel growth, marketing and our people, as well as pricing not beginning to take effect until the second quarter.","In the end, the cost inflation picture while improving remained unfavorable versus the prior year across packaging, manufacturing and logistics in the United States. And this together would stepped up fixed cost investments drove roughly half of the constant currency production in first half EBITDA we saw versus the prior year. ","Regarding adjusted EPS, the decline we saw in the first half reflected lower adjusted EBITDA, as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses versus the prior year period. ","Other income and our effective tax rate versus the first half of 2018 were more favorable than we expected, such that in total below the line items were a $0.02 benefit to adjusted EPS versus the first six months of 2018. ","From a forward-looking perspective, we have now completed the two divestitures we previously announced: India nutritional beverages and Canada natural cheese. These divestitures resulted in a combined after-tax proceeds of more than $1.5 billion. And we remain committed to using those proceeds to further deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet. ","However, I will highlight here that with regards to our effective tax rate, we continue to expect roughly 21% for the full year. The first half was only 18.4% due to the timing of discrete items, but this benefit is not expected to repeat, resulting in a higher rate in the second half, especially in Q3. And for the second half of 2019, specifically, we continue to expect to see an improvement in year-over-year top and bottom-line growth rate versus what we saw in the first half. This should be driven by continued momentum in consumer offtake and more innovation coming to market, improved pricing trends, particularly as our price increases in the U.S. take hold and lapping some of the stepped up fixed costs and cost inflation that we saw in the back half of last year. Although I would note that we are seeing risk from further reductions in retailer inventory levels, as well as accelerating key commodity costs in the U.S. that we had not anticipated at the start of the year.","Now I'll turn it back to Miguel.","Miguel Patricio","Thank you, David. I'll start by saying that the level of decline versus previous year is nothing we are proud of, and nothing that any of us should find acceptable moving forward. And while I have officially been the CEO for roughly 40 days at this point, I think it's important to make a candid assessment of where I think we are today. ","At the outset, I shared many of the concerns that a good number of you have expressed over things like brand support, supply chain execution, the sustainability of our profits, and just how long it would take to be in the position to start growing both the top-line and the bottom-lines. ","And our Board of Directors made it clear that they wanted to bring change in light of the company's recent missteps and have given me their full support to contemplate any tasks that will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. So far, I have found as you might expect, things are rarely as bad or as good, as what you read from the outside. ","What is clear is that we win when we strongly and consistently invest in our brands. For instance, thanks to innovations and investments to extend a 150-year old brand into new segments, Heinz achieved an all time high market share in U.S. ketchup reaching 70% in the second quarter. And Philadelphia has consistently grown share and grown the category year-over-year since 2014 with 68% share year-to-date by setting the standard for superior quality and taste. ","We have also built a world class quality organization that has had the fewest recalls in the food industry over the past four years. Since 2015 we invested more than $1 billion of CapEx in North America alone including significant investments on the end of the line for detection, risk avoidance and consumer complaint mitigation. These are just some examples of great things I have seen at the company in my early days. But it\u2019s also important to face the cold hard facts and assess where we have had shortfalls. ","First and foremost the company had a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA margins from a peak of 29.4% in the fiscal 2017 to roughly 24.5% for the trailing 12 months through the end of June this year. This was driven by a combination of inflation in our supply chain, including packaging, freight, overtime, and maintenance costs, as well as significant step up in fixed costs to support sales growth with price increases lagging higher costs. ","Regarding our supply chain problems in 2018, it\u2019s clear we lost forecast accuracy and our ability to execute productivity initiatives to offset market inflation. I believe we persisted with integration-minded cost cutting and did not pivot to a continuous improvement productivity driven mindset soon enough. ","Before I arrived the company started to take actions to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. But I see opportunity to go further by bringing in more technical expertise in critical areas, by improving collaboration and process between our category and supply chain teams, by doing a better job of understanding root causes of supply chain losses and this needs to be supported by our finance team leading across functional efforts to improve visibility.","So one of my main priorities now and going forward is to make sure we have a much better visibility in our supply chain as well as more robust ongoing productivity initiatives. I believe this critical part of the company should and can generate significant productivity. If we have the proper visibility we can build a solid pipeline of efficiencies-oriented initiatives across our value chain. ","Moving to our fixed costs or SG&A, since 2015 we have taken out significant costs from the business. We also reinvested roughly $300 million last year in areas like people, go-to-market capabilities, marketing and innovation. To be honest it's too early for me to tell which investments will generate the returns we expect. But my experience tells me that whenever there are a lot of big investments in such a short period of time it\u2019s difficult to see all of them working at once. ","It\u2019s therefore critical that we prioritize the ones that are working and that fit the strategic agenda that we're currently developing. And for the investments that are not working, we move those dollars to areas that may need more investment. As examples, I believe our investments in media remain low despite fixed costs and overall marketing spend increasing over the past two years. ","On the brand and innovation side, we need to become more consumer obsessed so we can better predict their behavior even before they know it. There are practices that need to change in the product development process, so we can be faster and more consumer-centric with our new products. And we need to better balance spending and marketing, innovations versus core brand support. ","And in terms of retail channel development, Kraft Heinz has grown rapidly and has had strong share performance in e-commerce but we really need to take a step back and develop a longer term outlook of the channel growth, and how Kraft Heinz can win and assess the incrementality of each customer. ","So it's not just about cutting costs. It\u2019s becoming more about efficiency, and making dollars already in [outer base] [ph] work harder elsewhere. ","Let me turn now to my priorities and the opportunities I see ahead of us. When I became CEO last month, I established three immediate goals with the Board. The first, which should be obvious, is to get to know our business, our consumers, our customers and my colleagues. The second is to execute our existing 2019 business plan. The third and most important is to lead a comprehensive review to develop a new strategic agenda for the next three to five years.","It is critical that we get the organization to concentrate on setting our strategic directions, and laying the foundation for our future, now.","We need to ask ourselves the hard questions about our business, not thinking about the short-term or next quarter. And we need to take the time to seek out external and internal inspiration and build on best practices, both within Kraft Heinz and from other world class brands. ","From a financial perspective, we do expect many of the top and bottom-line factors that held back the first half to [indiscernible] in the second half. But I\u2019ve asked David that we not provide or update specific point estimate financial guidance. Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities. ","In addition, as I'm learning the business and develop our strategic agenda, I want us to spend more time evaluating the questions of the investors. We absolutely remain committed to our investment grade credit rating., But our more urgent priority is to get the organization fixated on our consumers and customers. And in this process ensure we don't rush to give away potential value to others. ","We have already started the work and taking some early actions to put in place the right team and the right structure to help achieve my three immediate priorities. As you may have seen my first act as CEO was to make some changes in our structure to help accelerate our progress.","First, I have taken on the U.S. President role on an interim basis. U.S. represents 70% of our company and this will help me understand our business, consumers and the customers faster. For me this big dive is an essential step to developing the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value for Kraft Heinz.","I also established a new role International zone President for Kraft Heinz combining our EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American zones representing 20% of our global business. We did this to create streamlined, more robust international structure, to find commonalities, refine their strategy and drive the business with greater speeds. ","We will continue to share more of our approach to the strategic agenda over the coming quarters. We expect to complete our work by the year end. And anticipate sharing our conclusions with you early next year. As we build this plan my experience has shown that to truly change the momentum of a business we must understand the future identifying where the consumer, their needs and the marketplace are headed. And then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands will serve those needs better than the competition. ","Further, I believe we can and must find internal efficiencies whether in our supply chain or fixed cost base that had both increased substantially in our last two years that can help to fund this strategy. Intense discipline is a virtue but it\u2019s not an end in itself. I believe great companies are the ones that keep expenses under control so they can use the capital for new investments that grow both the top-line and the bottom-line. It\u2019s not one or the other. ","As I look ahead I\u2019m very excited about the opportunities at Kraft Heinz. Similar to my attention to consumer, customers and colleagues, I also look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. ","Now, we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar ","So first from me a little more broadly. As you mentioned there's been so much written and said about Kraft Heinz really just into even 4Q results in February, which immediately feels like a lifetime Miguel. It\u2019s a little hard to know from the outside I guess what range true or not. So first off, perhaps if you could just go through a little bit of specifics on what you see as some of maybe the biggest misperceptions among investors at this stage, both positive and negative? And then I just got a follow up. ","Miguel Patricio","Sorry, I\u2019m not going to comment on rumors or on speculation about what people think about Kraft Heinz. But I\u2019m glad to tell you why I\u2019m optimistic and why I\u2019m here at Kraft Heinz. I really believe on the power of brand it\u2019s got. And I think that we have an amazing portfolio of brands, some are shiny, some are not. But I think the heritage that we have in the brands, the household proliferation that we have, the awareness that we have makes me feel very positive about the possibility of turning around some of the trends that we have in the brands that are not doing as well.","I also think that we have a great scale. And that is a very competitive advantage in America.","And I am also very, very excited about the possibility of turning the business around. I have done it before in my life and I think that it is possible.","Now to take a business around, I think it\u2019s critical that we define comprehensive strategy. And this strategy has to be based on understanding the future, understanding the consumer. I believe that if we have -- the industry is in huge transformation today. And transformation is also a moment of opportunity. And the ones that are going to take this opportunity are the ones that will understand the future better than the others. So they will lead. The ones that will not understand will follow. And the followers will not win. So we need again to set a comprehensive simple strategy for the future and be very disciplined on making and executing them. ","So, I'm very excited, I am much more excited today after 40 days than I was on day one about our future. ","Andrew Lazar ","Thanks for that. And I know you're not ready to address, obviously, what you see is sort of a more sustainable margin structure for the business yet, going forward. But as you mentioned, EBITDA margins have sort of come in some 500 basis points or so in the past three years. Some of that's been reinvestment, whether in marketing or capabilities, and some has been related to other items, but margins are still well above the Group average. So I guess my question is, do you think Kraft Heinz with its sort of geographic portfolio and relative market share makeup, should be able to sustain a margin structure still well above the Group or not? Because in your prepared remarks, I think you talked about more efficiently using the spending that's already in the base. Thanks so much. ","Miguel Patricio","Yes. Thank you Andrew. Well, let me start saying again that I truly believe that we need to invest much more, especially in our people, and our brands. I think that as I said before that our media investments are below where they should be. But before going after new investments, I would really look at the possibility of inefficiencies in the system so I can reorganize and redeploy these investments. I am still -- of course, it\u2019s early to talk about it but I'm seeing a lot of inefficiencies and this could bring us big opportunities. I'll give you just two examples so I'm not so theoretical. ","In marketing, we increased investment in the last two years. But in media, we've been declining. We grew investments or we put money behind many other things, agency fees, production, research, product development. But the thing that the consumer really sees, we declined to pay the other expense. This was in our inefficiencies that we can redeploy. ","I will give you another example, maybe because of all the complexity that we put in the system, our supply chain losses have been increasing actually double-digits in the last years, that\u2019s not acceptable. We need to understand very well the root causes of the supplier chain losses and that to reduce them. We got losses that can be converted in investments. So just two examples of inefficiencies that I have seen very early here in my job. And this has to be my focus before talking about new investments and reducing the margin. I\u2019d be going after inefficiencies, that can put best in the system to feed the growth and seeing them. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe ","I just want to ask a question. You spoke about -- and I had a benefit of listening to your comments there about needing visibility, improving processes, bringing new technical expertise. From a high level that sounds like that\u2019s a lot more blocking and tackling, basic improvements would be made to Kraft Heinz in order to get the business to where you would like it. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, for the timing or expense or something to understand. Those factors, those items that have kind of missing at Kraft Heinz today that -- how long you\u2019re talking, how much do you think it will cost to get the company to the point where you think you a visibility you need and the processes in place to better grow the business? ","Miguel Patricio","So Chris let me go back a little bit in time, Kraft Heinz. I think when you put two companies together, the first cycle or first phase or first cycle has to be really about bringing new culture and extracting inefficiencies. I think the company did a good job on that. We extracted a lot of efficiencies. We passed a lot of costs. But then after two years, it\u2019s hard to continue to cutting costs. You need to change the strategy or you need to change the path. In the first year you have two CEOs, you cut one CEO, so that\u2019s cost cutting but the following year don\u2019t have another CEO to cut. Cost cutting is a one-off activity and it is necessary when you have the opportunities. But then you have to move and you have to think about how do you reduce costs but in a different way and that way is really -- you have to change the way of operating the business, it\u2019s about efficiencies, it\u2019s about making better everyday forever. You need to change the mindset. And if you reduce cutting costs trouble, you can get in trouble. I think that this second phase starts now with me. Yes, it could have started before and I think the company would have benefit from that, but it didn\u2019t. And so it starts now with me and I\u2019m going to put a big emphasis on that, not on cost cutting but on efficiencies in the system, extracting efficiencies from the system, making better every day, making our factories much more efficient, making our execution in sales much better, making our marketing investments, as I mentioned before, much better as well. So we invest on things that consumer see, not on the consumer doesn't see et cetera, et cetera.","Hopefully I was able to answer your question, Chris.","Chris Growe ","Yes, that makes good sense. And thank you for that color there. I had a quick question for David. Just do you expect -- you're not giving guidance for the year, but if you could provide us some context around FX and variable compensation and non-key commodity? Are those figures you can update today David or you would wait to get more information on those?","David Knopf","Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. So, like Miguel said, we're not providing at this point guidance. But I can give some additional color on some of the items below the line. So we continue to expect up to $0.25 of unfavorability below adjusted EBITDA line for the full year relative to 2018. And this negative impact will be greater in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half for a couple different reasons. ","First off, the largest driver is tax. We have some discrete benefits in the first half, whereas we expect some discrete costs within the back half of the year. Second, we did see some FX favorability in the first half in other income that may flip in the second half. Third, related to incentive based comp, will have a significant expense in the second half of the year. And this is due to the timing of the delayed filings of our 10-K and our 10-Qs whereas we typically expect that to happen in the first half of the full year. ","And then finally, we may see some higher interest expense in the second half as well.","Miguel Patricio","Maybe let me add on this point, Chris, because I believe this was a big disappointment for you that we're not giving you guidance. And I'll go further a little bit and tell you why? First, because I believe that for Kraft Heinz -- and now we need -- what we don't need is to be focused on internal -- on profit targets on the short-term. We have a big agenda to build. We have a second half to deliver. But I think that working on short-term targets will not help. ","But second, since I've been here just for 40 days, I wouldn't feel comfortable about giving a guidance, that I still do not have the necessary confidence about this number. I'm not sure if I'm going to overachieve my second half if I'm going to underachieve or I will achieve.","When -- in this situation, when managers look at the leaders always with empty pockets, right, like they don't know me yet, but what I know is that in the second half some of the pressures that we had in the first half will face pressures like supply costs, or even commercial costs and that is positive. ","However, there's also risks, and risks such as further retailer inventory reductions, commodity inflation in categories where private label has had a lot of success, like natural cheese, meat, and coffee. But one observation that I made early on is that from a seasonality standpoint, historically, Kraft Heinz usually earned 60% of the 50% -- at least the 50% of the EBITDA in the first half of the year, but that\u2019s just an observation. So we will see how we do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. ","Bryan Spillane ","So first question from me I guess, we\u2019ve gotten this a few times this morning on just how we should be thinking about confidence in the dividend going forward, particularly in the context of at least I guess not having the EBITDA guidance we had before. So if you could just talk about how you are thinking about the dividend and what factors may or may not affect it? ","David Knopf","Sure, Bryan, this is David. Thanks for the question. So, as we said before we are committed to our investment grade rating and we firmly believe that our business today generates sufficient free cash flow to support both delevering organically over time as we\u2019ve committed as well as to support the current dividend payout that we have. On top of that we have taken actions as you know earlier this year to accelerate the delevering producing our dividend and successfully divesting India beverages and Canada cheese businesses a couple of digits multiple. So again we feel that the business currently generates sufficient cash flow to cover the dividend and also to delever organically. ","Bryan Spillane ","And then Miguel, just you\u2019re going to the process of reviewing the business. There has been some commentary in the past about potentially just evaluating the portfolio, and gets implied additional asset sale. So could you just provide your perspective not so much on what you might be thinking about doing but just probably more from a higher level just how you think about asset sales in terms of how they create value, don't create value? Just what parameters you're thinking about in terms of what would tend you to do something along those lines.","Miguel Patricio","Bryan, nice talking to you, I don\u2019t want to be evasive on your question. But actually I don\u2019t want to talk about divestitures or non-divestitures until we make our strategic decisions. I think that has to get consequence after what portfolio you\u2019re going to carry for the future and only after refining and having these approved with our Board and discussed and approved, I think we should be talking about divestitures. For that reason at this moment, that question is not undertaken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. ","Ken Goldman ","Just a clarification and not to beat the dead horse, but you do already have guidance of the year, right, you\u2019ve talked about positive organic sales growth and adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. I just want to make sure I understand, are you officially pulling this guidance or you\u2019re just opting not to address it today? ","David Knopf","Hi, Ken, this is David. So that\u2019s right that we're not providing guidance for the full year so we're pulling guidance. But I can provide a little bit of color on our expectations for the full year without giving an updated point estimate for sales or EBITDA. So like I said before we do expect to see better year-over-year performance on top and bottom-line in the second half versus the first half and some of the drivers are what\u2019s consistent with what we said in February and there is some new potential risk to that as well. So what hasn\u2019t changed versus our expectations in February are continued retail takeaways that we\u2019ve seen in the market with U.S. consumption of 1%, Canada consumption of 4%, and that we expect we continue to be supported by accelerated innovation in the back half. And we've also seen some promising growth globally in our food service business as well. ","On top of that, we expect to see improved pricing trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. And this will happen with some of the trade timing overlapping, as long as the price increases in the U.S. that we implemented later in the first half that will fully lap in the second half as well. ","And then finally, on the positive side, as Miguel mentioned earlier, we do expect to see improving cost inflation as we start to lap some of the higher costs that we had in second half of 2018. ","We has changed versus our expectations in February as we progressed through Q2 is we see risks for further retailer inventory reductions in the second half. Although we can\u2019t say what that may look like, we do see additional risk. And on top of that, we also see risk from accelerating key commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. in meats and dairy but we will definitely try to manage via price, but could be a risk to us in the second half. ","And then finally, we also have some potential adverse currency translation versus our expectations in February. ","Ken Goldman ","Okay, thank you for that. I appreciate it. And then my follow up. Miguel I know you're not ready to really talk about this in detail, and I understand it. But there's been a lot of talk today about supply chain, shifting the mindset of going from a merger savings model to ongoing productivity. But is there anything you can give us specifically in terms of what's really going wrong on the top-line? I know you mentioned media spending having gone down and so forth. But just your initial take, because to me that's the most important thing that Kraft can to do to turn the story around is to reverse the top-line trend. So if there's any specifics you can share with us right now that'd be great? ","Miguel Patricio","I think that we need to have a big focus on both bottom-line and the top-line. Maybe in the past, we were too focused on the bottom-line. We need a strategy, first of all for growth, which is critical. We need to find opportunities, find white spaces, what brands to invest, what channels today that do have lower share, what channels should I invest more, and structure for growth, what countries where we should attack and grow and bet on. And these will all be part of our strategy for growth. ","So examples, just I was talking here with my colleagues that, a country that I know very well, China. In China we have a very good business on soy sauce. We are leaders in two of the provinces, Guangdong and Fujian, that's two of the most -- the richest provinces. But we are only three. It's a business or it's a industry, soy sauce is an industry $12 billion, it grows 8% per year. And we have great activity there. But we are just in two province, big opportunity to grow outside of this province. There is the big opportunity to have other sauces not only soy sauce. Why haven't we done it? I don't know exactly. But I see this as big opportunity for white space but we have to organize ourselves for growth. It's also good policies, mindsets that we have to do it. And to fund -- and we have to work on the other side, to fund these growth initiatives. We have to be very efficient. We need to be more efficient than everybody else. And to tell you the truth when I came and when I arrived here I was absolutely sure that I would find these opportunities for growth, I was not sure if we had to opportunity for efficiencies because I didn\u2019t know the business. And today I know that we have. There are many other white spaces like in the West, talking about ethnicity, 20% of the population in America is Hispanic and represents 40% of the growth of the population. We don\u2019t have absolutely anything in our portfolio today to attend this population. We don\u2019t even communicate to the Hispanic community. That gives an opportunity. So I\u2019m looking at these opportunities everywhere from a brand standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from ethnicity standpoint, from a country standpoint. And this will be only tools that we will put in our plan that we will present to our Board at the end of the year and to you at the beginning of next year. Hopefully, I was able to answer your question. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. ","David Palmer ","Welcome Miguel. Supply chain savings or like it rather was cited as a big reason for the last 2018 shortfall. Where do you believe your supply chain costs not, just the competencies, are relative to where they should be? And I asked because I think there is a lot that wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear some of the investments needed given the stories we heard out there, not just that the savings are not there as the company stated last year? And I had a quick follow-up.","Miguel Patricio","Look the good news is that the service level that we had in the first half I think were the best I don\u2019t know if ever or in the last year but were very, very high and very, very good. So that is a good news. And I whole credit give to the changes that were made not by me that was way before on the leadership of supply area. So this is one part and we are putting things in place, at present we\u2019re working on simple things which is basically the execution. We are in a much better place. For the future what we did was to open a front both with inside and outside or external people or talent to help us define what is good match for efficiencies for the future. We opened eight fronts that go from supply chain losses to service level that go to people, that go to cost, it\u2019s productivity on the line and these are not projects, this will be a way of living. We\u2019ve been too focused on the present and literally on fire fighting, there is a fire there, let\u2019s extinguish the fire. We need to work on our competencies for the future with the mentality of make it better every day. Again, this is a mentality shift that I lived before in my life, in my professional life that I know what it means and will come forever. This will feed our future in supply, in service level, but also on cost through doing things better, through efficiencies.","David Palmer ","And just a quick follow up, there was some reinvestment that was made last year I think was it $300 million in some levels of brand support. You said that there's some inefficiencies there. But as far as the return on that investment, and return on any investment you're making in marketing your brands in the categories that you're in, do you feel like there are enough microcosms or individual success stories that you can build upon here? And what would those be? Because I think there's a lot of questions about return on any marketing investment in some of the categories that you're in. And thank you.","Miguel Patricio","Look let me start with progresses. Consumption is that -- we haven't seen consumption up for a long time, share are flat. And I would say the same here in terms of -- and I have here reports from Neilson with 21 categories, 13 of them have positive shares in the first half of the year. So I could argue with you that some of -- there are a lot of investments that are working. I would mentioned, Heinz Ketchup, with the innovation that we had, and the communication is a very good example. Innovation to premiumize the brand, launching organic versions, no added sugar, that we can charge more that have higher margins. And that helps us well, the image of the brand. And that is a very good example of what to do. We put more money behind the brand and we achieve all kinds of shares, 60% to 70% share. That's a good example. ","So, but on the other hand again as I said, I think we can do a much better job on focus on investments on core brands, not dilute at among a lot of brands and small brands, do more innovation on big brands instead of launching too many new brands, having innovation is more incremental and not dilutive. I think we did a lot of brand extensions but not enough of accretive innovation. So there is a big homework to be done in marketing. I don't think everything is wrong at all and there a lot of good examples but we could -- we can do better and consistently invest in our brands. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. And welcome Miguel. Two questions from me as well. And you probably just kind of touched on it by referencing consumption and market share trends, but appreciate the commentary on the reinvestment into people, in media and maybe in some white space opportunities. A lot of investors we speak with have also questioned whether or not investment may be necessary in price whether it be to narrow price gaps with private label, or change the economics of retailers to incent and to focus more on your brands. I would love it if you could just maybe comment on that on where you where you see these price gaps and the retailer economics today and whether or not you think you're properly aligned?","Miguel Patricio","Look, I think that the pricing is an area of opportunity. And I would even say that both pricing, revenue management overall. But specifically on pricing I think that on categorires that we lead we need to meet the pricing and maybe in the past it took us too much time to pass inflation and we suffered with that. I also think that pricing -- averages on pricing are dangerous because we have brands like Heinz Ketchup or like Philadelphia that industry innovation -- or not innovation, we have been able to track price and we continue growing and we're achieving all time highs in that market share. But of course we have more pressure on categories where we have more competition from private label and where kind of more driven by commodities like cheese. So David mentioned before that yes, one of the risk we have in the second half is because cheese -- the commodity of cheese is increasing dramatically, the price of cheese and we\u2019re tracking price and we are expecting private label to follow, but we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a risk. So that would be my comment on pricing, but I would like to go beyond, I think opportunities in revenue management exist as well. I think we can do a better job to maximize the discount. Discount is a big investment and I think we can be much better on allocating discount by count, by product throughout the year, understand better what works in what way and when and how. And I also think that innovation can play a big role on revenue management and as a consequence on pricing. So I think there are good opportunities in this area to explore moving forward.","Jason English","Thank you, that's helpful. And my last question, I appreciate that you guys don't want to box yourself in with specific guidance for this year, but you did have another impairment charge fairly sizable one related to a new five-year operating forecast or revised expectations and priorities. I was hoping you could put a little more context around what is changing as you look out over the next five years versus maybe where your expectations were at the end of last year? ","David Knopf","Jason, this is David, thanks for the question. So on the impairment side, first off our impairment testing as you know occurs in 2Q every year. And so we performed our testing procedure this year after we file the 10-K current concurrent with preparing our Q1 and Q2 financial statements. And then to reiterate these are preliminary numbers that we disclose in 8-K. So the preliminary impairment charge in the first half were driven by two main factors. So first off, as you said we did have revised expectations in response to current market factors in some of our international businesses that were evaluated during the first quarter of 2019 as we developed these five-year plans. And as a reminder these are EMEA East reporting unit, LTA Exports reporting unit and Brazil where we had an impairment. ","Secondly, we also had the application of a higher discount rate to reflect the sustained decline in our stock price since the start of the year. And also you should keep in mind that we did start the year at nearly $60 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles with less than 20% attrition relative to carrying value. So what that means is there's going to be risk of future impairments, given any change in forecasts or modeling assumption can particularly trigger that. ","And to answer your question specifically, as we kind of updated develop these operating forecasts, we did have lower revenue and margin expectations, specifically for the three reporting units that I mentioned, EMEA East, Brazil and LTA Exports. The six brands that were impaired within Q2 were driven by the increase in the discount rate, which again, was reflecting the sustained reduction in our stock price since the start of the year. ","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today will come from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning and welcome Miguel. A very short opening question then a little bit more of a strategic one. So the short question would be, as you think about the strategic review, when should the investment community as a whole kind of expect to receive the output of the notification? And then from a strategic standpoint, wanted to understand, given your experience at ABI, a different industry, what are some of the similarities and dissimilarities relative to Kraft\u2019s portfolio that you observed? And how that ultimately impact call it the earnings power of the company? I recognize your private label is low in that industry, but how does that kind of shape your view with the current portfolio they're working with? Thank you.","Miguel Patricio","Okay, Steve, look, we'll update you through the rest of the year on how strategic work is going. But it's our intention to share with our Board at the end of the year, and then sharing with you at the beginning of next year. ","Now talking a little bit about my experience with food -- well with beer and how this has -- can be adapted to food, I think there are a lot of similarities, but there a lot of differences as well. And I think this has been actually pretty good, arriving here with fresh eyes and asking questions that some were obvious, but people were not asking themselves for a long time. Some were not obvious and they have not been asked about it before. And so this has been positive.","I think that my experience in the past both from leading global brands at ABI and using premiumization are the ways to grow top-line was very interesting. When I was Head of Marketing, ABI had been growing substantially because of mix, because of premium brands. And I think actually this is an opportunity for the industry. That is a bit of premiumization going on. But the premiumization actually is coming much more from the small players not from the big players. But let me share with you another experience from my past that I think we can adapt here at Kraft Heinz. I ran our business in Asia, and China has been the best story of organic growth for ABI.","And the reason why we succeeded was because we understood the future of business in China better than anybody else. And we understood that economic growth would bring huge premiumization, wealth, the channels will change -- channel would grow immensely. And so we made all the best in the future. We made all the best in what would grow, not what was big necessarily. And that happened. And making that parallel with Kraft Heinz, I think it is critical for us. Yes, we need to navigate through the present but we need to build a strategy for the future. We need to find where this business is going to grow, where food is going to grow and be ahead of everybody else. ","In terms of China we understood that much even than the local brewers. We understood China better than them. And I think that -- again this is why I was talking about the future before. If we understand the future and we believe the future we're going to win and the ones that will not understand will just follow. And I really want to be in the first group not in the second group. ","So as I said before, there is big transformation in food, negative people would be afraid of that. I\u2019m an optimistic by nature and I believe that this transformation is an area of big opportunity, it is the one that will understand the future, are the ones that are going to win and will be those. ","Well this was the last question. I just would like to finish just by saying a couple of words maybe summarizing of little bit of what we talked during this call. I wanted to tell you or to report how excited and how delighted I am with the opportunity to take Kraft Heinz to the next level. I\u2019m, the way that you are, disappointed with the first half results. But I\u2019m determined to rebuild our business momentum. I have our Board support and not only support and expectation to have a new direction and move forward. And for me there are no sacred cows, no preconceived ideas, just fresh eyes and just thinking about what is best for our great company. I know there\u2019s a lot of headwinds but I see also encouraging solid consumption trends that are very positive. But we must continue to work our portfolio, our strategy and in fact strategically to put ourselves in a position for top-line and bottom-line growth. We need to improve our speed. We need to become absolutely obsessed with the consumer and understand the future better than anybody else. ","We need to pivot from a cost cutting mentality to a continuous improvement, efficiency focused. And we need to strengthen the balance sheet. That remains a priority. ","So thank you very much for your time. I\u2019m delighted to be here with you today. I am really looking forward to knowing you personally and to be sharing our -- my views and to learning from you as well. Thank you very much. ","Chris Jakubik","Thanks, everyone for joining.

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kraft Heinz Company's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update for the third quarter of 2017. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO; George Zoghbi, our Former Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business and now Strategic Advisor; Paulo Basilio, our former CFO and new President of the U.S. Zone; and David Knopf, taking over for Paulo as CFO, most recently the Head of our Planters business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now, let's turn to slide 2 and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris; and hello, everyone. Since our last call, there's been a lot of talk about changes in the industry and how consumer staples companies will adapt to this new reality. We believe in this fast-moving environment, the companies that are adaptable and data and consumer driven will have an edge in the marketplace.","With that, I would like to start by saying our plans and our progress remains on track. Our Q3 results were consistent with our expectations for sequential improvement, and we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth going forward. As far as results go, and I believe I said on our last call that, while we're not entirely satisfied with our financials, we are confident in our ability to drive further improvement going forward, and that remains the case today.","Our Q3 operating numbers show a good pickup in momentum, despite the usual mix of ups and downs that come with running a global business. We saw sequential improvement in all segments, both top and bottom line. Despite some category-specific volume losses, we have been willing to accept in a few countries, some supply chain issues in the United States and other headwinds that come about in the rest-of-the-world market.","What's more encouraged is that sales are starting to leverage the business investments we have been making. For instance, EBITDA growth was solid, despite the dire (3:16) balance of pricing and commodity costs not coming to as strongly as anticipated as bacon and dairy costs picked up during the quarter and pricing has yet to catch up. And we continue to improve against our goal of maintaining strong margins as savings in each region have continued to come in strong and cumulative savings from our Integration Program went $1.58 billion at the end of Q3.","Going forward, there is no doubt that the retail environment in most parts of the world will remain challenged. But as the retail landscape changes from market to market, the challenge for us is the same and the same as it's ever been to adapt quickly and stay relevant in all channels. It's interesting to note the challenge we are facing in Europe, especially in the UK, at this time last year. Today in UK, you are once again delivered sustainable, profitable growth in all channels, including e-commerce and discounters, with significant opportunity across Europe is still ahead of us.","The lesson is that the ability to adapt quickly is critical. For some time now, we have been talking about building out in-house capability in innovation and renovation, marketing, category management, and go-to-market capabilities for better data-driven insights and faster decision-making, and you are beginning to see the benefits coming through in the marketplace.","From the growth, we are seeing our condiments and sauces portfolio in most every markets we're in, given we have been working at this the longest. To other big bet innovations, renovations, and whitespace, such as frozen meals and snacks in United States and Planters in China. To the stability and improvement in market share trends, we are seeing developed markets like the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia.","In the past several weeks, we have taken a detailed steps to make sure that Kraft Heinz is organizing resources in a way that puts intense focus on our biggest opportunities. We are making these changes based on our culture of meritocracy and ownership. You probably have seen our public announcements promoting George Zoghbi to Strategic Adviser, Paulo Basilio to U.S. Zone President, and David Knopf to CFO.","But we have also been taking additional actions behind the scenes to improve our capability. For instance, we promoted Nina Barton, our Head of U.S. Market, Innovation and R&D to a new role as President of our Global Online and Digital Growth Initiatives, reporting directly to me. In her new role, Nina is responsible for leading all Kraft Heinz e-commerce platforms, accelerating digital transformation, and driving new online business.","We also promoted Michelle St. Jacques to Head of Brands and R&D, reporting directly to Paulo. In her new role, Michelle is responsible for breakthrough innovation, the centralized parts of R&D, as well as managing brand building best practice that feed into our category teams at the business unit level.","So to sum it all up, through the first nine months of 2017, the investments we have been making are starting to have the impact in the marketplace and the P&L that you have been expecting. And we have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter that should allow us to deliver profitable sales, to deliver strong earnings growth for the full year, and sets us up for further gains in 2018.","So let's turn to slide 3 and the details of our Q3 financials. Starting with net sales, there are two things to highlight. First, total organic sales tilted to positive growth in Q3 with sequentially better performance in every reporting segment. And second, we had better overall volume-mix performance, driven by growth engines, such as condiments and sauces in most markets across the Kraft Heinz world; innovations, such as Lunchables and P3 in the United States, as well as solid foodservice gains in a number of key markets. As this happen, even though the United States continue to weight it down by lower shipments in nuts, cheese, meats and coffee, and the acceleration we expected in the rest-of-the-world market was held back by some one-off factors that David will discuss later, like the slowdown in Brazil and hurricanes in the Caribbean.","At EBITDA, momentum picked up as well. We delivered roughly 7% growth and 180 basis points of margin increase in Q3. The upside was driven by a combination of, one, gains from our cost-saving initiatives, including $125 million from our North American Integration Program; two, lower overhead costs; and, three, favorable pricing. At adjusted EPS, we were flat with the prior year, as our strong EBITDA growth was offset by a roughly 450 basis point increase in the effective tax rate versus Q3 last year. Going forward, as I mentioned, we do expect business momentum to continue into the fourth quarter, with strong gains at both EBITDA and EPS.","Now I will hand it over to George, Paulo, and David to highlight our performance and our outlook in each reporting segment. But before I do, I would like to thank my partner, George, for the contributions he has already made leading our West (10:21) business through a period of significant transformation, and to say that I look forward to continuing to work together for even bigger and better contributions to the Kraft Heinz Company. George remains a part of Kraft Heinz, and he will be deeply involved in our innovation and brand-building initiatives, our regular performance review, as well as the development and execution of our strategic plan. So, again, thank you, George.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you very much, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, I will start the update for our U.S. business on slide 4. Overall, we continued to move in the right direction during the third quarter. We leveraged Kraft Heinz's scale at retail with a well-executed Labor Day event. We're seeing solid consumption gains in a number of our largest categories, including continued growth in our frozen business, Kraft American slices and Heinz Ketchup, as well as innovation-led growth from Lunchables and P3, and our renovation of Oscar Mayer hot dogs driving improved category performance.","Our share performance has remained consistent overall, continuing with positive share trends in roughly half the business in measured channels, despite the strong private label push that you've seen in the past few quarters. In outside measured channels, in Q3, we began once again to deliver faster than market growth in foodservice and our e-commerce sales are up more than 70% year-to-date. That's not to say that we don't still have some market share and consumption challenges.","But they remain concentrated in the same few categories we've been talking about for some time, and we understand what needs to be fixed. They include cold cuts, which continues to be a largely self-inflicted problem with delays in new equipment start-up that will, in fact, impact Q4 merchandising, sales and market share; natural cheese, where shares remain under pressure due to increasing price gaps to private label; and, finally, ongoing weakness in our Kraft salad dressing business.","Overall, the fact that we're building momentum as we take significant steps to transform our U.S. business gives me comfort and confidence in handing the business off to my partner and friend, Paulo. So for the outlook, let me pass the baton to Paulo.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm very excited to be leading the U.S. business, and I feel good about our ability to continue delivering profitable growth, despite the fact we must keep adapting to a rapidly-changing retail environment. I think, the challenges we face and the actions we need to take are clear and straightforward.","It centers on capturing several opportunities we have to drive better consumption trends, including leverage data to make our marketing as effective as possible from marketing mix to quality impressions, executing our strong pipeline of innovation and renovation, sharpening our category management skills through revenue management and assortment management capabilities, continue to invest in sales to ensure we have the right product range at the right account in the right geography, as well as ramping up our efforts outside traditional channels to capture incremental growth opportunities including foodservice and e-commerce.","In the near term, I expect that we will see many of the same underlying trends that George described for the third quarter continue to play out in the fourth quarter, and positioning ourselves for a solid 2018, including the completion of our footprint initiatives is a key priority.","But let me turn it over to David to better frame what we've seen and what to expect within the numbers.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Paulo, and hello, everyone. I'll start on slide 5 with our U.S. financials. As expected, organic net sales performance continued to improve in Q3 to a 0.4% decline. Volume\/mix performance was in line with what we saw in Q2.To the plus side were consumption-led growth in Lunchables and P3, gains in foodservice and a roughly 30 basis point benefit from hurricane-related consumer pantry loading. But these were more than offset by distribution losses in nuts and cheese, as well as lower shipments in meats and coffee.","By contrast, pricing began to come through stronger in Q3, reflecting higher prices in cheese and bacon to address rising commodity costs, as well as pricing in desserts that were partially offset by the timing of promotional activity versus last year in a number of categories, including Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages.","We also saw stronger EBITDA performance in Q3 than either Q2 or the first half, with adjusted EBITDA up 6.8%. As Bernardo mentioned, incremental Integration Program savings of $125 million between the U.S. and Canada was a key contributor. Beyond Integration Program savings, lower overhead costs and favorable pricing were partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, particularly in meats and cheese. On our last call, Paulo talked about a better balance of pricing and key commodity costs in the second half versus what we saw in the first half. While this did, in fact, happen, it was less pronounced than anticipated, due to a step-up in dairy and bacon costs during the quarter.","Going forward, there are a couple of factors that will impact U.S. performance in Q4. Organic sales growth in Q4 will see a 30 basis point headwind from hurricane-related consumer pantry loading in Q3; as George mentioned, delayed production line start-ups impacting cold cuts; as well as the fact that we're up against the strong 2016 fourth quarter that included some degree of retail inventory build that we don't expect to repeat this year. That said, we do expect solid EBITDA growth to continue, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable sales, as well as further cost savings that I'll speak to later.","Let's turn to slide 6 and Canada, where in the third quarter we continued to see our focus on profitable sales pay off. Pricing largely reflected increased promotional activity versus the prior year, as we're essentially seeing 12 months of merchandising activity being fit into the last nine months of this year. This is due to the delay in reaching go-to-market agreements with key retailers in Q1. Volume\/mix mainly reflected ongoing consumption growth in condiments and sauces that was offset by lower shipments of mac and cheese versus the prior year.","At EBITDA, similar to the U.S., we had solid mid-single-digit constant-currency growth and more than 200 basis points of margin expansion. Here, gains from cost savings and lower overhead costs, as well as improved product mix, more than offset the impact of lower pricing from higher promotional costs versus the prior year.","Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a similar picture to Q3 on the top line with solid underlying growth and a good level of in-store activity. However, with the strong headwind in December as we expect to end 2017 with lower retail inventory levels than seen at the end of Q4 last year. At EBITDA, grocery continue to improve from a combination of cost savings and a better balance of pricing and input costs versus the prior year.","That brings us to Europe on slide 7, where we saw a very solid quarter. Pricing was sequentially better than Q2, but continued to be weighed down by trade investments to address competitive activity in our Italian infant nutrition business. Volume\/mix improved to 4.1% growth, driven by strong consumption gains in condiments and sauces across the region, as well as gains in foodservice, although there was a small benefit within all of this from shipment phasing versus last year as we mentioned on our last call. Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the UK gives us the confidence that the business is on the right path.","At EBITDA, we continued to benefit from volume\/mix gains and strong efforts to control costs, and this more than offset unfavorable input costs in local currency driven by transactional currency headwinds. Going forward, in Europe, we don't expect organic sales growth in Q4 to be quite as robust as Q3 due to a combination of program timing and comparisons. However, we do expect to see a combination of organic net sales growth and cost efficiencies continue to drive EBITDA growth.","Finally, let's look at our Rest of World segment on slide eight. Clearly, the 3.6% organic net sales growth was not the acceleration we had expected and remains a lower rate of growth than we would expect on an ongoing basis. We did see strong, double-digit gains in markets like Indonesia, China, and the Middle East, driven by the focused investments we've been making to drive condiments and sauces, as well as our Planters nut businesses, and this was very much in line with our expectations.","That said, for the second quarter in a row, a number of one-off factors contributed to this performance, including an unfavorable impact from distributor network realignment, which we have seen in the past couple of quarters, but should begin to fade as Q4 progresses. We also saw lower shipments in Brazil as we've seen a general slowdown in the market, but most acutely impacting our canned vegetable business in the quarter, even though we continued to grow market share. In addition, Q3 was further held back by overhang from the GST change in India, primarily impacting our nutritional beverages business and to a lesser extent lost sales due to the hurricane impact in the Caribbean.","At EBITDA, we saw the solid underlying growth I mentioned, together with the tight focus on costs show up at the EBITDA line. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% in constant currency terms in the quarter and margin is now moving in a positive direction, consistent with the expectations we laid out on our last call. Going forward, we do expect the impact of the one-off factors I mentioned to fade in Q4 with organic sales reaccelerating, and this should happen despite a headwind from Chinese New Year-related shipments shifting into Q1 2018 due to a later-than-normal holiday. We also expect to better leverage the investments we've been making over the past year, driving stronger growth in EBITDA.","This brings us to our outlook for the total company. I'll start by picking up on the sentiment Bernardo laid out earlier that while our numbers have not been as strong as they could have been, the impact our investments are making in the marketplace and our P&L are building the positive momentum we expect and need to continue delivering sustainable profitable growth. Our focus from here is to close out the year strong and make sure that we continue to make progress against the things that will drive positive momentum in 2018. This should play out on three fronts.","First, seeding and growing organic sales. In the U.S., this means executing our strong pipeline of innovation, renovation, marketing, and go-to-market initiatives. In Canada, to sustain the recovery in our activities at retail, as well as innovation-driven gains in our grocery portfolio; in Europe, to continue improving our share performance where we currently compete as well as capturing the whitespace in front of us including the repatriation of the Kraft brands; and for rest of world growth to accelerate with the return to run rate performance in both our EMEA and Latin America regions, each driven by a combination of innovation and whitespace gains.","Second, continuing to build profit momentum. On cost savings, we're now targeting between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017, or $500 million to $600 million of net incremental savings in 2017 versus 2016. Ramping up supply chain related savings will be a key factor. We're confident that the savings are there, it's more a matter of timing relative to the end of the year.","Another factor at work will be business momentum picking up in the form of sequentially better organic net sales growth in the areas where we've been investing the heaviest and the levers that provides at the EBITDA line.","And finally, we continue to expect a more favorable balance between pricing and input costs as we go forward with Q4 sequentially better than the third quarter.","The third and final part of our outlook is below the line costs, specifically the tax line. Based on the flow of discrete items we've seen through Q3 and what we're forecasting for Q4, we now expect our full year 2017 effective tax rate to land at approximately 29% versus the 30% we think is representative of our run rate on an annual basis.","All things considered, we remain confident that a strong earnings profile should continue to show through, driven by a combination of profitable organic sales and EBITDA growth.","Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Excuse the background noise. I'm actually on the road. When you talk about the U.S. food market, retailing environment getting more difficult, I think there's quite a few versions of what that might mean these days. There's a lot of theories and problems that people have cited. Could you zero in on what has gotten more difficult in the U.S. food market in general this year in terms of having profitable sustainable growth? And I'll have a follow-up. Thanks.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, David. This is Georges here. I'll take the question. There's no doubt that there is a change in the retail landscape today, and a change in the retail landscape is not something new. What is new is the frequency and the speed at which the market is changing.","So we are seeing the majority \u2013 the vast majority of retailers investing to provide consumers with more shopping options. So we see almost everyone now trying at some stage in the cycle to offer in-store pickup, delivery to home, and people coming and shopping inside their stores as usual.","Our job is to be agile enough to deliver the relevant offering and the bundle that consumers \u2013 that caters to consumers' shopping options. That's what we need to do, and that's where we're making the majority of our investments. For us, it is not a question that, for instance, we have to choose between an e-commerce versus a traditional channel. It is operating in every channel effectively, and that's the job to be done. And that's the job that we are focusing on.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And does that creeping influence of e-commerce mean less pricing power? Or just simply that there is a desire from some of the bricks and mortar players for you to share in those investments? Is that simply what's happening going on right now?","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Well, for us the contribution margin from the sales in the e-commerce channel are comparable to the traditional channel because the physical movement of product is the same from us to the customers. Where we are making the investment, however, we're making an outsized investment to build our capability for the pull factor because the way consumers shop when they are in front of a screen, or they're using the mobile commerce, or they're using the voice commerce, is very different to their shopping behavior when they are walking through the aisle. And so our focus to making an investment to be able to cater for that and stimulate demand for us and our trading partners. So we will see that investment catching \u2013 the return catching up once we build scale in this area.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. One quick one from me and then a broader one. I think it was implied last \u2013 on last quarter's call, and maybe stated absolutely that it was expected that sequentially organic growth would improve throughout the year, so 4Q would probably be better than 3Q. David, I think, you've been talking about some of the headwinds that we might face in 4Q versus 3Q, but we have a much easier comp as well in organic sales growth. Do we still believe it is still reasonable to expect that organic sales growth for the whole company will be a little bit better in the fourth quarter than the third quarter?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi Ken. This is David. And thank you for the question. So to summarize my comments from earlier, I'd say in Q4 we'd expect organic sales to reflect two things. One, some one-off headwinds from the U.S. and Canada, but we do expect this to be offset by acceleration in rest of the world. So I think that's kind of the trajectory you would expect for organic sales. The other thing I would say is we continue to expect strong EBITDA growth globally into Q4.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","And, Ken, just to mention on Q4, keep in mind that organic net sales growth was up 1.6% last year. So it's not necessarily an easy comp.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, you're right. I was looking at the wrong year, and I apologize for that. My larger question in terms of personnel changes, obviously there have been some fairly major ones lately at the top. Can \u2013 I just \u2013 not to take up too much time, but can we just ask a little bit about why some of these changes were made? What, Bernardo, you think that individual strengths are in terms of David and Paolo and George, and why they are right for these roles? I'm just trying to get a little bit of a sense for why at this company's life cycle, or this point in the life cycle, these movements were taken on?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken, it's Bernardo. I think, it's a really good question. And if you think about it, we thought it was really the right timing to do that given that if you take the whole integration after two years of Kraft Heinz was already behind us, we went into a lot of transformational steps, not only from a result standpoint, but a way of doing business, pushing a large speed to market, to innovation go-to-market, and other things, a lot of different campaigns to products and renovation.","And George has really done a phenomenal job leading us in the U.S. during this whole period. And part of his job as well was to prepare other players that could be his successor in this, and he could be helping us in a different role, what he is going to be doing that to myself, to Paulo, to the Board and so on.","I think, for Paulo, after leading the finance world from this whole period since the acquisition of Heinz in 2013 was really a phenomenal opportunity for running a business and really adding to his skills and the talent he has. He understands the business better than anybody else. He had to work side-by-side with George, with myself during this whole period.","So I wouldn't say I know people take by surprise, but the way you write this, it's very normal for us to have people in different areas and rotating and really adding to the business for the long run.","And, David, it's really a question of, it's really a result of talent and proven results from the past, be now taking from a different \u2013 completely different role being the CFO of the company. I think, it's a great proof of meritocracy and ownership in action. So I know, it was a lot bundled together, but in the sense that something has been built for quite some time, has been \u2013 the transition has been very smooth. And really Paulo is already running the business, but David is already the CFO. George is already helping me in several initiatives like he was mentioning the e-commerce, the channel mix, things related to innovation, related to our stock plan initiatives. So I would say it's really a proof of meritocracy and speed to market when we move the company to the next level.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for the questions. I just had two. First I guess for David or for Paulo. I just wanted to ask about gross margin in the quarter. It was a bit below our expectations. I'd assume the main driver of any shortfall that might've occurred relative to your own outlook was a function of that price cost balance improving a little bit less than expected. But apart from that dynamic, could you just talk about the balance between supporting the brands with trade versus advertising at the moment? Are you seeing any incremental pressure from competitive dynamics, or retailers, that's resulting in the need to reallocate a bit of money from brand building back toward trade spending?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Matt. This is David, and thank you for the question here. So to answer your question, I think there are a few things to note on how the P&L is playing versus last year. So on gross margin, as you asked, the performance versus last year really reflects two factors. So first, we've seen an unfavorable balance in pricing and commodities, with commodity inflation that we've talked about in first half and last quarter. I'll reiterate that we did see improvement in Q3, and we expect to see an accelerated improvement in this balance into Q4. And in fact with that improvement in Q4, it should enable better flow through of savings \u2013 of our integration savings to the bottom line to EBITDA.","The second factor here to highlight is we did have some increased depreciation and amortization expense within our gross margin line. If you actually take this out \u2013 and it's related to the footprint projects that we've talked about previously \u2013 if you take out this increase, our gross margin actually increased in Q3 by 35 basis points. So again, we started to see the improvement in Q3 which we expect to improve with PNOC and into Q4.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, David. That's helpful. And then just one other question, I guess following up on David Palmer's question earlier. When we're thinking about the pace of change in the U.S., there's been a huge amount of focus on the expansion of a few small but growing retailers within the food landscape, like Amazon and the hard discounters. And a lot of the risk factors being discussed are much more forward-looking than something that's really imminent or having a significant tangible impact right now, or at least it seems to be that way. So just curious to get your thoughts on what kind of tangible impact you're seeing from those retailers and how they are sort of interacting with broader industry at the moment. And then how well-positioned you are to partner with them, or in the case of the hard discounters how confident you are in remaining competitively resilient as they try and expand their presence.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi. This is Paulo. So when you think about the system discount \u2013 the high discounters channel, what we're seeing \u2013 and it's correct. We're seeing a push by this channel. It's causing a minute focus on product assortment and price matching by the traditional retailers.","Our objective here, it's clear for us, is we need to get the right SKUs, the right brands at the right price point that should go for development channel. So for us, again, just pretty much the same idea we have in terms of the new \u2013 when you think about the e-commerce, and the new digital world. It's pretty much not a question of, for instance, discounters versus other channels, but again be able to operate with the right assortment, with the right SKU, at the right price point with the discounters and with the other channels. I think that's our main job here today.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Paulo.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks. I guess a couple of questions. One is you raised your cost savings target, but my recollection is that that's also net of other costs that you might incur, inflationary costs such as freight. And with freight rising, how did that factor into your decision to raise the savings? Would it have been even higher excluding that, I guess? And then the second question is, I thought I heard Paulo comment about price matching by traditional retailers, or maybe I misunderstood. But is that a function of traditional grocers trying to match what the hard discounters are putting out there? And that's really my question.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Rob, this is David. And thanks for the question. So to answer it, I think this increase in integration savings that we saw from the $1.7 billion to a range from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Again, this is net of some of the inflation and investments we talked about, so that's an all-in number.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So it would've been higher, but are you raising your freight number in there also? Would it have been higher...","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Again, this is an all-in number, so it's net of some of the inflation investments that we've had.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Okay.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, in terms of the \u2013 sorry. Your second question about price matching. So we're seeing some private label matching between retailers that are creating a bigger and wider gap versus the branded product for some specific customers.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon, everybody.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hey, Bryan.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good afternoon.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi. So I guess my question is just around the EBITDA performance year-to-date, right. So I think currency \u2013 constant currency adjusted EBITDA is up 2% versus last year through the first three quarters. So can you give us a sense of where that stacks up versus, I guess, what your internal plans are? And also, I guess, there is an implication that EBITDA growth will be a little bit better in the fourth quarter, but just kind of where you are tracking versus plan? And I guess related to that, SG&A was pretty low this quarter, so trying to get a sense \u2013 I guess, some sense in there about how much of that is sustainable? Or are there some factors that drove SG&A down in the quarter that we should think about maybe not repeating?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Brian. It's Bernardo. Let me take the first part of your question about the performance evaluation, and then I'm going to ask David to follow-up on the SG&A piece. I think it's reasonable to say that after the first quarter that that has been a weaker quarter for us and for the industry in general, right? And we have been significantly progressed, month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, and when you compare the second half with the first half, we continue to make core progress in almost all geographies and all channels, right?","That's something we have been highlighting on calls. George has talked about that several times as well, and we are pleased to see that coming, right? So when you see our profitable growth agenda to mean investments of big bet innovations, go-to-market, digital growth, whitespace food service, efficiencies on the marketing side. They are all materializing, right? And it's gaining momentum as we speak. So we are pleased to see that.","On other hand, you're right to say that we have some short-term headwinds that really doesn't \u2013 that doesn't change the growth potential and the way we are seeing 2018 and beyond. And you're also right to say that we should continue to see the acceleration of our EBITDA growth looking fourth quarter, right? Especially with the savings curve materializing the way we wanted them to do it.","We finalizing our footprint initiatives, we are raising our all-in base of the savings, so we should see more of that in the fourth quarter, especially in the bottom line worldwide. With that, I will pass to David here to comment on specific on the numbers.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, Bernardo. And hi, Bryan, thank you for the question. So on the SG&A line, I'd say we did see a significant decline versus prior year as a percentage of sales, and that really reflects lower people cost that we've seen, as well as ZBB savings versus prior year. The one thing I want to note to address your question is as you update your models, you should not straight-line the SG&A as a percentage of sales like you saw on year-to-date in Q4 \u2013 or sorry, year-to-date in Q3 into Q4, because we do have some seasonality in this line item.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And just to be clear, in SG&A, has there been any change in like comp accruals? Have you had to take down comp accruals at all this year, because you're tracking behind plan? Or has that been a factor in the lower SG&A, I guess?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. So I'd say if you think about EBITDA for the year \u2013 sorry, for Q3 globally, we saw strong EBITDA growth up $120 million to $130 million. That was really driven by two things. One, cost savings in North America, as well as growth in Europe and rest of the world. So if you look at North America, we're actually up $100 million, and the difference there, the $30 million, is really driven by Europe and rest of world.","So in North America, we have the benefit of $125 million of integration savings. The delta there, the $100 million growth in EBITDA, was really driven by the unfavorable balance of pricing commodities that we talked about, which did improve in Q3, but was still had one for us, and that was partially offset by savings in the business. So that's kind of the rough trajectory of EBITDA versus prior year.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. You may begin.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. One question for George and one for Bernardo, please. So, George, we hear a lot from the retailers that private brands are growing, that the good retailers are there, Wegmans, Costco, H-E-B are the ones that tend to have very more developed private label programs and that others may want to catch up. Do you see that? Do you expect that? And how does it affect your business?","And then the question for Bernardo, and it's a bit philosophical. I would argue that a lot of your categories, Bernardo, are what I'd call more like commodity type nature whether it's cheese, cold cuts, even coffee, your brands are more on the commodity side, if I look at Maxwell House. So how do you adapt that portfolio? A, do you buy other brands' new categories? Do you enter licensing agreements with brands that are stronger? Or do you even enter private brands as a business?","And I say that because your skill set, there are some questions on the marketing side, but I'm sure your skills are there, but your skill set clearly is on scale, in operations, in cost savings. So given this new retail landscape, why not make a bigger bet on private brands and operate private brands as well as you manage your own brands, have more scale and maybe help margins. Thanks. Maybe, George, you can answer the first question first. Thanks.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Pablo. I will answer the first question, and I will hand it over to Bernardo to answer the second one. You are right. This year, we have seen, after a long period of being flat, a renewed focus on expanding the total distribution points or the TDPs of private label and some push on promoting private labels as well. And major part, that was to ensure a competition with new entrants expanding in the marketplace.","Now, the impact on us varied by category. In some categories, we benefited because to make way for the increase in total distribution points, some of the brands were taken out of the categories, and therefore the category performance improved when retailer reduced the number of offering of low-velocity product and went into high-velocity products. So you see that very noticeable in our ketchup business, in our Kraft American slices business, in our beverages mixes business, and our ready-to-eat dessert business.","On the other hand, by contrast, when retailers did not play with the assortment, but they resorted to price matching and having a very competitive private label with the expanding discounting sector, the gap between the branded and non-branded pricing expanded. And in those categories, we saw loss of market share. An example for that is the natural cheese. At the end of the day, we still manage to have about 50% of the business maintaining or growing share, and we will continue to invest in the quality and innovation and renovation and advertising to win in the marketplace across all our major categories. So that's where we landed. Bernardo?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Pablo. Bernardo. About your questions about what you call more commoditized categories, and so, I think it's important to highlight two things. One, those are categories that you have been doing a lot of good work on renovation and bringing things to market on a different way, right. I think the hotdog example is a good example. The innovation in Planters Signature nutrition and others is another good example.","On the cheese category with several different offerings within \u2013 from Philadelphia, but to the natural cheese and singles. It's another. So \u2013 and those are categories which \u2013 that are really very, very \u2013 tend to be extremely profitable, with high margins in all them. So in order to make this analysis we're making, I think it's good to see the profitability and the way to go to the category in a more longer-term view, right? That's always help.","The second piece to our question, that we tend to like more the scale and then the things that you're going to need investment in growth. I tend to disagree with that because if you look the story of the last two years since the merger, we were able to really achieve significantly margin increase within our business, keeping the same level of growth as our peers. Now recently, looking at 2017, in most parts of the categories we are growing better than our peers. Right? Because of the agenda looking at innovation, the go-to-market, the marketing, the digital channels, the foodservice whitespace and so on.","So even though I believe and we said that in the call many times, you have much more ahead of us not only for the year, looking into fourth quarter against third quarter and so on, but looking 2018, 2019 and beyond. Many of the categories we have today, we're in a much better place as we speak, and George have been highlighting that, than you were a year ago or two years ago. What make us excited about the momentum were coming and looking at 2018 and 2019.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. You may begin.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks very much. This morning, there was an article in The London Telegraph about a number of leading CPG companies who are participating in a pilot exchange that effectively cuts out \u2013 potentially cuts out some major retailers. And I guess, it's \u2013 it got me thinking, why isn't it \u2013 what stops something like that from happening in North America or more broadly? And what got me thinking, why is it inherently margin negative for retailers to fragment?","You named \u2013 you just named some brands that have performed very, very well as retailers have been forced to reset shelves. Why isn't that the case that there's ways to go more direct to consumers; maybe partner more aggressively with existing e-commerce players to create not only \u2013 not only create a more rational market, but create greater leverage for your brands and for yourself? Especially in those businesses where you have high brand share, high penetration and the high can't-live-without-it factor for retailers? Just your thoughts on that. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Jonathan. When we reviewed our e-commerce strategy as we built the team, we looked at all options, and we felt and we decided that the most efficient option from an end-to-end supply chain is to partner with retailers because of the scale that they provide for everybody. And we decided that for the physical movement of product, we keep using central distribution warehouses to get the physical movement of product to retailers and our investment is better made to build a relationship with the consumers and convert these consumers as customers of our trade partners. And this is where we're investing the money, this is where we're putting our resources. And from the pilot that we did, and we had a number of initiatives that we tested in the marketplace, it proved very efficient, profitable, and can deliver growth for both of us, ourselves and our major customers.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup. You may begin.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Good evening, everyone. I had two questions. The first was just a follow-up to David regarding the changes to the asset \u2013 the asset footprint. You said something earlier about if you excluded the higher depreciation that gross margins would have been up. And the only thing I'd like you to explain is that I thought the concept is that you put all this new fancy equipment in because it gives you lower operating costs. One of the negatives, of course, is higher depreciation for the brand-new equipment. But isn't there a significant positive because there's lower operating costs? So if you take that part into account, can you still do the margin computation that you gave us saying that ex the depreciation, gross margin would've been up?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, David. Thank you for the question. So I think to answer your question, like I said, we had an increase in depreciation related to the footprint which if you strip this out we would've had increasing gross margin of 35 basis points. So I think the disconnect there is really timing related relative to the ramp up that we would see in some of these programs relative to the CapEx that we have to spend.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Europe. You guys mentioned that you are taking back some of the licenses, or the licenses that reverted back from Mondelez. Can you spend a little bit more time and talk about this? I think this can have a reasonably significant impact over time. But I would like to hear exactly what brands have come back or what products have come back to you and what are your plans going forward to enhance your European business with these licenses?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, David. It's Bernardo. That's correct. We came to an agreement with the Mondelez and had the brands that were under Kraft name actually, and Bull's-Eye another brands within continued to come back to us this fourth quarter. What really, I think, allowed us to already start talking to retailers and to plan properly 2018 and accelerate our plans moving forward. We are excited with that because, especially the Continental Europe get us more and more presence in scale in condiments and sauces business, that's for sure a category that's strategic for us and one that we want to expand our presence worldwide within that and that happens.","We did do a discussion, when you look at Germany, Italy, Spain, and some other countries within Continental Europe. By having the brands now, like I said, allowed us to really move at a faster pace to our plans already for next year. The biggest product next year that's coming back is really Kraft Mayo, but we also have to have other sauces in barbecue, even ketchup, and others that are also coming back with the repatriation of the brands especially on the Kraft name.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you give us any sense of scale as to what revenue this will contribute next year?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","We are not giving the numbers now for sure. We're working the plans what this can be. I think the first step is really to have them in-house and really establishing and keeping the commercial relationship as it is today, and then from there you're going to see what can be growing and how we can scale to our distribution and so on. It will be more looking at through second half next year when you can have them completely in-house the way we would like to, but I would say it's a good start of the process.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much. I'll pass it along.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Great. If we could take one more question, that would be great.","Operator","Our last question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may begin.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon. So I guess my one question is we've seen a pretty severe devaluation in the food space irrespective of the last day or so. And I guess as capital allocation is such a large part of KHC's story, I guess I was wondering what you can comment on in terms of the company's ability to take advantage or monetize some of that \u2013 or some of these stock moves, and maybe use it to your advantage? And I guess, in other words, why wouldn't KHC be able to move faster on some of these capital allocation decisions in this kind of an environment where there would seem to be some additional opportunity?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Andrew. It's Bernardo again. I think your question makes a lot of sense. I think it's important just without commenting on any specific or hypothetical names, or to say that our framework has really not changed within the M&A strategy and capital allocation. Your right to say I don't think it's a question of speed or not speed. We have proven in the past that we are disciplined and know how to allocate capital, and we have proven in the past also that we know how to be fast when applicable. I think it's coming back to the framework, the three things we have been saying for quite some time are still in place today in an important way.","First, we do like brands that can travel, not only through geographies but to all channels. That's an important consideration for us. Second, we do like good categories and business that we believe can be sustainable for the long term. And third, the right valuation, the right value creation for the long-term is critical. When you find this combination that really allows us to say that two plus two is more than four, we can't move at a fast pace one when we can. We can add to our portfolio and really create within a Kraft science project something bigger, again when you find the two plus two, that's more than four. Your question about the right valuation what's happening in the market, that doesn't change our long-term perspective and our framework. You are right to say that the companies at those valuations and so really create a much more long-term value creation to the captor if they fit the framework. You are right to say so.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much for your perspective.","Operator","Thank you.

Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hello everyone, and thanks for joining our business update for the second quarter of 2017. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO, Paulo Basilio, our CFO, and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you could find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now, let's turn to slide 2 and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and hello, everyone. To begin our review today, it's important to recognize that clearly not everything went our way in the first half. Canada, India and commodity cost in United States are just a few examples. But given all that's going on in our industry at the moment, it is good to report that we remain on track with all our overall plans and confident that we will gain additional business momentum in the second half of the year. This is because we continue to make progress against our agenda for 2017 in the three objectives of our long-term strategy.","On the top line, while we are not satisfied with our first half numbers, we are not discouraged with our ability to drive sequential improvement in organic sales and deliver our 2017 plan for profitable growth. So far in the year, our Big Bets and whitespace initiatives from last year have been the main driver and that's very encouraging for the perspective of sustainable growth. George will speak to that for the United States.","Outside the U.S., we're this play out through positive investment-driven consumption trends, driven by our condiments and sauces portfolio, in Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Middle East. At the same time, we have been laying the groundwork to capture additional whitespace opportunities. That includes the significant commercial investment to drive top line growth in our EMEA region that we have spoken about before. It also includes our Latin American investment in people to increase distribution across traditional trade, modern trade and foodservice in Mexico, as well as expand our distribution footprint in South America. So overall, we believe we have a strong pipeline to drive profitable sales growth going forward. I","In terms of our goal to establish industry-leading margins, we remain on track with our cost savings initiatives. Our total savings so far in 2017 have been stronger than expected. Cumulative savings from our Integration Program were approximately $1.45 billion at the end of the second quarter. And all three areas of our program are contributing: renovation structure, ZBB and procurement, and manufacturing footprint. It's true that we have had known key commodity costs as a headwind so far in 2017. More important, however, we are improving execution in all areas of the business. In operations, we have either kept or enhanced our K-through rate, safety and product quality metrics.","In marketing, we are supporting our brands with a greater number of quality advertising impressions. At the same time, we have invested to build new in-house ultra market capabilities such as revenue management and assortment management with objectives of driving these capabilities globally.","Finally, on the capital structure front, in the second quarter, we took additional actions to deliver superior return of capital and continued to strengthen our balance sheet. As we previously said and consistent with our commitment to an investment grade credit rating, we paid down $2 billion of debt within two years of closing the merger of Kraft and Heinz. And as you saw today, our board of directors set a 4.2% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.625 per share or $2.50 on an annual basis. That's a broad overview of where we stand after the second quarter of 2017. And consistent with our plan, we remain in a good position for profitable top line growth and EBITDA gains to drive solid EPS growth for the full year.","Let's turn now to slide 3 to review the details of our Q2 financial results. As it relates to today's company sales, there are two things to highlight. First, sequentially better organic net sales performance driven by volume\/mix improvements in the United States, Canada and Europe. And our volume\/mix did improve despite some significant headwinds in our Rest of the World markets that Paulo will discuss later. Second, pricing was sequentially lower due to promotional timing in the United States and Canada.","At EBITDA, quite simple, our second quarter results reflected the strong incremental cost saving initiatives, primarily from the $180 million of incremental savings delivered by our North America Integration Program. And these savings more than offset several headwinds including higher key commodity costs in North America, lower net sales as well as investments in the Rest of the World markets behind growth initiatives.","At adjusted EPS, we still see strong growth mainly driven by the refinancing of the preferred stock as well as some tax favorability. Going forward, as I mentioned, we expect to continue our business improvement in the second half of 2017 with the combination of profitable top line growth and EBITDA to be the main drivers of EPS growth for the full year.","Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to highlight our performance in each reporting segment and what to expect in each area going forward. George?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you. Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and our performance in the United States. To start, you will note that we did not provide the consumption bridge for the U.S. that we have in the past. This is due to a growing divergence between our sales performance and measured-channel data and our desire to provide you with a clear, concise picture of how we are doing. While it's true that we're operating in a challenging and rapidly changing environment, we do not believe that our challenges are to the degree that measured-channel data currently suggest. What is clear is that we had a sequential improvement in net sales from Q1 to Q2.","So as Bernardo said, while we're not satisfied with our numbers, we are not discouraged with our ability to drive sequential improvement either. In the second quarter, we started to see better leverage of Kraft Heinz scale at retail in the form of increased in-store activity, with several scale events including Easter, Memorial Day and our Feed Your Family, Feed The World cause-related event. We're also seeing solid consumption gains in a number of our largest categories, including strong growth in our frozen business after years of decline behind the introductions of Devour and SmartMade brands, as well as solid performance in frozen snacks, ongoing growth in our Kraft American Slices, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Oscar Mayer Bacon portfolios from recent renovation and innovation as well as innovation-led growth in the on-the-go arena from Lunchables and P3. And we are encouraged that our share performance was stable overall considering a back half weighted set of initiatives.","That's not to say that some consumption challenges remain, but they are concentrated in few categories: natural cheese, mainly due to aggressive competitive pricing in the category; cold cuts as we rebuild our end market distributions and resume merchandising after the self-imposed restriction due to capacity constraints during 2016; and finally ongoing weakness in salad dressings.","Another factor that gives us confidence in strengthening our performance at retail going forward is the fact that we are enhancing our capabilities in a number of disciplines, including revenue management as a platform for more informed, data-driven decision making to support our efforts to drive category growth, assortment management to ensure we're getting right product range at the right account in the right geography, as well as ramping up our e-commerce efforts, where we saw more than 60% growth in Q2, albeit from a base of roughly 1% of our U.S. retail sales. In addition, roughly 70% of our footprint-related production line startups were completed by the end of the second quarter, and more is happening as we speak.","So, moving forward, we continue to believe we can drive sequential improvement and profitable organic growth from Q2 to the second half of the year. At retail, we expect to further leverage our scale for better in-store activity going forward and more of it in Q3. We also have a strong pipeline of innovation, renovation and communication to drive improved back-half consumption trends in key categories and some of our more challenged categories. In Q3 alone, you will see robust support of Capri Sun Sport and Capri Sun Organic, more activity in our meals business including Cracker Barrel Oven Baked Mac & Cheese as well as the second half of grilling season with our renovated line of Oscar Mayer Hot Dogs.","With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide 5 with our U.S. financials. As expected, we delivered a sequential improvement in organic net sales performance, a 1.2% decline from a 3.5% decline in Q1. This was driven by sequentially better volume\/mix performance that reflected the Easter shift, which added roughly 40 basis points of growth versus the prior year, as well as solid gains in our frozen, mac & cheese and condiments. We also continued to see volume\/mix headwinds from distribution losses of certain products in measured channels, primarily club that affected our consumption numbers in cheese and meat, as well as lower shipments in foodservice, but we expect these two areas to improve as the year progresses. On the pricing front, lower pricing in Q2 reflected a combination of higher price in cheese, mainly to address a rise in daily curve that was more than offset by a negative impact from the timing of trade promotion recognition in the prior year.","Moving to EBITDA, our second quarter EBITDA was up 3.2% and EBITDA margin rose 140 basis points. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by incremental integration savings that amounted to roughly $180 million between the U.S. and Canada. And this more than offset unfavorable key commodity costs, particularly cheese and coffee in both retail and foodservice channels that continued to hold back gains in Q2. I will note here that roughly $40 million of the cost savings we realized in Q2 were due to the timing of overhead, and other costs versus the prior year. And looking forward, this will likely mean that we see a lower level of incremental savings in Q3 relative to Q2.","Let's turn to slide 6. In Canada, where in the second quarter, we saw foreign exchange headwinds return, but this momentum began to resume. Volume\/mix gains reflected resumption of normal retail activity during Q2, as well as a strong consumption growth in condiments and sauces. These gains were somewhat offset by the discontinuation of select cheese products at retail. Our volume\/mix headwind, that we expect to be a factor again in Q3. In terms of pricing, lower pricing in the second quarter, largely reflected an increase in promotional activity versus the prior year.","At EBITDA, we had both growth and margin expansion resume in Q2. Constant currency EBITDA was up 2.3% and EBITDA margin was up roughly 150 basis points versus Q2 last year. This was driven by incremental cost savings that were partially offset by the impact from an increasing promotional activity. Importantly, our second quarter performance in Canada shows that the go-to-market agreements achieved with our key retailers are in fact a win-win proposition and it can drive profitable growth going forward. As a result, we remain confident that we will continue to see improving trends in the growth and profitability of our Canadian business during the second half of the year.","That brings us to Europe on slide 7, where we also saw sequential improvement in volume\/mix growth. Similar to Q1, strong currency headwinds continued to be a factor in the results, and pricing declined due to the timing of promotional activity in the U.K., as well as trade investments to address competitive activity in our Italian infant nutritional business. Volume\/mix improved, driven by strong consumption gains in condiments and sauces, as well as gains in foodservice and this came despite the headwind from shipment phasing last year that we mentioned on our last call.","Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the U.K. give us the confidence that the business is on the right track. EBITDA, we continue to benefit from volume\/mix gains and strong efforts to control costs, especially within manufacturing. However, this was more than offset by unfavorable input costs in local currency, driven by transactional currency headwinds, as well as the impact from lower pricing. Going forward in Europe, we expect to see profitable, investment-driven net sales growth as the key driver to EBITDA growth and this should come from both existing markets and categories as well as whitespace initiatives.","Finally, let's look at our Rest of the World segment on slide 8. In Q2, organic net sales growth decelerated to 3% from 8.1% growth in Q1, and a lower rate of growth than we would expect on an ongoing basis. What I would highlight here, however, is that more than a 100% of the quarter-to-quarter deceleration was due to two factors that we do not expect to repeat going forward. One, was a negative impact from the general sales tax regime in India, that you have heard a number of our global peers talk about recently. Two, was a holiday-related shipment timing in Indonesia related to the shift in the Ramadan holiday versus last year.","And unfortunately, these more than offset strong double-digit gains in China, Brazil and the Middle East as well as growth in condiments and sauces across most of our other markets. Going forward, we expect organic sales to reaccelerate as comparisons in Indonesia will ease and India should return to more normal shipment patterns with distributors. However, it's important to note that we are unlikely to regain the Q2 volume loss in India during the third quarter, mainly due to the seasonal nature of a part of our business.","At EBITDA, recall that our plan for 2017 is to invest aggressively in marketing, go-to-market capabilities and product development upfront and that this would hold back margin expansion versus the prior year. We saw these in Q1. In Q2, results continued to reflect significant commercial investments to drive growth in our EMEA region and to a lesser extent Latin America. However, the distinction I would make is that the decline in adjusted EBITDA this quarter primarily reflected a very strong margin comparison to the prior year. In fact, this quarter's EBITDA margin was at 21.2%, bringing us to 19.4% for the first half of the year, and just roughly one point below what we saw for the full year in 2016. Looking forward, we expect second half organic sales growth to accelerate from the first half levels, and better leverage the investments we've been making.","Which brings us to our outlook, I will echo what Bernardo and George said earlier. Despite a number of headwinds we faced in the first half and considering that we are operating in an increasingly challenging environment, we remain confident that we can improve our performance going forward. As we've said before, we expect sequentially better organic growth in the second half of 2017 versus the second quarter just reported. We have a strong pipeline of marketing, go-to-market and product quality initiatives to drive profitable organic growth, including further whitespace gains. We expect the sequential improvement in Canada to continue, driven by sustained recovery in our activities at retail as well as innovation driven gains in our grocery portfolio.","In our Rest of the World segment, we expect innovation and whitespace gains to drive accelerated growth in both EMEA and Latin America. On cost savings, we are still targeting $1.7 billion of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017, or $500 million of net incremental savings in 2017 versus 2016. As far as the timing of savings is concerned, we've achieved roughly $280 million of net incremental savings in the first half of the year and expect the remainder in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, so far this year, savings have come in stronger than anticipated. But at this point, we are not ready to call upside to the $500 million of net incremental savings for the year. Along these lines, I would also note that a combination of cost saving and the ramping up of footprint-related savings is likely to mean that we see less than half of the remaining 2017 incremental savings in Q3.","Turning to EBITDA and EPS, the obvious question is how we are going to drive strong EBITDA growth in the second half with less than half of our remaining 2017 incremental cost savings. The answer is, a combination of underlying business momentum and comparisons versus the prior year. In the first half just completed, our strong pace of cost savings resulted in a slight decline in constant currency adjusted EBITDA. This was due to slower business momentum in the form of rising key commodity costs, organic sales headwinds in Canada, Europe and India and upfront investments ahead of further innovation and whitespace expansion in our Rest of the World markets. It also reflected comparisons against our first half 2016 that benefited from strong favorable pricing net of key commodity costs in North America.","By contrast, the second half of 2017 should in many ways be a mirror image of the first half. We continue to expect a strong stream of cost savings, but our business momentum should be pick up significantly as we see sequentially better organic net sales growth leveraging the investments we've been making, as I just described. And comparisons versus the prior year should ease, reflecting a more favorable balance between pricing and input costs.","Finally, there is one housekeeping item I should mention related to tax. Given the favorability from discrete items we've seen through Q2, we now expect our full-year 2017 effective tax rate to fall between 29% and 30% versus the 30% we think is representative to our run rate on an annual basis. That said, our effective tax rate in Q3, will likely be higher than our full year run rate as we currently expect net discrete items turn unfavorable. All things considered, we remain confident that the strong earnings growth should continue in the second half of the year, driven by a combination of profitable organic sales growth and margin expansion.","Thank you. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. So, I'd say good job in Q2, I think the sequential improvement we saw from Q1 is obviously a positive. Just in terms of your expectation into further sequential improvement that's expected in the back half of the year, I guess one is, you've spoken to Q2 being better than Q1, and the back half being better than Q2, but is I guess, one, should Q3 be better than Q2 and Q4 be better than Q3? And then secondly, as you speak about your leveraging the scale in retail and the investments that you're making, just wondering if you could give us one or two explicit examples of what investments you are making and how some of the innovation has already been playing out well? Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Rob. This is Paulo, so in terms of the outlook, yeah, as I said, we're expecting sequentially better organic sales growth and our view is that and the call that we're having today is that we're seeing improvement in the second half versus our Q2 results. We're not breaking down this number for Q3 and Q4, but we expect today's improvement in the second half versus Q2 in terms of organic growth. Want to ask George to talk about the second question.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah, Rob, this is George Zoghbi. As far as the second half, we believe the performance will improve compared to Q1 and Q2, we'll continue to see sequential improvement driven mainly by three things. One is the innovation that we have launched early in the year is building up to a higher ACV and then we turn on the advertising behind it. Number two is the in-store execution. We expanded the business development team for in-store execution. And number three, we already announced a number of price increases to cover for the commodities that constituted headwinds for us in Q2, so the three actions here will help us for further sequential improvement in the second half of the year. I think the same is applicable for the Canadian business and the Rest of the World, in Europe and Latin America already doing better second quarter to continue their journey.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, everybody.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good afternoon.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, on the cost save side, it looks like you delivered pretty strong cost saves in the quarter, and I guess my question is I guess why didn't more of that translate I guess dollar to dollar into EBITDA and perhaps as part of that you can give us an idea of the shape of the year in that context?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. This is Paulo. So just to \u2013 let me break down the EBITDA in North America for you, so try to give more color on that. So our North America \u2013 we had $180 million of integration savings in the quarter in North America. Our EBITDA in North America grew approximately $62 million, okay? So the offsets that we had pretty much the first and the big one was the commodity unfavorability, $80 million roughly, again against a significant favorability we had in the prior year on that line. And approximately $40 million in sales performance that being the majority of that coming from the timing of trading accruals, as we said, that we expect to have the benefit in the second half.","When you think about the savings, so just to give the reasons why we had a lot of offsets on the savings to the EBITDA. When you go the second question about the savings, I can tell you that now even discounting the $40 million related to the timing of overhead expenses, it's correct, our savings are coming in faster than expected. But also \u2013 and we are seeing more gross savings coming in that inflation than we originally expected, but our view here is that there's still a lot to happen in the second half. So for now, we're still targeting the $1.7 billion savings for this year. And as soon as we change our point of view on that, we will let you know.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then it sounded like in a bunch of the segments, pricing was lower in the quarter year-over-year because of some of the timing around promotional environment and things you talked about, trade spend timing. Should I read that that we'll start to see or a return I should say to positive year-over-year pricing as we move through the third quarter?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Andrew, this is George. Yes, you are right about that. So the Q2 pricing was down from a combination of things. One is higher promotional activities versus the prior year, particularly in April, where we are heavy on Easter promotions. And number two is the timing of the trade cost accrual last year, as Paulo mentioned. So we expect this to improve in the second half from a better balance between pricing and input cost. Also, please note that we have announced already price increases in a number of large categories already, so that's been done and been implemented in the marketplace.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good evening.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had two questions on the U.S.; they're related. You called out three different areas as problem areas, but when I look at the Nielsen data, we see volumes in snack nuts down 17%, shelf-stable juices down 9%, coffee down 9%, powdered beverages down 15%, but you also made this interesting comment about the Nielsen data just not being accurate. So two questions here. The first one is that, are these areas seeing significant weakness and maybe could you talk about them? And then secondly, just bigger picture on the Nielsen data, kind of what's wrong with this data? Is it something that you would dissuade people from relying on too much? Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you. I mean, this is \u2013 let me cut the question into two parts. It's a little bit complicated. First, we still have to rely on AC Nielsen. However, the coverage of AC Nielsen has shrunk to where we are selling our product. So with the changing retail landscape, measuring consumption is not as simple as it used to be. AC Nielsen cover mainly scanned or a non-census data within traditional and some \u2013 and clubs. However, there is significant growth going on in hard discounters and some big major club players that are not covered by Nielsen and almost the entire e-commerce channel is not covered by AC Nielsen, so just to give you an idea as I mentioned in my remark, rate from small base of 1%, our ecommerce channel is growing at 60%. It happened to be the two largest segments we have in ecommerce happen to be the snack nuts and coffee segments. So they lend themselves more towards that channel. The other thing is we are comfortable about where we are at with juices and our plans were delayed somewhat to take full advantage from the new products advertising and promotion as a combined bundle at the same time. So to summarize, yes, we still rely on AC Nelson, but we tried to focus the AC Nelson measurement in the channel, where we can scan data we add to it our own data to fill the gap to get the picture and that's why we have the diversions between what is net sales revenue and what is consumption from AC Nelson.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So today's data wouldn't suggest an inventory build at retail. It is saying that the Nelson data is just understating the reality of it because of these unmeasures, is that fair?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","It is fair for us. I can't speak for other companies and in our case, inventory build or decline was not a major factor in our Q2 results.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. So a two-part question. The first would be for your global route-to-market capability, and you're a little past the two-year mark in terms of the formal deal legally closing. So could you spend a moment talking about some of the global supply chain investments and CapEx and route-to-market spend, what evidence are you seeing of this yielding revenue synergies for some of your global brand platforms? And then secondarily, how do we think about adding new brands on top of your platform, what's particularly unique about what you've built here to drive incremental scale? Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Steven. It's Bernardo. You are right, we're just actually celebrating two years of the merger of The Kraft and Heinz this July, and it has been quite a journey and much more ahead of us. And to your question about investment in rest of the world, in our five-year strategic plan and the way we're positioned, remember, we talk about having trying to have three global brands with five platforms, and there would be significantly push towards these brands and platforms, and I'm pleased with the progress.","There is a lot of investment being made, especially in the rest of the world business on the supply chain side, not only on the manufacturing, but the capabilities. The approving process of the products, having them ready with local registration, packaging and go-to-market route, marketing, and you're seeing the results from that right. With the mac and cheese launch in Europe and Latin America, with the Planters being now \u2013 being rolled out from U.K. to Continental Europe to say Planters China, what has been 100% e-commerce driven as a launch. A lot of the \u2013 now we're preparing ourselves to the Kraft repatriation for 2018, that will affect our business in Continental Europe and Australia for next year.","So I would say it's too early to say, but we're pleased with the foundation of the things to accelerate. Part of the Rest of the World result, we're having is related to that. Our top line on the second quarter Rest of the World (39:55) of the question has been softer than our Q2 data for really two reasons that's nothing to do with your question on the global brands and the merger, but really the timing of Ramadan in Indonesia that have shift part of our sales to the first quarter and really the change in taxes system in India that has made our distributors destocking our products for some time that also is timing related. Taking out those two issues, we're very pleased with the progress on the Rest of the World and we should see that in the second half not only on the top line, but also in a better bottom line.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good afternoon.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good afternoon.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have a question for you, George, related to the food service business in the U.S., given where the consumer is sort of shifting more and more out of traditional food retail \u2013 food services is an important \u2013 should be an important component of your business to capture those sales, and so I guess, it's been an ongoing source of weakness here this year, so could you talk a little bit about maybe a little more color in terms of what's happening there and maybe some actions that you're taking to correct that?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. So you're right about foodservice, and we continue to think we have more whitespace to capture in this area and we are working hard not just in the U.S., but everywhere around the world. That being said, we did need to course correct, that in foodservice, we had a large number of initiatives that did not yield what we wanted to get out of it, so we found that we were chasing too many small things and we needed to reorganize, so that we were facing the customers, the large customers with large big ideas.","And we made that correction about two months, three months ago and we already started seeing some good results that we are pleased with. Last month was the first month where we start getting net \u2013 when we look at the net gain, net loss from customers, we got into the net gain positive territory. So overall, we expect foodservice business to continue improvement in the rest of the year and it continues to be a strategic whitespace for us.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Have you actually added sales people, like is there \u2013 do you just have more sales coverage than you had before?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","We refocused the sales team on where we believed the largest opportunities are. You see in the foodservice, it's a very large universe, you can get lost where you are chasing ideas, and we went through a program and a project to identify where best to focus our resources and our investments and we made that change a few months ago and we are very happy with what it is yielding, and going forward we expect more positive results.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operating: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good evening. Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Evening.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Just wanted to get some better understanding on Europe margins. A couple of years or so ago that looked like the sort of benchmark standard of where everything could go, and since then those margins have come back in, do you think they've peaked there, is there a path to how you see visibility on better upside and what's the right way to think about some of the leverage and opportunities you have there?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Michael, this is Paulo. So, yes, you're right, we \u2013 our European business used to have a much higher business, if you think like one, two years ago, pretty much three things I would mention here, that impacted this. The first one was for sure the depreciation of the pound. That had a big impact (44:34), because part of what we sell in U.K. comes from Continental Europe, so that was an impact that we have a transaction effects.","The second piece also is that we are growing more in the Continental Europe, so there is a geographical mix that changed. And the third also, we need to adjust slightly below lower margin because of \u2013 we add Russia on the Europe. So I think those three would be the main impacts in that order I told you in terms of that impacted the European margin. So I think going forward, I think we should see, as we always mention, our focus is in dollar margin to dollar growth, but as the business recover, I think we should see and should count on some margin accretion for the future.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","No. That's very helpful. Thank you. You also called out the higher promotional levels in the U.K. and Italy. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? How much is there ability to get some better pricing? And do you see sort of timing on when and how that might happen?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. Michael, I think there are two different stories here. On the Italy case, we're still going to go to a more extended promotion trends given what's happening in the baby food environment, remember, our sauces business expanding fast in the country. But baby foods continues to be predominantly the anchor of the business in the country and that has been a more challenged category with different competitors coming from different places outside Italy, or actually, the Italian brand and the Italian producer in the country.","The U.K. is going to depend a lot on where we're going over now to end the sauce season in the summer. Now it's going to come soup and back-to-school with beans that we're going to have some promotional activity, but we don't see that changing that much from the level we are right now. We are performing well in the country. We're back to growth and seeing volume\/mix and activity in the country, I would say, should be very stable even with the change (47:27) between sauces and soup and beans.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for the question.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","George, I'd like to ask about the mix opportunity in the U.S. I mean looking at some of your recent news, the organic Mac & Cheese is a premium product, the Simply Heinz Ketchup is at a premium price per ounce, and there's a few other examples I can think of. But when you look at your consumer base, what have you seen and how do you think about the opportunity to keep I guess just walking people up that pricing ladder through mix? Do you exhaust that at some point? Is it contingent on just continuing attractive new product? How do you think about that?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. It's a very good question about \u2013 particularly we always talk about the changing landscape in retail. There's always that changing landscape in consumers. And what we're finding there is a very large number of consumers in this market. They're happy to move up the value chain, and premiumization was one of our strategies to create growth. It's worked for us in beverages for Capri Sun organic. It's worked for us in ketchup with the Simply and organic. It's worked for us in Mac & Cheese by having priced at a 300% premium in Cracker Barrel versus the blue box Mac & Cheese, and you're going to continue to see some of that in the marketplace, so that's one way to create premium in a market where the population is stagnant, inflation is under wraps, and so forth.","The other area is to create new segments to deal with consumer needs, and we've got some exciting news that we'll be talking about that in the next few weeks where we will create new segments in the market that serves new consumer needs. The combination of these two supported with advertising and higher quality product, fresh and less processed, makes a good proposition for growth.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And I guess it may be just broad generalization, but are you finding that of the mix accretive products, those also tend to be margin accretive more often than not?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","It depends. So we find when we move to a more premium product, it can be margin accretive. In some area, we added costs in to protect the brands, and we could not price up in that category, so we have to do it in another category until consumers see value of it. So it depends on the category, it depends on the project. Either way, we are always driven by the consumer insights because that's what matters first to keep the brands relevant and keep the categories alive.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, George.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Good evening.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening, Chris.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Just a question for you, I think really for George in relation to the U.S. I think you mentioned in the quarter a flattish market share performance overall. So I guess I would confirm that. And I'm just curious if you see a stronger category performance picking up in the second half of the year, or is it more about your market share performance with all the activity you have coming up in the second half?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","It's a good question. So we have a large number of categories where we grew market share, including American Singles, including bacon, including ketchup, frozen meals, frozen snacks, and we have a number of categories where we lost market share, like natural cheese, cold cuts, and so forth. And that's why when you look at the balance, market share was not a major driver for a decline of the 1.2%. It was more the categories we're operating in.","Moving forward, with the different comps in the second half to what we had last year, that's number one. Number two, we implemented a number of price increases, which will lift the dollar value per pound in the category. And number three, we have a number of innovations either ramping up or about to announce to the market. That's why we are confident that the sequential improvement will continue in the second half from Q1 and Q2.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And can I ask in relation to that, there's been a number of companies, a number of categories, where you've seen private label make some inroads. Are you seeing that in any noticeable way in any of your categories in the U.S.?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, we are. There has been, as you said, a more pronounced focus in leading national retailers on increased private label total distribution point, merchandising, as a way to compete against discounters or separate themselves. For us the results of the focus on private label was mixed. We benefited a lot when retailers did that through an assortment work where they reduced the number of brands on offer, and it led to a better category performance. A great example of that, Kraft Singles and American Slices. By contrast, where retailers resorted to pricing private label so low to compete, it simply resulted in a reduction of the category size and profitability for everyone; example of that is natural cheese. So lucky for us, one offset the other. But just to give you an example how one was beneficial, the other one was not. So at the end of the day, what will win for us is growing our brands and categories by differentiating through innovation, through renovation, and strong communication campaigns.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you, George.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","George, I think I'll keep you talking for a bit longer and build off of I think your response to the last question in terms of private label, market dynamics, et cetera. We're hearing from a lot of your competitors about a lot more friction in terms of implementation of price increases than they've seen. Many have described it as sort of unprecedented. But you're on the call saying you're implementing, you're getting them through, it sounds like that the degree of friction isn't really what you're seeing. So can you expand on that a little bit more? From your vantage point with your categories, does the pricing environment really seem that different than it has in years past?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Well, implementing pricing anytime in any year is never a straightforward process. So, for us, we usually take the approach, whether there is an input cost, cost (54:48) product, or something like that. And we always do it when it's justified. We just don't take price increases if not justified. So that is, for us, utilizing our revenue management programs, combine that with our assortment management to create category value. That is usually what our selling story is based on.","And in most cases, you see when we implemented using assortment management, revenue management, build innovation around it, we created value for the entire category and not just for our brand. And in these instances, we have been successful doing it. But, again, it's never an easy task at any time in any year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you for that. And it was a nice segue into a related question. You mentioned revenue management. Some of us, myself included, have a lot of optimism of what it could do for our top line. Clearly categories are slower than they were when the optimism was percolating. But still even in accounting for the category slowdown, there isn't really a lot of tangible evidence success on that front, especially given that this is kind of the year that it was supposed to start to hit its stride. So can you bring us up-to-speed on where you stand on those initiatives? Why maybe we aren't seeing tangible evidence? And what we can expect on the forward?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. For us, we feel good about the implementation of our program. What's happening particularly in relation of where the promotional effectiveness and lift from promotional activity is heading, we feel very comfortable about the investments that we are making.","Revenue management is not about just taking a price increase or reducing trade. For us, sometimes we do exactly the opposite. We find it beneficial to do the opposite. So we're very comfortable where we are. We believe the effectiveness of our program is very good and we will continue with managing our categories through the tools we created in revenue management, through the tools we created in assortment management, and we will continue to innovate to grow the categories.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","If we could take one more question, that would be great.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much for getting me in. So two questions if you don't mind. One is quick. Is it fair to say that we see in the U.S. that revenue management is pretty much working outside of that like 20% of your business that's natural cheese and lunchmeats where it seems like you implemented some price increases and that resulted in some volume share loss? Would you agree? Is it fair to say that there's somewhat of a tale of two cities there and it's working outside of there? And secondly, a broader question, is there something perhaps fundamentally different about those particular categories as far as your level of value-add and does that shape the way you think about how you want to grow this portfolio going forward either internally or externally? Thank you.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Okay. So let me break down the question, the first one on revenue management, particularly in natural cheese and cold cuts. And the second one was about different things about shaping the business. Did I understand it correctly?","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Yes. Category attributes. It just seems like there is a big difference between category attributes.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Okay. So the natural cheese and cold cuts have different sets of issues. On the natural cheese, as I mentioned, there were really aggressive pricing that we did not take a major part in the marketplace, and that resulted in some share losses. And you can see the months when it happened and persisted with us over the last two, three months. So it was purely based on the elasticity through pricing, and we always keep assessing, moving forward, when we participate and when we do not participate.","On the cold cut cuts it's a completely different issue. The cold cuts, as we went through our footprint program, last year we had a major constraint. And we deleted a number of SKUs. So if you look at the total distribution points, or what we refer to as TDPs, is down year-on-year because of that and our merchandizing is down year-on-year before that.","Once we get over August, you'll find that this will change. We overlap that period of time and we feel good about rebuilding that business. As a matter of fact, the programs we put in the accounts where we accelerated the program, we started seeing a good trend then. Now is there anything different about these categories as opposed to other categories? What we see that we have higher chances of success where the brand equity is stronger and the relative market share is higher. So these two attributes allow us a little bit of flexibility in terms of both revenue management and assortment management. So building the brand equity is important to us. That's why we always focus on innovation and communication, and building our relative market shares because we believe these two attributes in any category are strong assets for the organization and the brands.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Very helpful.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our second quarter and first-half results as well as an update on our 2018 plan from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, Paulo Bas\u00edlio, President of our U.S. Zone, will join the rest of us for the Q&A session.","Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Similar to our Q1 results, our second quarter results were better than we expected at the time of our last earnings call. The transitory factors that lead us to be cautious on the near-term sales played out much as expected, including the headwinds in the United States from Planters and Ore-Ida and the impact from retail inventory change in Canada.","That said, we delivered slightly better net sales than expected. This was driven by encouraging, ongoing improvement in retail consumption trends in most countries and most categories as well as strong foodservice performance in a number of key countries. At EBITDA, we spoke about near-term pressures in the United States, Canada and Rest of the World from a combination of accelerated commercial investment, significant cost inflation, especially freight, as well as strong comparisons with the prior year in every region.","Still, we delivered stronger-than-expected EBITDA from solid productivity gains in EMEA as well as better growth in certain Rest of the World markets. In addition, and perhaps even more important, we continued to make progress in building the capabilities and putting in place the go-to-market plans that we expect will generate top line growth going forward.","Many of you have asked why we are so confident in our ability to deliver the top line and what specifically will drive it. So on the slide 3, we have laid out many of the key initiatives we expect will help us build momentum into the second half by region, by brand. In the United States, we saw consumption trends improve as Q2 unfolded, and as Planters' Club comparisons fade and as Ore-Ida and cold cuts activity and distribution improves, we're targeting top line growth in the third quarter. Our focus is on incremental volumes and mix improvements coming from new products like Lunchables, Around the World Flavorings, Oscar Mayer Plates, Just Crack an Egg, Heinz Real Mayonnaise as well as Planters where we brought back consumers' favorites, CHEEZ BALLS and CHEEZ CURLS for a limited time.","In addition, we are planning stronger in-store activity as we move forward, including back-to-school, behind main-stays like Oscar Mayer, Kraft cheese, Lunchables and Capri Sun, as well as continuing Philadelphia's growth with strong holiday programs. In Canada, while the impact of tariffs on sales is still largely unknown, we continue to feel good about getting Canada back to growth track by year-end. This should come on building on the good performance we are seeing in coffee products, frozen meals and Natural Cheese Slice innovation as well as stronger merchandising behind Cracker Barrel Cheese.","In EMEA, we are looking to sustain the momentum we have seen from the positive consumption tailwinds that have been driving performance to-date, including those coming from newly-repatriated Kraft and Bull's-Eye brands. In the second half, we also see opportunities for improvement for both whitespace and innovation initiatives, including Heinz in Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe, the recent launch of Bull's-Eye Barbecue in the UK and Plasmon Infant Biscuits in Italy.","And in our Rest of the World market, at some of \u2013 the short-term headwinds we recently experienced has started to fade. We expect some drivers to show towards a stronger way in the second half. These include: the strong growth and turnaround of Complan in India; the repatriation of the Kraft brands and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia\/New Zealand; Heinz condiments in Brazil and Mexico; Kraft Mayo in Brazil; and sauces whitespace expansion in Central America and the Southern Cone.","Outside of traditional retail, I also add that we have innovation distribution and assortment initiatives underway in Foodservice to drive substantial incremental gains in each region, as well as in the e-commerce channel where, in the United States alone, we're up more than 75% in both Q2 and through the first half. And our online portfolio is now over index market share, versus traditional retail channels.","In total, this is by far the strongest innovation pipeline we have had in place in our short history as Kraft Heinz. At the same time, and something we have been talking about are the commercial investments and capabilities to play more offense. It gives us further confidence in our ability to change trajectory in both distribution and consumption, especially behind innovation.","On slide 4, we show again the six goals from the framework we introduced early this year. During the second quarter and into the second half of 2018, we continue to make strides in each area. I just talked about our brand-building initiatives. Pushing into new categories, new segments, new occasions and doing this with a focus on incrementality, not just gross sales from new items. We will strongly support this, for instance, through data-driven marketing, where we are putting our in-house tools to work to drill deeper into the quality impressions. We are concentrating on building even more native impressions or impressions that are created by being part of the conversations of consumers' everyday lives and earned impressions, where you can create the news and share it through media coverage.","For those of you in the United States, you have seen this at work with our Heinz Mayochup and Country Time by Legal-Ade campaigns, helping to drive improving consumption trends. Year-to-date, we estimate that native and earnings PR impressions we have generated in the United States alone is greater than all of 2017 and double what we generated in full-year 2016. And we have more coming to support our second-half initiatives. In both category management and go-to-market capabilities, we now have more capacity to drive category and brand growth, as our product pipeline will be fully in place in Q3.","In category management, while we have significant potential still ahead, there are key areas of improvement we can leverage right now. At retail in the United States, for instance, our efforts have been targeted at improving SKU adoption, distribution velocities through assortment management and planograms. And in Canada, our in-house tools and disciplined rituals and routines are in place to help set pricing guidelines and guardrails as well as conduct pre-and post-event analysis, all aimed to make more informal decisions and improve returns.","In go-to-market capabilities, the next wave of our in-house in-store sales teams is now in place in the United States, on track to more than double by the end of the year. With that, we believe that we now have critical mass to see a measurable impact on feature and display conversion, out-of-stocks and planogram compliance, just as we ramp up our second half sales plan.","When our capability and product news (10:31) come together, we see measurable, incremental and sustainable gains. We see Oscar Mayer Hot Dogs increase households' penetration and velocity, grow dollar sales and gain share. This is happening now behind our For the Love of Hot Dogs campaign and a step-up in store activity at Memorial Day and Fourth of July.","We see successful breakthrough innovation like our Just Crack an Egg platform. Just over six months in the market launch velocities roughly two times our estimates, top quartile trial and repeat, improving to be a successful bridge between convenient and freshness.","And internationally, when our marketing, category management and go-to-market capability come together, we hit the ground running with newly repatriated and acquired brands like Bull's-Eye and Kraft in Europe and Cerebos in Australia and New Zealand, both are performing ahead of plan.","Finally, the backbone of everything we do, operations, people and corporate social responsibility are fully aligned and even more capable to execute our plans. In operations, we continue to deliver against aggressive industry-leading targets in quality, safety and customer service in nearly all geographies we operate. Customer service in particular had been an area of significant focus and investment and we have made significant improvements in the United States and Canada.","And in people, during Q2, we leveraged our Marketing Playbook and Category Marketing programs to close any gaps in best-in-class skills and capabilities and further deploy our new in-house tools. And on the CSR front, early this week, we expanded our environmental commitments. We aim to deliver a 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025. And we are doing our part to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by joining the Science Based Targets Initiative and working to set science-based carbon reduction goals.","So to summarize, our first half results came in better than expected. Our second half commercial plans are the most robust since the 2015 merger and now it's up to us to execute with excellency.","I will now hand it over to David to provide more color on our Q2 results and how our plans for the second half are likely to play out in our financial results going forward.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone. Turning to our results on slide 5, total company organic net sales were down 40 basis points in Q2, sequentially better than Q1 and, as Bernardo said, somewhat better than what we expected at the time of our last call. Pricing was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 1.3 percentage points in Q2 and 1.1 percentage points in the first half.","In both periods, this was driven by a combination of pricing to offset local input costs in Rest of World markets and carryover pricing in both the U.S. and Canada that more than offset stepped up in-store and new product activity in EMEA. Volume mix was 1.7 percentage points lower in Q2 and two points lower for the first half due to known headwinds in the United States and Canada that overshadowed strong growth in EMEA.","By segment, the U.S. was slightly better than our initial expectations. As expected, Planters and Ore-Ida had a negative impact of approximately 1.5%, and the combination of trade spend timing and Easter shift was roughly one point of headwind to Q2 net sales. Excluding these factors, underlying U.S. consumption again exceeded reported results and showed a slight sequential improvement from Q1. And I would add that consumption has continued to improve based on the data we've seen so far for July.","In Canada, results reflected the anticipated combination of comparisons with prior year promotional activity that was not repeated primarily in condiments and sauces, as well as trade inventory adjustments and select product discontinuations. EMEA had another strong quarter driven by strong condiments and sauces' growth across the zone, including solid consumption gains for both the Kraft and Bull's-Eye brands. Strong gains in Foodservice in every region are also contributing to EMEA growth.","And in Rest of World, while top line growth was supported by pricing, another quarter of strong vol mix gains in condiments and sauces across the majority of regions and strong growth of Complan in India were again held back by one-off factors. In Q2, this included lower sales of canned seafood in Indonesia and the truckers strike in Brazil. That said, we do expect sequential improvement in Rest of World moving forward.","At EBITDA, Q2 performance was slightly better than expected, although the drivers were consistent with our expectations. Specifically, we had solid gains from productivity savings and net pricing; gains that were offset by inflationary pressures, primarily elevated freight and resin costs; as well as costs associated with our aggressive commercial investment agenda. And in adjusted EPS, we were up $0.02 versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by a roughly 720-basis-point reduction in the tax rate on adjusted earnings.","Overall, our first half financial performance was consistent with the type of start to the year we expected, if not somewhat better than expected at the profit line, and provides a solid base from which to build, which brings us to our outlook on slide 6. As Bernardo outlined, we believe things are in place for us to push a more aggressive growth agenda in the second half from a strong innovation pipeline, distribution gains across channels, as well as expanding our brands into geographic whitespace.","Despite the slow start with several transitory headwinds and recent key commodity weakness in the U.S., we believe we're in a strong position to deliver organic growth for the full year, and therefore, we continue to expect that 2018 will be a year where the first half second half balance of net sales will be skewed to the second half. Our organic net sales growth is expected to begin now in Q3 with the U.S. growing and EMEA and Rest of World sustaining momentum. In Canada, with near-term risks at play, it may be Q4 until we see the turn.","To support this growth and given our confidence in the pipeline of activities that Bernardo described, we're planning our commercial investments to be at the high-end of the $250 million to $300 million range we previously discussed, mainly in the form of more working media dollars. At the same time, we think it's appropriate to be more conservative in the near-term with expectations around adjusted EBITDA. And instead of the second half skew that we previously talked about, we now expect more of a 50-50 split to the year. This is driven by three factors.","One is that we will be at the high-end of our planned commercial investments that I just mentioned. Two is our stronger-than-expected first half delivery. And three is cost inflation, where a number of areas have stayed higher for longer than we anticipated, mainly in freight and transportation; packaging, both resins and cardboard; as well as tariff risk currently impacting foil and aluminum costs in the U.S. and certain products we sell in Canada.","Net-net, our savings curve will take more time to overcome the incremental cost inflation we expect during the remainder of 2018. So, as we assess Q3 prospects, the combination of greater-than-expected inflation, a more aggressive investment posture and difficult comparisons on variable compensation versus last year will mean that Q3 adjusted EBITDA dollars are likely to be down a greater order of magnitude than what we saw in the first half of the year. That said, we do expect our constant currency adjusted EBITDA trend to improve by year-end and gain further momentum into 2019 with productivity net of cost inflation accelerating, while the recovery in top line momentum continues.","Below the line, we are still targeting adjusted EPS growth and strong cash generation in 2018. This should be aided by tax favorability where we now can expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for the full year in 2018. I will also note that based on successful recent refinancing activity, we now expect incremental interest expense in 2018 of roughly $80 million versus the $100 million we previously outlined. And in terms of cash generation, we continue to expect a significant step-up in 2018, despite a near-term headwind to working capital from recent termination of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring program in the U.S.","To close, I think it's worth repeating the thoughts that we've expressed all year: that we're developing capabilities to create brand and category advantage to achieve profitable growth; that we're investing aggressively now in order to see benefits sooner; and that these factors will shape our near-term results in 2018, and will drive sustainable profitable growth into 2019 and beyond.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.

Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess I'll kick it off with, with all of the investments in capabilities that you've been making recently, and clearly some of the renewed confidence in the organic top line growth starting as of Q3, I guess, do you feel as though this makes Kraft Heinz more willing to perhaps consider assets that may require a bit more heavy lifting rather than ones that already have better growth prospects, but would certainly come at higher multiples?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. This is Bernardo. Good morning.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Well, let me start with the investment part of your question. We're happy that we accelerated the investments we announced at the beginning of the year, creating the capabilities that I really believe are going to stay here. You're going to start seeing the second half of this year, but are going to stay with us in 2019 and beyond, right, behind go-to-market sales teams, channels, activations, innovation, marketing dollars and so on. We always said that was one investment that we would see results in the year to come. So, we're happy with the program. And as we always said as well, we wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice a point of margin to generate accelerated growth on the top line.","With that in mind, your question is given the capability we're building, now how this plays on M&A or more organic plans for the company, right? What I can say about that is pretty much what we have been saying and have been consistent for quite some time. Our framework has really not changed, right. The fact that we like big brands, the fact that we like business that can travel and international, the fact that we do like to take synergies from existing business and to reinvest behind brands, behind products and behind people. I don't think that this framework change because of the capabilities we're developing.","Why I can say that with the experience we have today after being \u2013 since Heinz 2013 \u2013 five years into the industry, the knowledge on the category, the knowledge of the things that do work and things that you have seen that do not work, and so on, allows us to be much more confident where to put the money, what assets can be turned around, and things that can really be within this framework. And also true to the fact that our ability to integrate and to connect companies for a bigger scale and so on, given that you have been doing that for quite some time. And every time we have been doing better, got faster and we have a better understanding.","To your question about assets, slower growth, or higher growth, and so on, I don't think that changed with what we have in mind from a framework standpoint.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can I ask about the pricing environments in North America? It seems as though it's been pretty challenging for the last 18 months or so. You've obviously got some positive pricing that's running through now. How do you expect that to play out in the second half? And just how do you see the environment and the retailers' relationships playing out from here on out?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Alexia. This is Paulo. So again, we believe that we have strong brands. We have differentiated products. We have a strong innovation pipeline and so far we've been able to drive our brands and products in line with what we perceive to be the value to the consumer, so. But we always keep in mind it's very important to us to strike the right balance between market share, distribution and profitable volume. So this balance will play very differently in each category that we play. So today, I can say that the relationship we have with customers are going very well and a very clear connection with all of them.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And so, do you expect the pricing to strengthen as we get into the back half? Or the price mix to improve?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Alexia, as a matter of practice, we don't forecast pricing for the future. But what we can say there, the growth that we expect to have in the second half is going to be more balanced to volume mix.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just two questions related to the investment in capabilities, the P&L investment this year. I think if I remember it correctly, you're spending about $300 million, P&L dollars against it. And I guess, two things. One, is this sort of an ongoing expense, meaning will it be an incremental headwind again as we kind of move into the future? Or is it sort of a one-year step-up? And then second, if you could talk a little bit about how those investments specifically would help you. Or do they at all improve your ability to integrate acquisitions? So like the difference between integrating without these capabilities versus what it was before.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, Bryan. It's Bernardo. The investments were announced. What really scaled up was a one-off, the $300 million that you want to accelerate the capability to have in the company in go-to-market, channel activation, in innovation launch platforms, and service levels with specific investments directed to specific customers especially in the United States. So that, I would say, is coming really well, creating the capability the company has for the future, not only we expect to see that already has some results in the second half of the year, but 2019 and beyond. That is, like we said before, a step-up as a one-off. Okay?","Related to the second part of your question about the capabilities of integrating faster in an M&A environment, how this would happen, those capabilities will help us. I think, like I said, at the first question, the learning and the experience we have today allowed us to have very knowledge on each one of the categories and those capabilities are created when you think about revenue management, assortment management, planogram, go-to-market, breakthrough innovation, channel mix, activation in e-commerce, Foodservice, clubs, drugstores, all these kinds of capabilities, they are scalable in an organic environment.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I could just follow up, David, is it still $300 million that you're spending back this year?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan. This is David. That's correct. We talked about at the beginning of the year, commercial investments and investments in service between $250 million to $300 million, so now we expect to be on the high end of that at closer to $300 million.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. So if we're thinking about the EBITDA guide for the year even though you're having to have faced some inflation, you chose to actually spend at a high-end of the investment either way. Because of it, it's going to make sense longer-term?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, that's correct.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions, I guess, the first question just in cadence for the rest of the year, Q3 versus Q4. In terms of what you said about Q3 that Q3 EBITDA would be down slightly more than it was down in the first half of the year, and then we should see a pick back up in Q4, just relative to internal forecast originally from the beginning of the year, is there a change to the full year just to be clear? Or is it \u2013 so some came in a little bit better in the first half and really in Q2, but then it will be a little bit worse in Q3? Or how should we think about kind of where you are right now and how you view the full year versus where you viewed the full year at the end of 2017? That's it.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure. Hi, Rob. This is David. Thanks for the question. So in terms of the second half cadence, so I'll start with Q3. So, our profitability in the quarter in Q3 versus last year is going to be driven by three factors. So first, we expect that the swing from overhead favorability we mentioned last year to a more normal incentive compensation accrual this year to be roughly $75 million to $100 million in the quarter.","Second, as noted, we plan to be at the high-end of our commercial investments for the year. So again, the high end of the range of the $250 million to $300 million I mentioned and this is to support our second half growth initiatives more strongly.","And third is the fact that the additional inflation we noted is running ahead of our savings curve in the short-term. So those are really the three factors in Q3 that are going to drive that trend.","Going forward in Q4 we expect our comparisons to ease and our savings curve to accelerate, although we think it's best to maintain a conservative set of expectations with regard to cost inflation. So that's why we think the year is going to look a little bit more balanced versus what we talked about earlier in the year.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just quickly on tariffs, I think I heard you call out a few inflationary aspects of tariff effects on specific commodities. Is there some potential risk though in terms of volumes do you foresee? And just very general, it's just a very general question.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. So in terms of tariffs, I think the point that I want to get across is given what we're seeing we want to be conservative and that drives our kind of outlook for the year. But these types of things, we're not exactly sure what will stick and for how long. So we're not going to take a stance yet on potential actions that we can take to offset those things, so I'm not going to talk about that now but I think given those factors and some of the cost inflation we're seeing in the market, again, we're going to have this kind of more conservative stance on the year.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Super. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just had two quick questions for you. I wanted to ask first of all, if you look at this quarter, if you think of like the old PNOC, pricing net of commodity inflation, is that positive or negative in the quarter here such that are you getting pricing through given this accelerated rate of non-commodity inflation? That's my first question.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure. Hi, Chris. This is David. So I won't talk specifically on the quarter but I'd say overall for the year we continue to expect pricing relative to our key commodities to be stable. We have recently seen some key commodities come down more recently and expect that for the year. But as a matter of practice, we're not going to discuss potential future pricing actions relative to that. But as Paulo said earlier, we're confident in the strength of our brands and will continue to strike a balance between market share distribution and profitable volume as it relates to commodities.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And so just to be clear, does non-key commodity inflation come into your thinking as you're approaching pricing? Not that you're going to tell me what you're going to do, but is that a factor you'd consider in terms of your pricing? Or (35:30) offset with cost savings?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes. So it's certainly part of the equation there. We're not going to provide color on pricing going forward. But between commodities, non-key commodity inflation, we think in terms of pricing and potential productivity initiatives to offset that.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I had just one question as well. You've had some weight on your sales from Planters and Oscar Mayer and Ore-Ida. I think you approached much easier comparisons on that front in the second half of the year. Is that right? You get past a lot of those issues in the second half? And do those shift to growth in the second half of the year as a result of that?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Chris. This is Paulo. I think that is one of the components, as we said. We are confident that we're expecting sales to grow in U.S. in the second half. I think one component that we are seeing is that you can see that our categories are improving, our categories now are growing. And on top of that, the big headwinds in share that you were seeing, these negative headwinds, we expect them to fade. I can give examples of cold cuts, Ore-Ida, lost distribution that we have, the capacity restrictions we had. Now we have the capacity in place, so we expect to recover the distribution.","I can also say that on top of that, we're going to see our \u2013 we have a strong innovation pipeline coming to the market that's already distributed \u2013 and also a much better and stronger program driving improvement in consumption. So pretty much this is the main pillars to support our expectations for growth in the second half.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good Morning.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Two quick ones. You mentioned food service a couple times and I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on some of your initiatives there and what the opportunities are? And how much is it white space driven that you're filling in gaps? And then just second, following up on Andrew's question a little bit, how do you handicap the ability of a brand to travel? And how do you think about that when you are evaluating inorganic growth?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Michael. It's Bernardo. With respect to food service, it has been actually a white space opportunity worldwide, not only here in the United States, that you have been growing now for the second year in a row. But worldwide has been double-digits growth, in Europe. We have seen many countries in Asia that have been experiencing growth in food service. Remember, we're building a factory in countryside at Brazil in the state of Goi\u00e1s that there is a significant volume related to food service. So it has been a strategic decision from the company to create capabilities in different zones and countries to push this.","We do believe our products resonate in a big way. There are some adaptations, and I think we're getting better as a company to create the right packaging and the right product assortment to understand the dynamics of this channel that are different than normal retail channel. So that has been something that has been improving in the company. We do expect that to continue in the years to come. And do expect us to get better and to be stronger in the food service channel than we've ever been, again, not only in the United States that has been more a reality for some time but other parts of the world.","The second part of your question about the capabilities and how to evaluate from an M&A standpoint, remember, we are seeing that and we are doing that, taking brands from existing countries and making them on a global or a zoned stage now for some time, right? We had the repatriation of Kraft this year in Europe and Australia. I think a good example that is unfolding as we speak is the launch of BULL'S-EYE barbecue and premium sauces in UK and Continental Europe. And we're seeing Kraft being deployed now in Latin America; being launched in Brazil. It's being launched in many countries in Asia. We are seeing Planters being deployed in UK, Continental Europe, China and other countries. So we have been doing that.","I don't think \u2013 and understanding the category and having a stronger brand that resonates sometimes in a country like America. In the case of BULL'S-EYE, it was very strong in Germany, and now we are making in different countries in Europe, but understanding the strength of the brand, what is the category drivers and what consumers want, I think the connection is quite there. As we evaluate new brands on the organic, for sure always there are risks. But I would say our experience today allows us to be more assertive about it.","Michael S. Lavery - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for the question.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good morning.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A quick question for clarification. Did I hear you right that you're now expecting EBITDA to be about a 50-50 split, front-half, back-half?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Jason. This is David. That's right. We expect it to be a little bit more balanced, 50-50 for the year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That implies that EBITDA, if we just kind of track with the first half, would be down year-on-year by a bit over $200 million. Last quarter, you guys guided for organic EBITDA growth, and you mentioned that first half is exceeding expectations. I'm kind of interpreting this to mean that you're lowering your full year EBITDA guidance by about $300 million. Is that wrong?","And given that you've over delivered, it's really all coming in the back half. I know you've got some cost creep with some items, but you also mentioned some of your key commodities trending down. What am I missing to bridge that all the way to that $300-ish sort of million dollar difference?","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Sure, Jason. This is David. So let me walk you through kind of the cadence of what we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we continue to have good visibility on significant productivity and cost savings initiatives for the remainder of the year and going into 2019 as well.","That said, as I talked about, we're seeing additional cost inflation that in the immediate term is outpacing the savings curve, and it's just kind of two factors. So first, we have some costs that are staying higher for longer, and in some cases like freight, they're continuing to climb this year. And then second, as I talked about, we had some headwinds from tariffs as well, of which we're not exactly sure what will stick or for how long. But for those reasons, we think it's better to take a more conservative stance.","At the same time, we have an opportunity to drive sustainable consumption gains from investments that Bernardo mentioned in our commercial pipeline. So again, we think it's best to kind of head into the second half with a more conservative set of expectations around near-term EBITDA dollars, especially for Q3, as I mentioned, and continue to focus on the sustainable top- and bottom-line growth going forward.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys, for the (44:23) questions. So I wanted to go back to the M&A. A question I get a lot is why hasn't something happened? Obviously, we know that you guys have been out there trying to, you know, looking at different assets. I guess I wanted to take a step back and understand what you're saying, your take on the landscape both M&A clearly does matter a lot, especially with Walmart in the North American market, Walmart taking as much volume share as they are, it'd be nice to have the CPG companies consolidate a little bit more aggressively especially you guys and I'm wondering if you think there's some structural impediments to that?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi. Here's Bernardo. If I understood correct the question about there is something structure that would be in the middle of more consolidation and M&A in the industry, right? And then you relate to the Walmart example. We really don't see that way. I think the food industry is an industry that has not consolidated with the same speed as other industry. There are some reasons for that given local pace and regulations and other things, but not to the extent we have seen it. So we do believe looking mid or long-term that there will be more consolidation in the industry and we have not shying to say that we want to be a force behind this when the process happens, right?","To your point about structural obstacles and so on, we don't see really any in that sense. I think again it's important in our case to be very disciplined on our approach and our framework like that has not changed. We are disciplined on price to the value creation equation. I think we have proved that over time and that's something we believe is important for the long-term value creation equation, okay? And I think also important to say, we don't do something to be happy for a quarter and then be regretting for the long-term to be apologizing for the next couple of years. When it move, we definitely move with a much longer-term view believing that something is going to make the company stronger for the years to come.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, I appreciate the answer. My follow-up question is, it just seems that and what the answers have been around pricing in kind of the back half of the year, I mean, my interpretation it's just hard to get price through. I mean, you talk about cost inflation and not being able to be offset by the underlying savings, but that's my interpretation of what you guys have been saying. Is that interpretation incorrect? And I'll yield. Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi. This is Paulo. No. I think that is a balance. It's always a balance as we've been discussing. Again, we've been able to price our brands so far but the way that we approach this is not to price to offset a specific cost. It's really to find and to strike the right balance between a profitable volume, distribution, and share. So that's our approach. At the end of the day, profitability is one of the components. It's not the only one. We see the bid is more \u2013 as what's the position that we're going to take that's going to be healthier for the business looking to this three components that we shared. But so far as we said, we've been able to price our booked volume (48:45) in line with the value that we have, that our products have for the consumer, so.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Welcome.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC. Your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone. You've listed a lot of reasons why sales were constrained in the first half in emerging markets, U.S., Canada, and separately you highlighted the analytics and sales investments. And to those two buckets I would add that in some key commodity categories like cheese, you've had some big volume declines. So I guess what I'm wondering is, going into the second half of the year, could you give some color about the reasons and timing for the sales recovery? Where will you see the sales improve earlier and where later? Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi. This is Paulo. I'm going to speak for the last year. Pretty much the components are the ones we were sharing. So first of all, we are seeing our categories improving, so our categories are running positive today. Many negative shares that we saw in the first half of the year are fading. We have in the innovation pipeline coming and again when you see what is giving us confidence on that in the U.S. is that when you see the consumption of figures that we have for July, these already happened. We are already trading positive consumption in the month in July. So it's pretty much just the combination of improvement in the categories, the negative headwinds that we have fading, investment in innovation and better programming that is giving us this confidence by the second half.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","And, David, from a worldwide standpoint, we have Europe, Middle East and Africa continuing to grow with the same momentum they have in the first half of the year. We do see acceleration in Latin America especially after the strike event in Brazil in May, in June, July and moving forward we do see acceleration in some countries in Asia where you have the one-offs with the problems with fish supply in Indonesia and some inventory timing in China behind us. And we do you see a barrier sequentially performance in Canada, right, given the level of activation and innovation coming to market in the second half of the year in the country. With this picture, together what Paulo just mentioned in the United States, we feel confident about the acceleration and the connection between the investment we announced in the beginning of the year and the results you're going to see in the top-line in the second half of the year, Q3, Q4 going into first half 2019.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Great. If we could take maybe one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you very much for the question. I guess a little bit of a follow-up, Bernardo, you talked about to Jason English's question, when you think about \u2013 you talked about capabilities investments, and for a company that's been very, very return-focused and very successful doing so, I'm just wondering how much of these capabilities investments have a return that we can measure in 2019, 2020? And if you could, I know you don't guide for 2019 or necessarily a long-term basis, but these investments you're talking about, are these really just increases in the cost of competition versus what you might have thought on January 1? Or would you really see that maybe versus where we were thinking January 1 it's just a question of maybe profits being pushed forward into 2019 and subsequent years from these investments relative to your expectations? Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi Jon. The way we see that and if you think about what we did, was not really a change on the plans we had. We knew the capabilities were there and we knew what to do. We took advantage of a better scenario we had in the United States from a free cash flow standpoint and we did accelerate the plans we had from a commercial standpoint to drive those capabilities, right? So it's not something that was new to us but the acceleration given the numbers we have been seeing in the pilots we run in 2016, 2017, allowed us to be confident about where we are deploying the capital, right?","And the reason you're going to see that is because a lot of the innovation that's coming to market, Just Crack an Egg, we started in 2016, right? Planters Crunchers, Heinz Real Mayo, Capri Sun natural, Capri Sun zero sugar, pasta sauce, Heinz in Continental Europe, BULL'S-EYE in Continental Europe, Heinz and Kraft Mayo in Southern Cone and Brazil in Latin America, right? The expansion of two biscuit category and nuts category in China, right. All those things we're having time and have been developed but with the acceleration of those capabilities, understanding the category, connecting to our field teams in some countries that we wanted to expand, getting our channels right and so on, would allow us to be in a position not only in the second half but looking at 2019 and 2020 in a better way. That's what I'm saying, that's a one-off to enhance our capabilities and then we come back to a normal plan.","So looking 2019 and 2020 you're probably going to go back to match our returns in a normal year plan, what's the return given my results on net sales, my results on profitability, and so on. We continue to be very focused in value creation, right? That's us. We're a performance-driven company and we are very pleased with the culture and with the way it is progressing the morale, the way we're seeing the second half of the year, the way our employees that's really the competitive advantage of the company is really engaging with the plans we have for the short-term in the second half 2018 but looking into 2019 and beyond. So we do believe there is a return for that and that's why we're confident in the investment we're making.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Understood.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, we reorganized our operating segments to better align with our global growth strategy, and therefore have reflected these changes in our business segment reporting for all periods presented. As a result, our Russian business is now part of our Europe segment instead of rest of world, and cost associated with our Global Procurement Office have been reclassified from our Europe segment to general corporate expenses.","Now, let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and Happy New Year to everyone. As I hope you saw in our press release, we had solid Q4 results overall with solid sales and business investments to further improve the health of our brand. But I'll start by focusing more on what we have been able to accomplish in the first full year of The Kraft Heinz Company. It formed the base and in many ways that's our agenda for the year ahead.","So, let's start with our progress against the three objectives of our strategy that we laid out at the beginning of our merger. In our first objective, to deliver profitable sales growth, on the top line, we built positive momentum through the year, despite the commodity headwinds that persisted during the year, resulting in profitable sales and flat to positive organic sales growth in all regions except Europe. We generated significant gains from our Big Bet innovation strategy in our efforts to capture whitespace opportunities. This was led by condiments worldwide, especially ketchup and barbecue sauce, pasta sauce in North America and Latin America; soy sauce in China, and hot sauces and mayo in Europe.","Our investments also led to better market share trends over the course of the year in core categories such as sauces worldwide including pasta sauce in Canada and Latin America; green cheese and mac & cheese in the United States, UK beans; baby food in Italy; and in Australia, beverage. That said we still have significant areas to improve in 2017. They include Indonesia soy sauces, U.S. cold cuts, baby food in Canada, and our non-measured channel shares in the UK to just name a few.","We also pushed into places, whitespace, where Kraft Heinz did not previously compete, products such as Devour frozen meal, Cracker Barrel mac & cheese and Heinz Barbecue Sauces in the United States. There was Planters which now is available in both China and the UK. We also brought Heinz Mayonnaise to Europe, Brazil and Australia. And we made significant progress toward extending our foodservice presence, not just in the west but through strong performance in Canada, Brazil and Russia as well.","Nevertheless, there is much, much more to go after in 2017 and beyond. It's also clear that our go-to-market investments are paying off and delivering profitable growth through distribution gains and better performance at retail. We supported go-to-market activations with better management of our field teams in Canada, U.S., Brazil, Russia and China. These efforts resulted in phased execution improvement in a challenging retail environment all around the world, including Australia, Japan, China, Russia, Egypt, Brazil and Germany.","And then our second objective, we made meaningful progress toward achieving best-in-class margins. Through our ritual and routines, including zero-base budgeting and managed by objectives, we drove sustainable improvements throughout the year. ZBB savings were a key driver of value creation across the company delivering faster than expected savings at the outset of the year and contributing to the company achieving $1.2 billion in cumulative savings since the inception of our Integration Program. As of today, we have cascaded personal MBOs directly from company leadership to more than 6,000 employees worldwide. This is a critical step in aligning everyone behind common goals and improving our day-to-day execution. To put that number in context, this represents more than 50% of our white collar population around the world.","And in supply chain, we invested more than $1 billon into manufacturing upgrades in our footprint program to modernize our facilities and enhance our capacity for innovation and quality. We went live with our Global Business Services in Europe, which together with our shared service integration in North America, helped drive processes standardization and improved service levels. Importantly, as all of these was happening, we achieved a global case fill rate of 98%. We also invested heavily in our people, in our capability. For example, we promoted more than 1,700 team members worldwide last year. We expanded our talent acquisition programs worldwide, growing the volume of applicants by 40%. And in our ongoing effort to grow a better world into a partnership with Rise Against Hunger, we package and distribute more than 65 million meals to people in need.","Finally, on the capital structure front, our leverage ratio was reduced to approximately 3.6 times EBITDA and we kept up our strong dividend payout. Paulo will build more on our capital structures improvement in a moment. Overall, we made solid progress in our first full year as a merger company and it set a strong base for us to build upon in the next phase of our development.","So let's turn to slide three to review our Q4 and full year financial results and how the numbers bear out our progress. As it relates to the company sales, there're really two things to highlight. First, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, we drove sequentially better organic sales growth driven by volume\/mix improvement in all segments. The primary contribution to this growth were condiments and sauce globally and costs in refrigerated meal combinations in the United States. Second, we had solid price realization in most segments during the year despite a deflation in key commodities like dairy, coffee and meat in the U.S. as well as the trade investments we made in our UK and Netherlands business.","Net EBITDA full year growth at constant currency was driven by strong cost savings from integration and restructuring activities, favorable net price and growth in our Rest of the World market. I should note however that our rate of growth in Q4 was held back by two factors. First, we began to lap integration savings that began last year in Q4. And, second, we accelerate our investment behind growth initiatives late in the year, as well as trade investment we made in our UK and Benelux business. Dropping down to our adjusted EPS, both Q4 and full year were up more than 50% excluding the extra week last year, primarily driven by EBITDA gains and the refinancing of the preferred stock in June.","Now, I will hand over to George and Paulo to highlight our performance in each reporting segment and what we expect going forward. George?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide four and our performance in the United States. The first point I would make is that we had a strong finish to 2016, in many ways giving us good momentum from a consumer takeaway perspective as we head into 2017.","If you look at the charts on the right, there are few things I would note. First, in measured channel, the negative impact from commodity deflation on category growth persisted during 2016 and longer than we originally thought, although, we currently expect that this is likely to turn to inflation as 2017 progresses. Second and more importantly, you can see that we had improved measured channel share performance in Q4 versus our 52-week numbers below, driven by our Big Bets and better retail execution.","Specifically, we drove strong consumption improvement from the launch of Devour and SMARTMADE in frozen meal, mainstream, and ground coffee and pods as well as nice turnaround in sandwich cheese, both Kraft Singles and Natural. This was supported by improved execution at retail with an increase in total distribution points, TDPs, versus the prior year in Q4 and better feature and display conversion. In fact, we exited the year with a shorter list of share challenges than we started the year with. We also saw a longer list of categories moving into share gains and ended the year with roughly 70% of our categories holding or gaining shares in Q4.","The third factor I would highlight is that sales in Q4 were good. However, they included some one-off benefit that will not repeat. Foodservice was not a contributor to non-measured channel growth in Q4 as whitespace gains gave way to weakening trend in base consumption and store traffic. And although, we had further whitespace gains in non-measured retail channel, much of the green bar in the top right of the graph was due to the benefit of trade inventory shifts versus the prior year.","Specifically, we had a relatively weak Q4 2015 comparison that reflected retail inventory de-loading as well as strong shipments in Q4 2016 to support a very robust level of in-store activity during the holidays. In the end, we exited the year with some of our Q4 shipments needing to be worked off in January. And we expect Q1 2017 shipments will see roughly a half-a-point headwind versus consumption, because of this. And that's before the impact of the Easter shift that Paulo will talk about later.","So overall, we closed 2016 with significant progress in the marketplace and improved execution, during the year of significant transformation, just as we planned. Looking forward, our agenda for 2017 is focused on three simple goals. One, on the top-line, drive profitable growth and further improve challenged categories. Two, better leverage our scale, at retail, with increased in-store activity, including more scale events and improve our day to day sales execution. And three, utilize our supply chain modernization or footprint initiative, as a way to increase investments in innovation and renovation, particularly, at the back half of the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. I will start on slide 5, to highlight the two more things on U.S. financials. First, price was higher for the year and in Q4, despite persistent headwinds from deflation in key commodities. Although, it appears, we've now reached the bottom on commodities and are likely to have to contend with commodity inflation beginning in Q1 of this year. Second, we were encouraged by the improvement, in our vol\/mix performance over the course of the year. We had better results in meats, ready-to-drink beverage late in the year. And this combined with the strong growth in coffee, Lunchables and mac & cheese that we saw all year and drove positive growth.","Moving to EBITDA, the U.S. delivered strong double-digit growth all year driven by cost saving initiatives and favorable net pricing. In Q4, although the pace of cost savings was in line with our expectations, EBITDA growth was held back by timing of overhead expenses versus the prior year.","Let's turn to slide 6 and Canada where our results played out fairly consistent with what we had talked about on our Q3 call. Pricing trailed input cost fluctuations in local currency throughout the year. By that I mean that, from a P&L perspective, pricing was lower to follow deflation in key commodities in the first part of the year and late in following higher input costs in local currency, particularly in the fourth quarter. By contract, volume\/mix performance showed more of a steady improvement, first half to second half. This primarily reflected solid gains in condiments, sauces and foodservice, which were partially offset by the volume impact of lower cheese shipments versus the prior year. At EBITDA, I think it's important to highlight that despite the ups and downs during the year, Canada's full-year adjusted EBITDA and margin are fairly representative of the current health and profitability of the business.","That brings us to Europe on slide 7. We said on our last call that the health of our European business was better than our Q3 numbers indicated, and with or without Russia in these numbers that bore out in Q4. As a general rule of thumb, from a 2016 versus 2015 perspective, the addition of Russia to our Europe segment has the effect of adding roughly 1.5 points of organic net sales growth and roughly 75 basis points to constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, but reduces segment EBITDA margin by approximately 130 basis points. That being said, our performance this year in Europe is not what we planned, and not what we would expect in any year. It's true that we had strong unfavorable currency translation all year, and that's likely to continue into the beginning of 2017.","But from an operating perspective, we made significant trade investments during the year, primarily to jumpstart our UK business in a changing and difficult retail environment. And so far, we are encouraged by the results. The improvement in our volume\/mix trends reflect a combination of gains from Big Bets in condiments and sauces even with the results of Russia, as well as improving consumption in shared trends across most countries, including positive overall consumption in the UK. Net EBITDA, the decline we saw in Q4 and throughout the year was from a combination of pricing and increased marketing to drive our Big Bets and whitespace initiatives and in Q4, higher overhead cost due to timing, which we don't expect to repeat. These factors more than offset manufacturing savings realized during the year.","Finally, our Rest of the World segment on slide 8. Here, the underlying drivers of organic growth were fairly consistent throughout the year. Higher pricing was primarily driven by price increases to offset higher input cost in local currency, mainly in Latin America. And vol\/mix growth was driven by strong years in China and Latin America, and solid performance in Australia and in Japan with the strong overall growth in condiments and sauces across all regions. Some challenges still remain, including Indonesia soy sauce and some difficult economic conditions to overcome in India and the Middle East. But overall, as we said in our last call, after seeing a slight deceleration in Q3, we continue to expect strong growth in our rest of the world business, both in the near-term and long-term.","Net EBITDA, as we also mentioned on our last call, in Q4, we faced a strong comparison to the prior year. And we are investing heavily behind whitespace initiatives. This led to the decline in adjusted EBITDA we saw in Q4 in the second half of the year. For the full year, EBITDA growth was primarily driven by organic sales growth that was partially offset by increased marketing investments to support new products.","Now, before we go to our agenda for 2017, I think it's also important to highlight the significant progress we made in 2016 to improve our capital structure and credit metrics. The first point I will make on slide 9 is that our focus on cash is paying off. We generated approximately $1 billion of cash from working capital improvements, mainly driven by an increase in payables and tight management of inventories. In fact, we were able to achieve negative working capital by the end of the year, equal to negative 1.6% of sales, down from 4.5% of sales at the end of last year.","And we did this while increasing safety stock in an effort to de-risk our footprint activity. We also redeemed our preferred debt resulting roughly $550 million of annual after-tax cash savings for the company. In terms of leverage, we've also made similar significant progress in short period of time improving our credit metrics. Through a combination of EBITDA growth and refinancing, we've reduced our leverage from approximately 4.5 times EBITDA at the time of the merger to 3.6 times at the end of 2016. We remain confident in our ability to fully deleverage in 2017 to bring us closer to our ultimate goal of below three times leverage. And we remain committed to paying down $2 billion of debt when it comes due in July and holding off on any share repurchase plans until that pay down is complete.","Beyond our deleveraging goals, our priorities of ongoing financial policy and use of free cash flow are straightforward. First, maintain an investment grade credit rating. Second, fund a highly competitive dividend. And third, deploy excess cash against opportunity on a risk-adjusted return basis, which bring us to our agenda for 2017.","And I'll hand back to Bernardo to start it off.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Paulo. Let me start by saying that 2016 was a solid year for our company. We made a great deal of progress in realizing our potential. But we still have a lot to improve in order to deliver our expectation for 2017. In 2017, we enter year two of our multi-year merger plan. Headwinds remain from highly competitive retail markets to persistent foreign exchange headwind, especially in Europe. So at the top of our agenda is an even sharper focus on profitable organic sales growth. By that, I mean that we will focus our investments in innovation, renovation and marketing on our leading brands, along with prioritizing fewer, bigger and bolder bets within our portfolio.","These will include expanding our core by innovating into adjacent categories and new segments, where Kraft Heinz brand have the ability to win. It also includes Big Bets in existing categories by aggressively targeting on-trend segment where you're currently under indexed, such as the 2016 bet we laid in the U.S. natural cheese. For competitive reasons, we do not have a list of key initiatives to provide today, but we will certainly highlight them as we roll them out in the coming quarters.","And finally, globally, we're focusing on three key brands: Heinz, Kraft and Planters, and in five categories with global potential; condiments and sauces, cheese, meals, nuts and baby food. The emphasis within these opportunities will be to increase investment levels and improve execution, which includes applying best practice for wining in each channel, from traditional retail and discounters to foodservice, and over time e-commerce. All this will be fueled by significant incremental investment in marketing, both for market capabilities and product development, covering North America, Europe and rest of the world.","Our agenda also includes achieving best-in-class operating efficiency with top quality. We plan to reduce complexity through active assortment management in United States, an achieve best in class operations efficiency and quality within our manufacturing facility. Also great execution begins with great training and we are actively building a new methodology and training platform to support our performance-driven organization.","But let met turn it back to Paulo to wrap-up by explaining how our agenda will translate into 2017 financial performance.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, Bernardo. In terms of cost savings, we are now targeting net integration program savings of $1.7 billion by the end of 2017, up from $1.5 billion previously. Keep in mind that we achieved cumulative savings of approximately $1.2 billion through the end of 2016.","And note that our new target is net of an approximately $300 million negative impact in 2017 from a combination of business reinvestments and additional non-key commodity inflation that were not contemplated at the time of the merger. To achieve these new targets, we expect cost to achieve of $2 billion, up from $1.9 billion previously. This includes $1.2 billion in pre-tax cash P&L costs, as well as CapEx of $1.3 billion.","Finally, we expect to deliver a strong EPS growth, driven by EBITDA gains and further accretion from the preferred refinancing. EBITDA growth is likely to be driven, primarily by incremental integration savings in North America, as well as strong organic top-line growth in our Rest of World markets. In addition, our earnings expectations currently reflect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% and assume no change in existing tax regimes and regulations.","As far as seasonality throughout the year, our 2017 plan reflects aggressive upfront investment in growth followed by significant second half savings from footprint initiatives. In addition, please note that several factors will hold back first quarter organic net sales and EBITDA. They include a shift in higher margin Easter shipments to Q2 2017 versus Q1 2016, upfront investments in innovation and whitespace in a number of geographies, as well as our expectation that additional integration related savings will be second half oriented. That being said, we do expect 2017 will be another year of strong sustainable profit growth for The Kraft Heinz Company and another significant step forward in realizing our potential.","Thank you. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just have two things, if I could. One is you talk about profitable organic sales growth going forward, a sharpening of focus on that. I guess how should we externally measure the company against that goal of profitable sales growth? Is there a minimum amount of growth and sort of EBITDA margin that \u2013 or a combination of those two that we can use as, let's say, measuring sticks to assess the execution on this goal?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. This is Paulo. So we aren't going to provide like a target on this. But the way that we see this profitable organic growth is that through our innovation process and through our all the initiatives that we're handling here in the company we expect to have sales that really move down to EBITDA over time.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then if we think about \u2013 I guess if we think about the North American business investments that you talk about, that I think you mentioned were not contemplated at the time of the merger. Trying to get a sense of sort of exactly what you mean by netted out of the synergy? And should we take from that that the cost of growth essentially is more significant than you might have thought at the time of the merger or how should we put that business investment step up in context?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Andrew. It's Paulo again. So what we're talking about here is that in the first half the business investment is pretty much investment that we're doing in quality improvements for the products, renovation, marketing pullout, new products, and more Big Bets. We're investing behind both markets to improve the retail execution that we have and also now expanded distribution in our foodservice segment. And, again, all of these investments, we were not contemplating to do that. We saw the opportunity to do this now and we're executing this. And just to be clear that we always decided to provide a savings target that was net of everything, so we're keeping doing this. We're just highlighting that we found more opportunities in the business and we're executing this. But, again, our target of $1.7 billion is still net of all of these investments.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula from UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everyone. Good revenue quarter. So, quick question, kind of like following up with Andrew. The timing of the factory closures, it seems like some of that is getting \u2013 taking a little bit longer than maybe expected or maybe we mismanaged how it would flow into the year. So, does that mean there is some kind of tail effect of cost savings dipping into early 2018? That'd be my first question.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Steve. This is George. I will take this question. Our manufacturing modernization program is on track to deliver updated technology and low cost production. We are now in the peak activity and won't be past that peak until late 2017, as I shared on the last call. We remain in line with expectation and on budget to deliver what we shared with you on prior call.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, my other question would be related to pricing. We definitely saw very strong volume. So, George, if you could help us understand, would the U.S. business organically still have been positive ex, call it, the trade shift? And should we think about \u2013 with price\/mix being just below flat this quarter should we start to see that improve as you think through revenue management initiatives for the Kraft portfolio this year? And also you're saying that commodity prices might be bottoming, if you could help us think through that, that would be great?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. Pricing for Q4 was in line with our strategy all along and in line with our expectation. And you'd probably saw both sides of revenue management at work, the side where we went dark in some categories, and the side where we went heavy in other categories and we're very happy with the results that we got. The reason we do that, Steve, is that lift on promotion, that traditional lift where you put a promotion and you measure the growth that it's no longer what it used to be. So we have to resort to a number of levers to be able to maintain volume. We tried a number of things in Q4. We are very happy with the results. And that would be reflected moving forward. So that's what you want to expect from us. Some category we're going to move harder. Others we would move softer. All in all, we will manage our revenues always to be ahead to improve our margins.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just two questions from me. One is your thinking about \u2013 as we're looking at 2017 and at some point later this year, you'll start to begin the process I guess of repatriating some of the Kraft brands licenses from Mondel\u0113z. Is there anything that you're doing in 2017 and maybe spending ahead of that or anything in there that affects that we should be thinking about in terms of 2017 growth or performance?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan. Good afternoon, this is Bernardo. Look, about the repatriation, you're right, there would be the brands coming back to us in January 2018, and there is some work to be done in preparation. But from a cost standpoint or from a revenue standpoint, there is really no benefit or impact in the year, right. There is preparation from marketing, from distribution, from our manufacturing capabilities to hit the ground and be running, but I don't think there will be an impact to \u2013 on the cost or the revenue for the repatriation efforts.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of housekeeping items, can you give us now a sense of what we should look for D&A for this year, depreciation and amortization, interest expense? And maybe just how we should think about transactional foreign exchange?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Bryan. This is Paulo. So, starting from the D&A, we are in Q4 \u2013 we're today in a related Q4, $135 million, that's where we are today, so this would take us in $440 million next year. And on top of that, we believe that we're going to have additional $50 million because of the footprint investment that we are doing during 2016.","And it looks the interest rates is pretty much our \u2013 we have an average cost of debt of 2.9% per year, roughly $32 billion in gross debt, so this would be around $1.3 billion in interest rate. And again, we expect this to come down a little bit once we pay the $2 billion debt that we're going to have in the mid of the year.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","So this is pretty much D&A interest expense. Regarding the transaction FX, now we are expecting to see some headwinds in Europe. But again I think our team \u2013 our local team is taking the right measures there to have a balanced approach in terms of setting these with price, and also \u2013 but also getting the best distribution and sales position to offset that. It's important to \u2013 again to remember that Europe for us is 4% of the business and UK is around 0.5% of that.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank","Good evening, everyone. I just have one simple question just on your pointing to the three core brands, and kind of the five core categories globally. So is the expectation, I guess mainly in 2017 as you plan to invest more in certain areas of opportunity in North America. Considering it is still about 75%, three-quarters of your EBITDA. Is the expectation that that investment will be in North America in those brands, and then later you would invest more so in those three core brands on a global basis, so you start in the U.S., but then you expect to continue investing in those brands globally to gain scope, then hopefully improve returns, or we just stick with the investment in North America for now because that's really where the majority of the cash flow is coming?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Rob. This is Bernardo. I think, it was important to highlight that, just to give a sense of the direction of the focusing looking at three global brands and five top categories that really, when you mix all them represent 70% of the business, and you're going to move forward. That is United States and North America like I mentioned, but also worldwide. And so I don't think there is a distinction really in the amount of investment between U.S. and international. They will be \u2013 they'll be moving together. They'll pursue different states and different \u2013 what the business is by country and by region, but as a focus looking mid-term, those are the ones. I think, it's important in your question also to highlight that our business is a balance between global brands and local brands. Global brands having the strength and the scale to grow multi-categories and multi-regions; and the local jewelry (39:49) like we like to call customizing to consumer needs on local markets and regions.","So we are really happy with our portfolio and the balance we have today between the global brands and local brands, and the specific categories. But those three global, we're calling global brands, in those five categories is really what's going to push us to the next level that we're calling this balance towards profitable growth. I don't think there is a distinction between investment in North America or internationally. It would be case-by-case depending on the state of the business at the regional level.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to make sure I understood how the savings will flow through as you build up to $1.7 billion. If I assume that things kind of stay the way they are in the first half of 2017, you would still have quite a bit of benefit versus first quarter a year ago and second quarter a year ago. In fact, I could argue that that gives you the best tailwind in first quarter, but you are guiding to a weaker first quarter. So can I understand like do you expect first quarter to be like your weakest EBITDA growth quarter because of these other Easter factors and such? Or is that offset just by the easy comparison on the saves? Thanks.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Rob. This is Paulo. So I think I hear two questions here. So in terms of how the savings will flow through our P&L in 2017, yeah, as we're seeing with this new, this updated guidance we're giving, we're seeing more savings come in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.","This is pretty much driven by two things is: one, that we're having the investments that are inside the savings number, as I mentioned before, in the first half of the year; and two, there is addition of saves that we found also is going to start more in the second half of the year as we expected today. So that's one thing.","In terms of seasonality, in terms of Q1 versus the full year next year, I think the three things that we are mentioning here I think is, first of all, the Easter shift Q1 versus Q2; and this break down of this savings flow that we expect the first half of the year where we're going to have more investments and in the back half of the year we're going to have more net savings, as I've just explained to you. So I think those are the two points that I would like to make.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. But just to clarify, the investments are included in that net savings number. So does that mean \u2013 fourth quarter you had about $345 million of net savings. Could it possibly go down in first quarter because of the investments sequentially?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","I don't want to give the guidance break down by quarter. But again, we always believe that we are adding initiatives in savings and we're adding also investments. So we believe that our savings are going to ramp up throughout the year.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Just want to make sure we're aligned, but thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good afternoon and thank you. Can you just confirm \u2013 I think I caught this, but one of the five categories you said you would focused on, I think it was baby food and you clearly have a smaller footprint there now. I think it's mostly Italy and a little bit in China. When you talk about that as a white space opportunity, is that just organically or would you consider M&A to be a part of that as well?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Michael. Look, we always look with this, the way that we think the categories and the brand, we always look and think about profitable and organic growth. So the way you're directing here is all organic. And the reason for that is actually you're right to say it's true. A small part in the total portfolio, but very relevant in many countries important for us, including Canada, including Australia, including the UK, for sure Italy like you mentioned, for sure China, Mexico, you're getting to Brazil, Russia that's the biggest category we have there.","So when you see all this, even the small presence, where we have a presence it's significant through the Heinz brand most part of the time, sometimes local brands like Plasmon in Italy and so on. And we believe there is a lot of opportunities, like you said, in whitespace geography, again, country-by-country, region-by-region. There is a role that can be played and we want to look at that with the right expectation.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just one other clarification on 1Q. You talked about the Easter shift and the higher investments and the savings pacing being more back-half loaded. Is the Easter shift \u2013 that seems more like it affects a shift into 2Q? You also talked about the trade loading in helping 4Q. Is that also potentially one of the headwinds in 1Q or do you think that was that more a pipeline fill for new products or something that might not have as much of a drag on 1Q?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Michael, George here. So as I said in my earlier remark, we have two things that will affect the first Q. One is the Easter shift. And, normally, we put that at just over 1%, 1% to 1.5%, something like that. And the second one that is unique to this year. Because of the strong promotional activities that we've had in the month of December, we put a lot of inventory to support that. That inventory is working its way off in January. And as I said in my remarks, that would be about a 0.5 point. So that will be, to give you an idea, what are the headwinds we will be facing in Q1. One of them is the shift between Q1 and Q2 and the other one is a one-off due to the inventory work-off.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two for me. First, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty in general right now regarding U.S. tax law, currency exchange rates, et cetera. So I'm curious if that uncertainty \u2013 to what degree does it affect your desire, your ability to pull a trigger on a next deal whatever that might be because obviously it's more challenging than usual for any company, not just you, to forecast cash flow for any potential target in this kind of environment? I'm just curious is the macro uncertainty high on your list? It's not really high on your list of concerns. How do you think about that when you think about potential M&A going forward?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken. This is Paulo. So, again, I think, first of all, we don't need another acquisition to drive value. And, again, as Bernardo mentioned, we have brands that can sell well. We have a lot of whitespace in front of us. And, again, we are going to evaluate any opportunity that makes sense for the company, that creates value for the company. But again, as a matter of practice we don't comment on possible opportunities.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But you can't comment even on the general way of thinking about it?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","I prefer not to comment on how so and hypotheticals.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Paulo, you've talked to us in the past, maybe the answer is no comment here as well, but I'll try anyway. You've talked to us in the past about how important it is for this vehicle, The Kraft Heinz, to have, I think in your worlds, iconic brands. And I'm just trying to get a sense, not in an M&A sense, but given what you have already. Why is this quality so critical? Why do you value it so heavily? Really what does it mean to Kraft? I'm just trying to get a sense for maybe why certain assets with I guess call it good brands that maybe don't qualify in your mind as iconic wouldn't be a great fit for what you're trying to do?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Ken, what we've always said is that we believe that we like a lot the industry and we believe that the most valuable asset and the most valuable asset that we have, the asset that gives us the most competitive advantage are the brands. So we value a lot the brands that we own, so that was pretty much the mention I made at that time.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","We think it's very important, very strong brand in the portfolio.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for carving out some time for me. Appreciate it. Congratulations on a strong year in totality. A couple questions for me. First, the pricing of the commodities benefit for the year. Where did we stack and rack as the year finished out?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Jason, this is Paulo. So when we said in terms of the commodity, we said that in 2016 we had a deflationary year. We mentioned at the beginning \u2013 not the beginning, in the mid of the year that we would expect this benefit to stay but it didn't. And in 2017, when we take a look at the spot and forward rates, we're likely to see year-over-year inflation. And we're already seeing that in cheese, coffee, bacon, as George mentioned. So that's what we are today.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Any specificity in terms of the benefit though, that PNOC benefit for the year?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. So, if you think about what we saw in Q4, we had \u2013 definitely we had benefit in price in our results in Q4. But as we're implementing revenue management, key commodity costs are just one of the inputs of our category strategy. And separating the impact of price or PNOC from the variances of the commodity is not as informative as it used to be. So I can say that we had a price benefit in our results in Q4, but I think separate the price initiatives that we had from PNOC is not as informative as it used to be.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I think that's a great point, because some of the skeptics out there are going to take the EBITDA growth, they're going to take the synergy number, they're going to back it out, they're going to take the PNOC benefit to at least the first three quarters, back it out, give you credit for currency, and point to an underlying EBITDA decline, net of those benefits, all-in.","And say, maybe that's sort of the underlying rate. This is excluding the savings and sort of net savings of $500 million next year. The underlying business is flat to down. And when those savings run out, the business will fall off. And certainly, if you look at consensus, consensus right now is modeling more than $500 million of EBITDA growth next year. So they're going to view that with some degree of skepticism, given you only have $500 million of savings in the underlying soft.","What's wrong with that line of thinking or is there some validity in that line of thinking? And how should we be thinking about the underlying business, even absent sort of the cost saves on the forward?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Now, when you think about our model \u2013 our overall model, we always \u2013 always as I said, we expect growth coming from Rest of the World. We have the savings flowing through, and you have our other initiatives, revenue management, we have investment in new products that we're doing to boost our sales and our results.","So it's a bunch of initiatives that we have that will compound our results for next year and the following years.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein Research.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hey, good evening.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So for investors last quarter, there was a concern about the trends in Europe, and I think things have changed over there, but that's still an element of concern. Basically, that's the legacy Heinz business that you've now owned for a little over three years. This time around the EBITDA still shrinking, I guess attributed to some step-ups and timing of overhead spending. How you \u2013 how can you address the concern that that European business and maybe particularly the UK seems to be slipping? How much were those overhead timing effect this time around, and when do you expect that business to gain some traction again? Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Alexia, it's Bernardo. Like we mentioned in the last call and continue to be, the point, our goal in Europe is to return to profitable growth. We really think that our performance \u2013 that was a weak performance in 2016 and Europe has absolutely no correlation with the cost side and like you mentioned the overhead, I think, there was a lot of correlation on the stakes, on the go-to-market and things on the promo side, volume mix that didn't work out as we showed, and what we are actually encouraged about is when you see the Q4, the performance by all the business, especially the Benelux and the UK had improved significant looking at sell out consumption, looking at share on the main category, soup, beans, sauces, and you already have 70% of renovation for the year ready in the market.","So the results from the Q4 plus what you're seeing now in January moving into February, I really encouraged by a much better performance 2017 in Europe than you had 2016. Still going to be challenged, the retail environment is challenged like the density (54:59) between FX rate and everything that's happening in the continent. But that being said, I think the performance Q4 is really encouraging about we can have a better performance looking at 2017, than our weak performance in 2016.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Will you be able to get some EBITDA growth at some point in Europe? I guess the question is, yes, the top-line is improving. But at what cost, that's the question I am getting.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Look again, when we talk about profitable growth and like Paulo mentioned in the beginning, our idea of sales mix, really sales flowing to the bottom line. We have no intention of gaining sales without profitability. Component that come attached to that. There are investments that needs to be done in the marketing side and in go-to-market side that I think we have been doing and we'll continue to do it. But that being said, if we're able to create profitable growth sales in Europe that should come also with a better performance in the bottom line.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Shall we take maybe one more question?","Operator","Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good evening. I just had two quick ones for you. I wanted to ask if I could first, with reference to the revenue management program, is that contingent on capital investments and footprint rationalization such that we wouldn't see much of that benefit until the second half of the year or does that program sort of kick in early in the year.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Chris, thank you. This is George. We've been working on establishing the revenue management program infrastructure, processes, and the benefit of it for quite some times now. And as we said in a number of key items we saw that what we used to call our pricing strategy or pricing commodity or trade spend. All of it now is part of our revenue management program. So we're not separating where the efficiency is coming from. So the best, it works best for us just in the investment in the footprint, but more in investment in brands and particularly in building the brand equity as we invest in marketing activity, as we invest in new products, as we invest in renovations like taking out official stuff out like what we did with Mac & Cheese, what we did with frozen meals. You see categories that were declining at double-digit. Now they're all of a sudden increasing at high single-digits. So that's giving us the power to one, price and two, the ability to increase household penetration, so renovation of product and innovation of product. So that's for us is the better working model.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one quick one, I think for Paulo. You talked about in the quarter some incremental investments. I believe marketing was up in the quarter as well as some of the overhead timing. Could you quantify those in anyway percentages or give us any idea of how much that could have burdened the fourth quarter?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. So when you think about the Q4, North America, EBITDA increase that we have, the majority of the EBITDA came from savings. We also had, as I said, some benefit coming from price in our EBITDA and this timing of overhead that each of them offset each other then they're both in the range of $50 million. That's what we saw.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Jakubik for any closing comments.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Well, thank you, everybody for joining us this afternoon.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update for the second quarter of 2016. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO; Paulo Bas\u00edlio, our CFO; and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. commercial business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now, let's turn to slide two, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For much of today's call we'll concentrate on second quarter numbers. I think it's good to start by providing an update to the progress we have to bring Kraft and Heinz together over the past year.","Let's return to the three objectives of our strategy which were laid out at the beginning of our merger. First, deliver profitable sales growth. Second, achieve and maintain best-in-class margins. And third, capture a superior return of capital as an investment-grade company.","On our last call I said that we're off to a good start. Good. Not great. And I think that's how I should describe the first half of the year as well. It's true when you look at our top line performance and our progress in delivering profitable sales growth. The investments we have made in our global sauces franchise continued to improve category growth or market share gains in United States, Canada and Europe. It's also the primary driver of the nearly 9% organic sales growth in our Rest of the World segment during the first six months of 2016. Our Big Bets investments and whitespace initiatives are starting to gain traction in markets around the globe and we have more to talk about in the second half. George will talk about our performance in the West, including the impact of our Mac & Cheese renovation.","Outside the U.S., the March launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise was able to help us grow our business and our market share in every market where we have put it on the shelf. These Big Bets and new products are critical for us given the consumption headwinds in a number of markets and in a number of key categories.","As an industry we are in an environment where retail competition is intensified in our biggest and most mature markets, including the United States, Canada, the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia. Nowhere this is more true than the U.K. where key category declines have been at significant drag in the first half even though our market share trends have been improving.","In this market, we must remain disciplined with our go-to-market activities, constantly balancing price, promotion and distribution while we innovate to build our brands and drive profitable growth. And as we have seen, this sometimes leads to a bumpy ride on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","But our biggest challenge remains the fact that you continue to have a number of categories where consumption trends are working against us. And while we're making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance going forward, our organic sales growth during the first half of the year was held back. Specifically in two of our biggest segments, we were down on an organic basis. Down roughly 1% for the first half in the United States, and down 3% in Europe, resulting in 0.3% total company organic growth for the first six months. So as far as top line goes, like I said, okay, not great.","In terms of our second objective to achieve best class in margins, we have made significant progress in the first six months of the year with adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 20% or just over 25% on a constant currency basis. These have been driven by a combination of savings for our integration program, commodities favorability in North America, as well as a strong organic sales growth in the Rest of the World segment.","In terms of our integration program, we delivered roughly $300 million of savings in Q2. But I am even happier to report that in Q2 we put the critical step behind us, one of the more risky activities we had in our agenda, that was the integration of the legacy Kraft and the legacy Heinz front office SAP models in North America. So now we are one face to our customers as a system-integrated company and we did this while keeping our K-through rate (6:55) United States on target at 98%, with minor service issues in food service already addressed.","In fact, we had very good execution around the world in Q2. With Europe remaining above its K-through rate (7:09) target at more than 99%, Canada at 97% and our Rest of the World segment for the first time above 96%. Importantly, none of this would be possible without bringing our performance driven culture to life.","I know that on our last call that our Manage by Objectives, our MBO process, now covered roughly 6,000 employees worldwide. In Q2, we took another important step, launching our Ownerversity, a new global learning platform to support our culture, accelerate our vision and values and help employees constantly delivering on our MBOs. Kraft Heinz Ownerversity provides consistent training foundation across the organization.","Last but not least, as part of our third objective, we have taken significant further actions to deliver a superior return of capital and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may have seen during Q2 we closed the redemption and refinancing of our preferred stock, an important step in strengthening our investment grade credit standing. In fact, with our Q2 results, our leverage ratio is now just below four times EBITDA based on our latest 12 months of results and are on our way to achieving the goal, three times ratio we were targeting over the middle term.","And finally, as we saw today, our board of directors set a 4.3% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.60 per share. So overall, we have made meaningful progress against the objectives of our strategy that will help lay the foundation for better execution and profitable growth going forward.","Let's now turn to slide three to see what that means for Q2 financial results. On the top line, similar to Q1, we saw a foreign exchange drag of 4%. On an organic basis, however, net sales were down 0.5%. Pricing was up 1.6 percentage points, reflecting gains in all regions but Europe. And despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada, primarily in dairy and coffee.","Volume\/mix fell 2.1 percentage points, as lower shipments, particularly meat and food service in the United States more than offset gains from innovation in Lunchables and P3 in the U.S. and solid volumes of condiment and sauces globally.","And EBITDA we drove the strong dollar growth and margin performance both year-over-year and sequentially from Q1, despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3 2015. This was driven by a combination of, one, our strong cost savings performance, favored pricing relative to key commodity cost over the prior period and profitable top line growth.","At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 39.3% versus the prior period to $0.85, reflecting the leverage of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth playing through the P&L.","Now I will hand it over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did it in each reporting segment and what to expect going forward. George?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide four for a quick update of our performance in the United States.","If you recall at the start of the year, I described one of our goals as delivering stable top line performance during a year of significant transformation. And so far that's what we have done.","We've been able to maintain solid momentum in the marketplace in a number of categories that we placed Big Bets on with new products and\/or advertising support. This includes Heinz sauces, which grew at mid-single digits, driven by the introduction of barbecue sauce, year two of mustard and the share growth of ketchup; Philadelphia Cream Cheese, ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts; and Lunchables, which are all growing at mid- to high-single digits.","However, these gains were more than offset by weak consumption trends in categories like roast and ground coffee, frozen nutritional meals and hot dogs. On one hand there are no new major categories that I would add to this list. On the other hand, we do need to move faster to adjust in the marketplace and ensure that these challenging categories do not mask the successes we are achieving with our Big Bets innovations and investments in marketing.","Our new product initiatives for 2016 are working well, particularly the renovation of Kraft Mac & Cheese and Capri Sun ready-to-drink organic beverage, the introduction of Heinz Barbecue Sauces, and the introduction of Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese.","The second factor I would highlight is that our Q2 shipments were consistent with measured channels consumption, in line with our expectation from our last call. And you may have seen recent SCANA data was affected by the timing of the 4th of July holiday versus the prior year. Adjusting for that, our consumption would have been down roughly 2% in the second quarter. So shipments were essentially in line with consumption.","I would also note that we continue to add new business, or whitespace, in both food service and non-traditional retail channel during the second quarter. However, food service was down versus prior year in Q2 due to program timing with customers, incremental commodity-related price decline as well as minor service level problems during the quarter.","Which brings me to our integration program execution. During the quarter, the bulk of our integration activity shifted to supply chain and operations activities, including an SAP integration go-live, which was completed in the quarter. Thus far, our service levels remain good for most of our product groups, with some challenges in the cold cut segment of our meat business as well as minor disruptions in food service in the month of May that was quickly corrected. Overall, as Bernardo mentioned, our savings are coming in faster than planned; and we are achieving these savings without sacrificing quality.","For the balance of the year, our key objectives will be two-fold. First, we must continue to execute our footprint integration while minimizing disruption. Second, we will step up our in-store activity, including a strong agenda of new product introduction we have planned for the second half. Look for new product introductions in our desserts, cheese and frozen categories in the months ahead, which follow the rollout of our new Devour frozen meal this past month.","As I hope you can see, it is an exciting time for Kraft Heinz in the United States. Our plate is full, and our opportunity for profitable growth is significant. Our job is to deliver in the marketplace.","With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide five and add a few notes on Q2 financials in the U.S.","With organic growth pricing was up 1.2 percentage points, primarily due to lower promotional activity versus the prior year and despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities. Volume\/mix fell 3.1 percentage points, reflecting ongoing gains from innovations like Lunchables and P3, and strong volumes from our Mac & Cheese renovation that were more than offset by lower shipments in key categories but strongest in food service and, as George noted, in our meats category.","In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, as mentioned in our Q1 call, this was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable price relative to lower key commodity costs. While it was being seen the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the past couple of quarters, we continue to expect commodities favorability to fade as we move forward.","Let's turn to slide six where the key factors impacting Canada in the second quarter were essentially the same as what we saw in Q1. We still saw strong currency headwinds, but the negative 5 percentage point impact from currency in Q2 was half that seen in Q1. Organically, we were able to deliver net sales growth from pricing gains exceeding the related decline in volume\/mix.","Positive pricing of 3.1% was the result of significant pricing to offset higher product costs in local currency, and this more than offset pricing headwinds related to deflation in select key commodities. Volume\/mix went down 1.9 percentage points, primarily from a decline in cheese due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q2 last year as well as lower coffee and ready-to-drink beverage shipments.","Adjusted EBITDA was up 27.2% versus the year-ago period, despite a negative 7.2 percentage point impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable timing of pricing relative to higher local input costs that were partially offset by unfavorable volume\/mix. Similar to Q1, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this quarter in Canada. However, I would note that some of the upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus local input costs.","Moving forward and with official raw milk prices now on the rise in Canada, we would not expect the commodity favorability in the first half of this year to show up in coming quarters.","That brings us to Europe on slide seven. On our last call, I said that we felt better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate, specifically in terms of profitability. On the Q2 top line, as we saw with Q1 versus Q4, organic net sales growth was again better on a sequential basis. Organic net sales were still down, and down largely due to an increase in promotional activity in U.K. condiments and sauces versus the prior-year period. But our volume\/mix trend kept improving, reflecting gains from condiments and sauces in most countries that were offset by lower shipments versus the prior year in the U.K.","At the same time, while constant currency EBITDA in Europe was down slightly versus prior year, margins were up, both sequentially and versus the prior year. This was driven by a mix of manufacturing savings, lower pricing and an increase in market investments. So while we are not all the way out of the woods, the health of our European business is indeed better than our Q1 numbers might have indicated, and we are continuing to invest in profitable growth as we move forward.","Finally, we will look at the Rest of the World on slide eight. Here, foreign currency was again a significant headwind, roughly 24%, mainly due to recognizing the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of Q2 2015.","In terms of organic growth, we saw high-single digit organic net sales growth, driven by a good balance of volume\/mix and pricing. Pricing of 5% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume\/mix was up 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions.","As to EBITDA, we saw an 8.8% decline in adjusted EBITDA to a negative 34.5 percentage point impact from currency, 27.5 percentage points of which was from the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q2, driven by strong organic growth. That covers our Q2 results.","And before we go to the Q&A, I want to quickly update our expectations for financial performance over the near to medium term. From an organic sales perspective, I think it's important to echo Bernardo's and George's thoughts. That is, we would expect from both an industry perspective and a Kraft Heinz perspective that consumer trends in an increasingly competitive retail environment are likely to remain headwinds in both North America and Europe. We remain confident in our pipeline of Big Bets, and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both food services and international channels. However, as you have all seen, our starting point in most mature markets is declining consumption. And therefore, we have much work to do to simply get back to positive organic sales growth.","As far as our integration program, all of our targets remain the same: savings and cost to achieve. And we are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion net of inflation in 2017. Below the line, the redemption of our preferred stock and related financing with new debt is expected to benefit EPS growth in the second half. As a result of the new debt issuance at today's currency rates, we expect our run rate net interest expense to be approximately 3.8% of the roughly $33 billion of gross debt outstanding at the end of Q2.","So that's our update through the second quarter of 2016. We still have significant work ahead to realize our potential and set the stage for profitable growth in the future. We have a strong Big Bet pipeline with a strong agenda for the second half, and further whitespace opportunities to go after. At the same time, our footprint integration activity is expected to reach its peak in the second half of the year as well.","And as we've said before in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption. Making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis for the remainder of the year. So while we have had a solid start to the year, we must continue to execute well against the many opportunities we have to deliver profitable growth.","Thank you. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Hollis (sic) [Howard] (26:15) of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Good evening.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good evening, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can I ask you about your revenue management practices, what you've found out so far, what innings you're in with that? It's something that everybody is talking about across the industry, as you optimize promotional spending and price points. Is there a lot more in there?","And linked to that, I'm getting from investors that people are worried that the relationship with the retailers may be weakening as you pull back on some of that promotional activity. How do you respond to that at this point? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Alexia. This is George here. I'll take these questions. First, if you're wondering which inning we are in, we are in the pregame. So what we have done in revenue management, we have established the infrastructure to manage across 30 to 40 categories in the U.S. What you have seen so far is not what we have realized from revenue management. This is yet to come. What you have seen so far, some improvement due to minimization of negative ROI promotional activities. And not going into large, deep discounting promotional activity.","Also what you have seen probably, the availability of merchandising has reduced at retailers, which means the average price per pound has gone up. So that's what you have seen.","The relationship with retailers is very strong. We work as straight partners, because we're both in the industry here to serve the consumers that is changing rapidly.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Feeney of Consumer [Edge] Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good evening. Thanks very much for the question. Kind of a follow-up question. I wanted to ask how you measure returns on investment on the promotional activity you're speaking of, this reduced promotional activity. Because presumably there's a loyalty algorithm, where you generate repeat behavior, future periods. Whether in some of your more commodity influenced categories, like meat or the portfolio more broadly.","But we've read and heard at a recent conference how loyal usage is down. And that might alter that math. So I'm wondering how you think about that repeat behavior and that future, those future potential maybe habitual dollars you might get, or you might lose by managing down those promotional opportunities. Thanks.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Jon, thank you for your question. George again. I will take this question. Really there are a number of variables, and they're not the same by category. It depends on our position, whether we are the market leader, and how we measure our relative market share, the brand equity strength, and the ability to price, and the relative market share to other competitors in the market. That's one piece driven by consumer demand.","And the second piece is our profitability posture. And depending on where commodity pricing at. So it is not one thing that fit all. It depends on a number of variables.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","But \u2013 thank you. But I guess in your management of promotion, George, would you have done the same thing with this portfolio five years ago as far as managing those promotions? Or is it variables that have changed in the marketplace recently that are leading you to maybe, say, that you have a negative ROI on what were perhaps positive ROI promotions before? I'd just like to understand that.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","No, the difference between now and five years ago is consumers' attitude towards brands and category has changed significantly. And the availability of merchandising has reduced. So you wouldn't have done these things five years ago. So \u2013 and that's not due to the way we operate or we measure promotion, rather due to the changes around us in the marketplace.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, George, just to add, I think you answered very properly the question here of Jon and Alexia. I just wanted to add, when you talk about revenue management, I think it's important to understand that that's the tool in connection to a lot of things that are happening in the marketplace. So it's never in itself in isolation. You're going to be looking at promotions, but you look at market share, you look at innovation, you look at the relationships, things you want to do to build the long-term of the brand. So for sure, we will be looking how we can manage our portfolio the best way possible. In that sense, the revenue or management piece is an important tool in the middle of several other ones. So I highly recommend you don't think about revenue management in isolation because it's never the case that we run the business anywhere.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your question, please.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just two things for me, I guess. First, I think you mentioned $300 million in synergies in the quarter. I guess on an annualized basis at $1.2 billion, but correct me if I'm wrong that you still have the bulk of the manufacturing synergies still to come, I guess, starting in the second half. So just trying to get a sense if the $1.5 billion you are pointing to starts to seem increasingly conservative or not based on some of the numbers I laid out.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Andrew, thanks. This is Paulo here. Right, we are just over $300 million in savings for the second quarter and again, if you annualize this number, you are going to get to roughly $1.2 billion which is around 80% of our current target for 2017 for $1.5 billion. The majority of the org and ZBB savings, they are already implemented although we are still expecting some more savings coming from the ZBB bucket. And again, going forward the majority of the savings that we expect for our plan will come from the footprint initiative that we have.","That being said, I think it's important to keep in mind that these savings they should also offset the expected inflation that we have for the following year. Our target is $1.5 billion net of inflation for 2017. And again, we will continue to update our expectations every quarter but no change in our estimates so far.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that clarity. And then I think last quarter you helped at least to dimensionalize the magnitude of the P-NOC (33:59) favorability in the first quarter. And I was wondering if there was a way you could help us a little bit maybe try and quantify that a bit in terms of how favorable that was this quarter as well?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, sure. When you think about our North America EBITDA growth, our North America EBITDA grew around $350 million. Again, just over $300 million came from the saves initiatives and the rest pretty much is coming from commodity favorability in the second quarter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon. Just wanted to follow up the comments you've made about how challenging the environment is and declining consumption. So I guess can you talk about how that might affect your planning over the next year or two versus originally in terms of where you reinvest or how much you reinvest? And then second, does it have any effect at all as you look out further and maybe other potential acquisitions, does it at all affect the way you are thinking about the returns in these markets given that declining consumption looks like it's going to be with us for a while? Thanks.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bryan. I will answer your question on the environment and I will pass it on to Bernardo to follow up the second part of the question. The challenging environment is nothing new. However, it accelerated a little bit over the past 12 months or so. And the way we are dealing with that is by investing more in new product development program in line with where consumer trends are now, and where they are going in the future. And we're increasing our investment and supporting our big brands. This is the best way to deal with consumer. The one thing we're not doing is throwing money to try to get quick sales. We are resisting that temptation, and we believe it's better for us in the long term to invest in sustainable growth.","As for the second part of the question, I'll pass it on to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bryan. I think the second part of your question about if that change or \u2013 and how this correlates to M&A there, I think George answered very well. We're excited about the perspective of the business. We have a lot to do here and it's still to fix some categories, to put more wood on the fire in a lot of categories, and to really push our agenda of profitable growth.","In respect to M&A, we really don't comment on the speculations and hypotheticals. As Paulo mentioned, our integration is going well but we still have important milestones to be overcome in the next 6 months to 12 months. But we're always going to be looking for further opportunities, but outside that we really don't comment.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But safe to say that the environment hasn't changed your perspective on value creation in this industry?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","No, it's not. We believe with and without acquisition we have a lot of value creation to be created in this business.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA. Your question, please.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah. I was wondering if you could just touch on innovation a little bit and two things in particular. One, some of these Big Bets, how many of those are legacy from, say, Kraft's pipeline pre the deal or have come to market since the acquisition from scratch? Just trying to get a sense of timing and how the approach works. And then just related to that a little bit, how do you think about when you do introduce a new brand versus an existing one like the (38:26) what caused you to think that it made sense to launch a new brand and the spending related to that as opposed to using one of the ones that you might have had already?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thank you for your question, Michael. A number of promotion \u2013 a number of new products started in the past 18 months, usually the cycle that it takes to do a new product and we have a stage and gate approach that we can sometimes accelerate and sometimes get project to drop off. That's the process that we have used. The Big Bets that we launched this year, they were in the former companies independently worked on, and we launched them in the Q1 and Q2. They weren't affected by any disruption from the integrations.","The three big ones for us this year have been the Heinz Barbecue Sauces, which was launched early this year and it's doing very well. The Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese, also another premium one, selling at a significant premium to the Kraft Mac & Cheese and it is our best-selling one out of the new product development. And Capri Sun Organic. To put something like this it takes \u2013 it takes at least 12 months, so they all started pre and during \u2013 and worked on during the merger.","We also launched a new brand called Devour, just launched it in the marketplace in frozen meals segment. And that was done about two months ago. And that was project that we started in late last year, so that happened after the merger. And we got to launch the brand and we're very excited about providing a big marketing support to launching that new brand. So the reality is some of them started before, some of them started after, none of them were affected or disrupted by integrating the two businesses together.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Have you had an ability to accelerate the launches just by removing some of the layers of management or by working with a leaner organization?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. You always have a faster decision making in an organization like ours.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you for your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, there. You've mentioned several times the risk of business disruption during the supply chain integration. And it comes to mind Oscar Mayer in particular for me, because I know that that closure in Wisconsin is particularly sensitive. And then you said cold cuts, I think there was some kind of disruption on cold cuts.","And I just wanted to know if you could tell me specifically where you're at in migrating that manufacturing? And what caused the disruption? And what you're doing to work your way through it?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Rob. First, I'm pleased to tell you that our service rate across Kraft Heinz in the United States has been really good. It's in the 98% CFR. We have the isolated issue in the cold cuts, where the demand and capacity are not matching during the footprint. And we would be over it very soon, and it's affecting our sliced meats business.","So we know what needs to be done. It's a capacity thing. And as we have new lines coming on-stream, that would be resolved over the longer term. So it is not something that will persist with us for a long period of time. We believe that the rest of the portfolio is in very, very good shape, some of the best CFRs I've ever seen in the rest of the portfolio.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, George. Can I ask a follow-up? I thought I heard several months ago that you were working on trying to improve manufacturing processes in cheese, so that you could provide retailers and consumers with fresher processed product, so it might taste better. Did I get that right? And I haven't heard much about it on the calls. And is there anything out there that's improving the quality of product that you have out there?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Rob, you may be referring to the Farm to Fridge Fresh in Six Days on the Philadelphia farm fresh campaign that we did. We put new technology. And we renovated a product segment over a year ago. And we are very, very pleased with the performance of this brand. It's sustaining a mid- to high-single digit growth, gaining market share from its already strong position. So that's one of the technologies. And we are putting new technologies on the other range to freshen up the product. But that's the one we referred to in previous call.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So there could be more to come in other lines within cheese?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Well, not just within cheese. We keep looking at every category within our portfolio and see what is it that we can do to improve the quality of our product and make product that consumer really want to consume.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. Two questions, if I may. First, on some of the problem children that you cited in the press release \u2013 or not in the press release, in some of the prepared remarks. I think you said ground coffee, some of your processed meat and frozen meals. You've given us innovation on frozen meals. You've given us some supply chain fixes on the processed meat side. Can you talk about what the planned fix, if anything, is on the ground coffee side?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Jason, for the question. Coffee, I always like to break down coffee into a number of segments, because we are seeing a tale of two worlds in coffee. One is the roast and ground coffee, and two is the pods coffee.","The pods is a very healthy business. And it's been growing now for years. However, the growth has subsided a little bit. It moved from the double-digits that we all used to see to mid-single digit growth. And that is a very healthy category. And as you know, we innovated greatly in this category over the past few years. And we continue to do so.","In roast and ground, the category has been in persistent decline for quite some time, as consumers are moving into the more premium and the pods business. The way we are dealing with this, we will bring some innovation to this category. But the bigger innovation is coming from pod. So that's where we think the growth will continue in the future.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. So effectively, category is migrating, you're going to migrate with it and just kind of suck it up on roast and ground. I think that's a fair paraphrasing.","The next question is on international. You've given us some details in terms of your Big Bets and you foreshadow \u2013 or you talked about one that's going to market now. There's been chatter of Planters going to China, chatter from the retail community in Brazil of heavy up-investing coming from you guys down there to support innovation. Can you give us a little walk around the world of what you've been able to do so far with Kraft brands abroad?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hi, Jason. It's Bernardo. I can answer this question. I think you're right. With 2016, we always said and continue to believe in the near that we are \u2013 we establish ourselves through the Kraft brand, establishing the supply chain, getting the foundation right so we can really push to the next steps 2017 and beyond. That being said, it's a reality today that Planters and Mac & Cheese in the U.K., that we're able to launch at the end of the first half and continue to gain distribution through the system in the U.K.","I have Planters with solid plans to arrive in China still this year. I have Mac & Cheese with solid plans to arrive in Brazil still this year. And I have a couple of other markets in Middle East and Europe that are focused on part of this \u2013 of this portfolio. Like we always said, we wanted to select fewer but big brands and segments in about 8 countries to 10 countries to establish ourselves in the next two years to three years in a big way and we continue to follow this path.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I really appreciate the incremental color. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for the session comes from Steve Strycula of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Quick question on cash flow, wanted to get an idea of, I think, this year is the peak CapEx year for yourselves, I was just wondering how should we think about with the majority of the footprint action being made this year, should we expect a step-down next year?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that's correct. We expect the majority of the CapEx initiatives from fruit remains (48:41) to be executed during the 2016.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then a quick follow-up question. When we think about the combination of Kraft and legacy Heinz, each asset base brings its own distinct qualities and functionality. I would like to know what you guys think longer term in terms of strategy, what makes the most incremental sense? Is it international distribution? Is it more U.S. cash flow? Is it exposure to faster growing categories? What do you think the portfolio needs from here?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve. Look, I don't think it's one or the other, right? I think George mentioned the (49:25) I was talking about expansion. We saw the best performance in the second quarter in Europe even in the first quarter even not being where we wanted to be. But when you see your question and given the footprint you have from a manufacturer's standpoint, I think we can believe and to the categories you operate that we can't push profitable growth through \u2013 in mature markets like U.S., Canada, Europe and also in more emerging markets in whitespace opportunities like Brazil, Russia, China and others. So I wouldn't select one or the other.","I think after the footprint activity, especially United States and Canada, we will have the capabilities given the investment we are making to really push an agenda of profitable growth so the market can be expanded and our supply chain will be able to cope with that.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any closing remarks. Sir?","Christopher M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our business update for the third quarter of 2015. With me today is Bernardo Hees, our Chief Executive Officer; Paulo Basilio, our Chief Financial Officer; and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release. We'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation within the earnings release we issued about an hour ago and in the Investor Center on our corporate website.","Before we get started, as you know, the merger between Kraft and Heinz to form the Kraft Heinz Company was completed on July 2, 2015. And therefore, this is the first time we've provided a business update as a combined company. So today, Bernardo, George and Paulo are going to provide some perspective on how we intend to run our business more generally, in addition to covering Q3 results and recent business trends. After that, we will be available to take your questions.","So let's turn to slide number two, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure and my honor to be speaking to you as the CEO of The Kraft Heinz Company. Since this is our first call since the merger, I thought it would be good to start by sharing with you some highlights of our first 120 days as a combined company.","After completing the merger on July 2, we moved quickly to establish our new leadership team and put in place a streamlined structure for our businesses in the U.S. and Canada Zones. Having done that early on, our integration work has remained right on track working on people, systems and process.","We have been pleased with our ability to retain top talent, particularly front-of-house marketers in key Kraft categories. We have been impressed with how the legacy Kraft team has embraced change and this performance-driven culture.","We are instituting new rituals and routines that represent the discipline, accountability and methodology for how we will operate as one of the world's premiere companies. This includes cascading core business practices that will continue to build our competitive advantage, like Zero Based Budgeting, revenue management and Management by Objectives.","We are currently rolling out our Zero Based Budgeting or ZBB across the legacy Kraft commercial units and functions and it will be the basis for our 2016 planning process, worldwide. In revenue management, we are building an internal function from the ground up to support how we go to market across roughly 40 categories in North America. We are also now installing our third core business practice that we call Management by Objectives or MBOs with all legacy Kraft leaders as part of our integration efforts.","MBO is an important language that clearly outlines measurable expectations, goals and deliverables for all our Kraft Heinz leaders. It connects our employees around the world through our goals that cascade down directly from me to my leadership team and then throughout the organization.","On our merger announcement call in March, I mentioned that we had implemented our MBO process with individual performance targets for over 3,000 people of white collar employees at Heinz. As we finalize our plans for 2016, approximately 5,200 of our employees will have specific, individualized MBOs in place.","Collectively, Zero Based Budgeting, revenue management, and Management by Objectives are systematic tools that we use to run our daily operations.","Another important accomplishment during our first 120 days was the completion of an extensive review of our combined, North American supply chain and manufacturing footprint, capabilities and capacity utilization. The actions under the resulting plan will take us up two years to be complete, but will make us more globally competitive and accelerate our future growth. We will talk about that more in details in a moment.","We're also pleased with the fact that we've been able to maintain base business momentum as we institute significant change throughout the organization. Obviously, our reported numbers have been significantly impacted by currency headwinds all year.","Excluding currency, both our top line and our bottom line drivers have been consistent year-to-date throughout the third quarter. Our top line results have been mixed. On the positive side, we have had much success with the Big Bets and innovations such as Lunchables, P3 and Heinz yellow mustard. Investments we have made in ketchup and pasta sauce are driving solid consumption gains in the markets where we compete. Our sauces business in Asia Pacific is doing well and we're benefiting greatly in Europe from an improved product mix and higher investment in marketing behind our brands.","At the same time, our challenges have continued in certain categories like ready-to-drink beverage and dinners in United States and frozen meals in a number of world markets that has held back our growth. So more work needs to be done.","On the pricing front, we have had net pricing gains in all geographies and our pricing net of commodities helped drive profit growth in both the quarter and the year-to-date.","And last, but not least, the productivity and restructuring initiatives that both Kraft and Heinz put in place prior to the merger have been driving our bottom line all year. We also started to see the beginning of some integration savings in Q3. That's our 120 day update.","Before I hand it over to George and Paulo to get more into the details of our third quarter results, I think it's important to talk about where are we going. If you are tuning into our call today, I think you certainly know who Kraft Heinz is. From our diverse portfolio of sauces, cheese, meals, meats and beverage to our extensive, global footprint with dedicated Kraft Heinz employees in over 45 countries and, most importantly, our loved brands, eight $1 billion-plus brands, five brands between $500 million and $1 billion in sales, and many, many $100 million-plus brands spread across a broad range of categories and geographies.","But that doesn't really tell you what Kraft Heinz is all about. Where are we going and how we intend to get there? It all begins with our vision, to be the best food company, growing a better world. It's an ambitious statement that guides our long-term objectives. It serves as the foundation for building our business.","Our vision speaks to our focus on transforming the industry on becoming the most profitable food company that's powered by the industry's top talent, igniting top line growth. It means that our products are the best quality, that we have the leading brands in all the categories in which we compete, that we can serve our customers and consumers to their highest expectations.","The second part of our vision underscore our focus on growth. Make no mistake, we are committed to growing our great brands by accelerating Big Bet innovations, investing more in working media and building aggressive sales teams.","But, we are also committed to being a good corporate citizen and focus on the sustainable health of our business, from our supply chain and package to our philanthropic and community investments.","Globally, we have a singular commitment to fighting hunger through our signature effort, The Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign, which provides and distributes vitamin and mineral powders to children in poor countries. Our vision outlines a path for future achievements and powers our plans for continued profitable growth.","So, how will we get there? How will we create value? Our strategy is based on three objectives; profitable sales growth, best-in-class margins, and a superior return of capital as an investment grade company. Let me speak to each, starting with profitable sales growth.","We are a sales organization and, as we have said before, we believe there are multiple avenues for sales growth ahead of us by focusing on four pillars: first, innovation, fewer, bigger, and bolder, that's what we call the Big Bets innovation; second, by having high investment in working media dollars; third, to leverage the scale of our go-to-market capabilities by building aggressive sales team; and finally, by taking Kraft brands global over time.","Through those four pillars, we will invest intelligently in our business to support innovation that responds to customer needs, marketing that supports the health of our brands, and product launch in the new markets to expand our global presence.","We also will drive profitable growth through revenue management, which is all about optimizing price pack architecture and promotion strategy and improving the ROI on trade execution. Across all these efforts, we will rigorously measure the return on our investments and deploy capital in a disciplined manner.","Our second objective is to achieve and maintain best-in-class margins. Two of the main drivers here will be Zero Based Budgeting and making our manufacturing and distribution footprint more efficient. And we have already made significant progress in each of those areas. Zero Based Budgeting, or ZBB, is a systematic approach, not a one-time event. It's all about ownership and doing more with less. It drives accountability and encourages our employees to treat company dollars as if they are their own.","And as far as our manufacturing and distribution footprint, as I mentioned, after an extensive review of our combined capabilities, yesterday we announced the difficult decision to close seven manufacturing facilities and several distribution centers in North America.","In doing so, we will eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies for the new combined company. We will also invest heavily in modernizing many of our facilities with the installation of state-of-the-art production lines, and this will facilitate further product quality improvements and innovation.","Our third objective is a superior return of capital as an investment grade company. This includes our commitment to maintain the existing dividend policy and Paulo will speak to the actions we are taking on that front a bit later.","Now, the path to creating more value at Kraft Heinz begins with executing a fast, seamless integration in our biggest commercial business, the United States. So it's my pleasure to ask my partner George to provide some on-the-ground color on how we're doing this, while still serving our consumers and our customers.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. To build on Bernardo's comments, what we've been most encouraged by and, in fact, most impressed with to date, is the speed at which our people have integrated our commercial organization.","Let me give you some statistics on what our team has been able to achieve since the merger closed. By day one, we had the leadership team of the U.S. business appointed. By day 12, we had the top 67 leaders in place. On August 14, 5 weeks from closing, we stood up the commercial organization with all our sales, marketing, R&D, innovation and commercial teams in place. And by the end of September, we had business processes in place.","Along the way, we've made a good number of promotions from within. Our new rituals and routines are already operational in areas such as sales and within our Monthly Performance Reviews in our U.S. commercial units. We've taken a best-of-both approach, with ongoing improvements as we harmonize trading terms and develop joint business plans with our retail customers. And, importantly, we are well positioned as we look forward to 2016.","Our innovation pipeline is ready to be launched and we'll talk more about that in the coming months. And we expect to continue the progress we've been making in shifting our advertising spend from non-working to working media. Now, this may all sounds good and we do feel good about where we are at. But I also understand that the numbers show several challenges.","During the third quarter in the U.S., while we didn't see anything fall off through the integration, our base business trends remained mixed. Overall, our market share in the United States has been stable with some increases and declines despite the changes we went through. And across our top 20 or so categories, our share is up or flat in roughly two-thirds of those categories.","From a consumption perspective, the bars on the right of the slide show that our U.S. retail business grew in both Q3 and year-to-date. But what I am most encouraged by is the fact that our base or non-promoted sales are up strongly. The investments we've made in Heinz ketchup, Classico pasta sauce, Oscar Mayer Selects Natural cold cuts, Philadelphia cream cheese, coffee and Bagel Bites are driving our solid consumption gains.","On the innovation front, we're seeing some encouraging momentum. Earlier this year, we made a Big Bet around Heinz Yellow Mustard. The result was a significant disruption to the mustard category in both the United States and Canada. We were able to achieve high single-digit market share in just four months, an unprecedented short amount of time. Lunchables Uploaded and our P3 portable snack innovations are also growing strongly into their second years on the market.","But in large part, this has been offset by lower volumes from ongoing challenges we've had in our Capri Sun ready-to-drink beverages, boxed dinners including mac & cheese and our Smart Ones frozen meals. These are turnaround opportunities for us and I look forward to updating you in the coming months on our plans.","From a profitability perspective, I would note two things. One is that our ability to maintain pricing consistent with our costs has held up in what has been a high pressure, deflationary environment in some of our key categories. And we feel very good about that.","Two is that the cost savings and productivity programs that were in place in the U.S. prior to the merger were all executed and delivered as planned. So overall, a good start for our team in the United States and we know where our opportunities to improve reside.","But let me turn it over to Paulo to walk through the numbers in more detail.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, George.","Before I get into our third Q results and the numbers, I'd like to spend some time on slide six, discussing our non-GAAP financial metrics. These three measures are what we use to evaluate our performance versus our internal plans, and what we will report out to you on a quarterly basis.","The first one is organic net sales growth and, similar to most companies, we simply exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures.","The second is adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA figures exclude the impact of: integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, stock-based comp, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains or losses on the sale of businesses, and nonmonetary currency devaluations, such as in Venezuela, which we recognized in the second Q this year.","The third measure is adjusted earnings per share. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, for adjusted EPS, we exclude the impact of: integration and restructuring costs, merger-related costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, impairments, gains and losses on the sale of business, and nonmonetary currency devaluations. So we adjust EPS in much the same way we adjust EBITDA, except that we do not back out the impact of stock-based compensation for adjusted EPS.","Now, a number of you have asked us about, and may be surprised by, the fact that we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting from our adjusted EPS figures. The reason we are not backing out the impact of purchase accounting is that the incremental, non-cash step-up in costs due to purchase accounting will largely be offset by incremental, non-cash favorability flowing through our income statement going forward. Beginning in Q4, we expect to see a stepped-up benefit from the amortization of prior service credits under our postretirement benefit plans due to plan changes.","To give you some numbers, the amortization of prior service credits amounted to $28 million in Q3, driven by one month of amortization related to these plan changes. Q4 this year, and every quarter thereafter for the next several years, will reflect three months of amortization at the same rate, or roughly $325 million annually.","So with that out of the way, let's turn to our Q3 results, starting with total company results on slide seven.","As you might have seen in this afternoon's earnings release, our GAAP, or reported, third quarter results are a bit disjoint due to a number of factors, including the fact that there were five calendar days of pre-merger Heinz results, while during the rest of the quarter we operated as a combined Kraft Heinz business.","So to keep things simple, my comments today will focus on our pro forma, non-GAAP results. On that basis, for the total company in Q3, we saw mixed top line results, down 9% due to a 7 percentage point currency headwind, while positive net pricing was offset by lower volume\/mix.","In terms of pricing, a 70 basis point net pricing increase reflected two factors. One, net pricing gains in all geographies, including pricing to address higher local input costs in Europe and developing markets that more than offset a negative impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to lower net commodity costs across our Big 4 commodities: dairy, meats, coffee, and nuts, in the U.S. and Canada.","Volume\/mix declined 2.7% as solid growth in Rest of World segment was offset by lower volumes in ready-to-drink beverage, foodservice, cheese and boxed dinners in the United States and Canada.","Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were both down due to an 8.2 percentage point currency headwind at the EBITDA level. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 4.8% and adjusted EPS would have been up in the mid single-digit range as well. This reflected ongoing savings from pre-merger restructuring and productivity initiatives at both Kraft and Heinz, and the beginning of integration savings; two, favorable pricing net of commodity costs; and as well as solid volume\/mix gains in Europe and Asia Pacific. Adjusted EPS also faced an additional headwind in the form of a higher effective tax rate.","The effective tax rate was roughly 30% in Q3 2015 versus roughly 25% in Q3 last year, when we had favorability from some discrete tax items on the Kraft side.","As we move forward, we would expect to see integration-related savings taking on a bigger role and, as I mentioned earlier, we should begin to see the benefit of stepped-up amortization of prior service credits under our postretirement benefit plans coming through beginning in Q4.","That's the total company. Now let me provide some color on the results and state of business in our four reporting segments: the United States, Canada, Europe and Rest of World.","In the U.S., we've been focused these past few months on executing a smooth business integration while minimizing disruption, as George talked about. You can see on slide eight that, in Q3, organic net sales declined 3.7% as gains from pricing were more than offset by a decline in volume\/mix versus the prior-year period.","On the pricing front, while net pricing in the U.S. was up only 20 basis points, this included a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points related to lower commodity costs in our Big 4 commodities, primarily dairy and coffee.","The volume\/mix declines were primarily driven by lower volume in three areas: ready-to-drink beverages, where we've reformulated Capri Sun in an effort to reverse consumption declines, but had to raise prices by about 25% to offset the higher costs of enhanced product quality; boxed dinners, where both consumer takeaway and our level of promotional activity were lower than the prior year; and foodservice, where our shipments were lower from some lost bids at a couple of key customers.","Unfortunately, these factors offset some significant gains from product innovation in Lunchables, P3, coffee and cream cheese, as well as some trend-bending in growth and market share that we're seeing from investments we've made in ketchup, mustard and pasta sauce.","Pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. grew 1.4%, driven by a combination of favorable pricing net of costs, lower manufacturing costs and lower overheads. And these gains more than offset the impacts of unfavorable volume\/mix as well as higher marketing expenses and significantly higher bonus accruals versus Q3 last year.","On slide 9:, in Canada, our focus on executing a smooth integration has been much the same as the U.S., only that our team north-of-the-border has also been dealing with the pressure of higher local input costs in many of their categories.","Organic net sales declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven by a 5.2 percentage point decline in volume\/mix that was partially offset by a 2.6 percentage point increase from net pricing. Positive net pricing reflected price increases to offset higher local input costs, particularly in coffee. But I would point out that total net pricing also included a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point related to lower commodity costs in our Big 4 commodities, mainly dairy.","The volume\/mix declines were driven by lower shipments in foodservice as well as the volume pressure caused by price increases in coffee. And these factors more than offset solid growth in pasta sauces and mustard.","Canada's adjusted EBITDA in constant currency was down 2.4%, as unfavorable volume\/mix and negative pricing net of higher local input costs, more than offset gains from pre-merger restructuring and productivity efforts as well as the start of integration savings. But pricing net of higher local input costs and the volume\/mix decline held back Q3 profit growth in the quarter.","Turning to Europe on slide 10, in Europe, our team has been focused on two fronts: executing line extensions and premiumization to drive better volume and mix performance; and driving increased efficiencies throughout our business, everything from package size harmonization to right-sizing our footprint. And efforts on both these fronts have really been paying off.","Organic net sales grew 0.5 point, driven by a combination of higher net pricing and positive volume\/mix. Gains in net pricing reflected a reduction in inefficient promotional spending in our UK beans business and strategic pricing in ketchup across a number of markets. That was partially offset by higher promotional spending to reinvigorate consumption in mayonnaise.","Positive volume\/mix was driven by ketchup and pasta sauce growth across Europe that more than offset volume declines in infant nutrition in Italy and soup in UK.","This healthy top line growth was supported by a double digit increase in marketing investments to support our brands. In the end, improved product mix, along with manufacturing and overhead cost savings, combined to deliver constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth of over 20%.","Finally is Rest of World, on slide 11, which includes our operations in three regions: Asia Pacific, Latin America and Russia, India, Middle East, and Africa, or what we call RIMEA.","Here, we are focused on profitable top line growth and adapting to local consumer trends and dynamic marketplaces in fast growing emerging markets. In the near term, however, foreign exchange trends have been, and will likely continue to be, a challenge as we pass through pricing to offset higher local input costs.","In the third quarter, organic net sales grew 7%, driven by a 4% volume\/mix gain, as well as roughly 3 points of net pricing. Net pricing growth was primarily driven by price increases to offset higher local costs in our RIMEA region.","Volume\/mix growth was driven by strength in ABC sauces in Asia, beverages in Indonesia related to Ramadan, frozen potato gains in Mexico, and solid ketchup growth in most regions. These gains were partially offset by volume\/mix declines in our Complan nutritional beverages business in India as well as Quero pasta sauces in Brazil, where we've been experiencing some recent supply chain disruption.","Rest of World adjusted EBITDA declined 29% versus the prior year due to a 43.7 percentage point negative impact from currency and approximately 25 percentage points of currency impact was due to the Venezuelan devaluation that we recognized in Q2 that we are seeing the effects of beginning in this third quarter. On a constant currency basis, our Rest of World adjusted EBITDA was up 14.3%, driven primarily by gains from cost savings initiatives.","Before I hand it back to Bernardo to close out, I wanted to provide you with an update on synergies and our capital structure. I'll start with synergies on slide 12. Overall, we remain on track. The best way to frame how we think about our opportunity here is to think about our savings coming from three areas: organizational structure, overhead savings, and manufacturing footprint.","Org structure savings tend to come earlier than other areas and are really an enabler to getting after the broader cost savings opportunity. Overhead savings are non-people-related and really driven by our ZBB system. The third piece, manufacturing footprint, tends to take the longest, as there is literally a lot of heavy lifting involved.","To-date, we have announced two major cost savings actions. In August, we made the difficult, but necessary, decision to develop a new, streamlined structure for our businesses in the U.S. and Canada Zones. This resulted in the reduction of 2,500 salaried and contractor positions across the U.S. and Canada and will represent the bulk of our org structure savings.","And yesterday, as Bernardo talked about, we announced the consolidation of our manufacturing across the Kraft Heinz North American supply chain network. This critical step in our integration plan will take up to two years to complete. It will eliminate excess capacity and reduce operational redundancies, making us more competitive and improving our ability to drive profitable growth for many years to come.","On the numbers side, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our initial financial expectations for the merger. This includes our aggressive cost savings target of $1.5 billion, which we now expect to deliver fully in 2017. And, as we've validated and updated our plans, the cash cost to achieve those savings is consistent with our initial expectations, consisting of approximately $1.1 billion of upfront cash costs and roughly $1.1 billion of CapEx for footprint optimization over the next few years.","Turning to slide 13, I am also pleased to share with you today that Kraft Heinz Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.575 per common share. That's a 4.5% increase versus the prior $0.55 per share and consistent with Kraft's historical practice and the commitment we made at the time of the merger announcement to grow our dividend-per-share over time.","We are excited to offer this increase so soon after the merger and we'll continue to remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value. Importantly, we remain confident that we'll be able to maintain our policy over time, while at the same time remaining an investment-grade company and delivering against our goal to reduce leverage to less than 3 times adjusted EBITDA over the medium term.","I'll now turn it back to Bernardo to wrap up our discussion.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paulo and George.","This is an exciting and challenging time for The Kraft Heinz Company. We have established our new leadership team throughout our organization to drive the next stage of the company's growth. We are firmly focused on finishing strong in 2015 and powering ahead towards 2016.","Our integration efforts are going well and we have laid our plans throughout 2017. We are working hard to empower our teams and to increase the speed of the decision-making process. It is core to creating our culture of ownership, an environment where checks and balances happen routinely, and meritocracy can flourish as our backbone.","For 2016, we're pushing a big agenda around innovation and sales and our efficiency savings will create an even bigger opportunity to invest in our people, our brands, and our products.","Thank you for joining us today. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening, everybody. Two questions if I could. First, George, you mentioned how oil pricing is holding up in some key U.S. categories despite high pressure deflation as you called it. Can you expand on this a bit more and maybe compare it to the last time you faced this sort of deflation?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Andrew. And, yes, we feel good about our pricing this time and the way our brands are behaving. As you know, last time we spoke about this, we were building our brand equity particularly in the refrigerated area and where we are now is very different from where we were and the brand equity has gotten a lot stronger and enabled us to do so. So not only are we seeing our ability to hold prices but even gaining market share in three out of the four cheese categories and in the cold cuts business in meat.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, second, Bernardo, you may have mentioned previously that you don't expect the extent of SKU rationalization at the Kraft portfolio compared to what you have done on the Heinz portfolio over the past two years or so. And maybe that's one of the reasons why sales at Kraft are not likely, as expected, to be as negatively impacted as we saw at Heinz. Is that still the case based on what you've seen or you've lived with these businesses for a little bit? Does that thought process still hold? Or is there more to do with Kraft than maybe you have thought initially? Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you Andrew. You're correct. As we get to know more, and now I can say, we have a very good understanding of the business and are already operating as Kraft Heinz. I think your assessment is right. We have a name to grow, and that's a big pillar of the company. But to be on, what you call, the profitable growth, to have profitable sales and in this case, we're going to have some SKU rationalization and we are going through the process as we work the revenue management business initiatives that I have said before. But you are right to say that's not in the magnitude that's what happened in the legacy Heinz over two years ago.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good evening everyone. I just had two questions. The first, could you talk a little bit about interest expense? I think in the quarter the GAAP interest expense is a lot higher than I think most of us were modeling. So I don't know if there's some one-time items in there. And maybe some clarity now that you've got at least the interim financing, how we should be thinking about interest expense going forward and then I have a follow up.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Bryan. This is Paulo. That's right. In the GAAP finance, the number that you see interest expense, there are some one-offs. They are related to the merger. So I think the easy way to think about our interest expense is that we have currently around $25 billion of gross debt, and our average interest rate is around the low 4%. So there's the simple way to do that. So when we file our Q you're going to have all the details about our debt and the cost for each of the tranche that we have.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, on slide 12, there was on the last bullet, you talk about the cost savings target of $1.5 billion by 2017. And then, $1.9 billion of it is pre-tax. So I just wanted to make sure that we're talking about \u2013 those two numbers match, meaning above the pre-tax income line, it's $1.9 billion savings. And then, the net effect is $1.5 billion at net income. Is that the way to think about it?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. So if you think about all the integration costs, the integration piece of the process here, we are very comfortable with the initial financial expectations we have. So pretty much think about this $1.5 billion as the operational savings, net of inflation. So it would appear in EBITDA of 2017. So that's the way that we think. Another thing is that this is the $1.5 billion synergy savings that we see.","In terms of the costs to achieve that, we're seeing that again is already \u2013 it is also in line with what we expected before that there are around $2.2 billion of cash cost to achieve. In this cash cost, we have everything. We have the CapEx for footprint that is half of this and we have other upfront expenses that we have, to have all the restructuring programs that we are running in the company today.","When you think about the overall integration process and the integration financial expectations that we had initially in the merger call, we are pretty much in line with both of that in terms of having the same view about the $1.5 billion synergies. And we have also the EPS accretion that we are expecting for 2017. So both the financial expectations we had initially, we are still comfortable with them.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. I have another question on productivity. Paulo, I think you said $1.5 billion to be delivered fully in 2017. At the same time, you said you got a fair amount of manufacturing work that will take around two years to complete, suggesting it won't be complete until late 2017. So, first, did I hear that right? And if so, are you suggesting once you complete the manufacturing work, there's going to be incremental savings over and above the $1.5 billion?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Hi, Jason. Now when we think about the $1.5 billion, so first, you're right. We are believing that we are seeing that we are going to deliver the $1.5 billion synergies in 2017. So it's your first question. And we really believe that the majority \u2013 this is the bulk of saves [sic] savings (46:27) that we're seeing for this program that we are running now. We should have some carryover for the following year, yes, but I think the bulk of the savings is now going to be $1.5 billion in 2017.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And that's sort of hard cost, love to comment on some softer costs. You mentioned your ability to pull out ineffective promotional spend in the UK. I think it was referencing Heinz beans. As you look at the rather large tray budget in promotional spend for Kraft, have you identified opportunity to do something similar? And if so, what do you think the magnitude may be?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Jason, this is George here. I will take this question. For the next couple of years we are focusing on revenue management rather than just trade promotion, which will include price-pack architecture and looking at return on investment in promotion. Then we will make a decision what we do with that savings, whether to invest it in better-returning promotion and grow the top line and bottom line, or drop it to the bottom line. Once we complete that analysis, we'll be in a better position to share that with you.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Look forward to hearing more. I'll pass it on.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - J.P. Morgan","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. You said a couple of times that some of the activities you're taking will take two years to complete. It seemed to be an emphasis. So two questions on that. One is the implication or is the message that we should be modeling most of that $1.5 billion in savings a little bit later than earlier? That's question one. And then question two is and maybe I'm reading way too much into this, but is the other implication there that you're unlikely to make a large, complex acquisition until that process is done. I'm just curious why you were sort of emphasizing that and whether there's anything really to read into either of those?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. When you think about the ramp-up of the savings, Ken, there will be some ramp-up of the savings. Again, when you think about the savings, it is always thinking three buckets, right? We have the organization savings; we have the ZBB savings; we have the footprint savings. So the first two, they come first. The footprint is the one that takes longer. So if you think about the view that we have today for how this savings is going to flow through our P&L, we are seeing this, the $1.5 billion full in 2017. So this is for your first question.","Of course, they will ramp up as they do start to happen, the footprint piece, according to (49:20) in 2016 and the beginning of 2017.","When you go to our second question related to our M&A ability and activities during this period of time, for sure, we have our plate full during the period of this complex integration. We don't use to comment about M&A strategy or hypotheticals in this case. But, for sure, we will be evaluating any type of opportunity that appears for the company that makes sense for the value and do create value for the company.","Kenneth B. Goldman - J.P. Morgan","Very helpful. Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good evening. I just had two questions as well if I could. I want to ask first if I could just \u2013 as you implement a program like ZBB, and we're learning more and more about that through Heinz and through other companies of running the program as well. Given that Kraft had had an already low overhead level, is there more or less opportunity that you see at Kraft for implementing ZBB, more or less say in relation to where Heinz is today? Do you see much improvement in Kraft's overhead level from ZBB?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chris. It's Bernardo. The way we like to think ZBB, to be honest, is much less as a one-time event and much more as a systematic approach of doing business. It's really fighting for the penny in the terms of capturing all the opportunities that allows us to be in a position that you can reinvest more behind working dollars, behind our people, behind our products, behind our brands and so on. So it's not only a program, but it is really a business tool that we apply in different ways.","And in that sense, you're right to say that the level Kraft already had achieved was positive within the industry. But we are finding significant opportunities, like Paulo described already embedded in the $1.5 billion. And we're also learning things from the legacy Kraft side that you're applying on the Heinz side. Just to give you an example, Kraft used to have a bag of media buy structure and costs that hurt Heinz and then they elaborated the other way around in that sense. So it's a two way, if you want to think about this. But it is true there are significant opportunities. And as we materialize then allowed us to be in a position to invest for growth. And that's idea that myself, George and the entire team here will be pushing this agenda.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Good color. And maybe a quick question for George in relation to the U.S. to see your sales down, call it, 4% for the quarter. In relation to consumption that was much better than that, as you showed, and our data certainly shows as well. Are there unique factors weighing on reported sales this quarter that we're not picking up in the measured channel data?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Chris. You probably touched on it yourself. Two things that differentiate shipment from consumption. Number one, there are changes between quarter relate on where the promotions fall and when we ship the product to the customers' DC. And that will adjust itself over time. That's not a big thing. Then you have channels that are not tracked by scanned sales, most importantly the foodservice channels.","So in the foodservice channel, we have two things going on. Number one we have a large number of contracts, particularly in the large commodity segments that are based on what we call mark-to-market. And in a deflationary market of dairy and meat, you just change the price automatically, and in a deflationary market you see a pressure on the top line. And two, both legacy companies in the foodservice business lost a couple of large accounts prior to the merger, and we are nearing the tail of that. And we see the overlap to a better comp coming in future quarters.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I had two questions. First, could you talk a bit more about the broader promotional environment in the U.S.? We've seen a fairly widespread decline in merchandising depth and I guess retail merchandising opportunities across the industry this year. And given that retailers are demanding more contributions from the industry, many of your competitors have become more gross margin focused as well. Is this setting up as an environment where it's, in a way, easier for you to realize the kinds of trade spend optimization efficiencies that you're going to be targeting over the next year?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Matthew, about the question. Let me separate it into two. One is we talked a lot in the past about the return on promotions. And that return on promotions in general in the industry comes under pressure. But two, we are seeing the merchandising levels widely in the retail coming down. But that's not what we are focusing on. We're more focusing on return on investment by categories and mainly price-pack architectures and pricing, both on an everyday and on an ad hoc by category what we want to achieve. So we believe, in the future, we will see better implementation of promotional activities based on better return on investment. And that's what we are putting our resources in and where we're making our investment.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you, George. That's helpful.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley","And just second question for Bernardo, I suppose. In the past, you've talked about a willingness to take a look at the entire portfolio and assess whether given brands and categories offer you the potential for profitable growth. And today, you talked about a few categories, like frozen and ready-to-drink beverages, that have been consistent headwinds. I know you consider these turnaround opportunities. And for now, you're investing, but is there still a willingness there to assess the relevance of those products in the portfolio over the next year or two?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Matt. Thanks for the question. Look, we're always evaluating our portfolio on a broader basis. You're right to say that in the past, we looked different in some segments against others and we're going to do the same. I think right now, our focus really is really consolidating integration. It's a lot of work that's coming through, and we are very pleased with the steps that are happening now within the company already working as Kraft Heinz, and so we're unified in operations, in sales, in our go-to-market. We're going through a huge system integration and a lot of different efforts. What does it mean in the future? We can always evaluate the portfolio with pros and cons and take significant steps, but I don't think that now is the appropriate time to do that and the time will come for us to have a better knowledge and to have a better understanding to take the right steps.","That being said, we know very well, like George already pointed out, and Paulo also mentioned, the segment, the innovation in the places we're going to be betting more of our money that we can push for an agenda of growth.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thank you, again, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. To assess your performance so far obviously, I think, for us, it's easier to look at the hindsight on Kraft, Kraft, you've just started there. And if I look at international piece, which obviously mostly is just Heinz, I'm very impressed with your 160 bps (58:05) of margin expansion in Europe and more than 500 in the first half. So, I guess, that gives us an idea of what to expect in the other places. But there's three questions here. One, it would be great if you could tell us what was your margin expansion in Europe in 2014? Last night in the 8-K, you only gave us the first half of 2015. That will be very useful again, to understand the visibility of what you're actually doing.","The second question would be that type of margin expansion in Europe, it's even more impressive when you think that that was already your highest margin division and it's a very tough retail environment there and also a tougher regulatory environment from the cost-cutting perspective compared to the U.S? So if you can comment on that.","And then three, just give us more color in terms of what you found and what allowed you to pull that type of margin expansion in Europe. All of my questions are about Europe because I assume that that's the best proof of what you are doing, what you've done at Heinz and, I guess, we can think of what you would do in North America. Thanks.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question. Addressing Europe from the business side before passing to Paolo here, who can get into more details on the margin expansion and so on, I think you are right to say that's a cycle that's playing out in Europe and we actually pretend to expand in that sense, but if you see what's happening in Europe that's innovation, an aggressive go-to-market, and higher working dollars investment that are pushing the growth.","But we went through also restructuring on the portfolio and on the sales in the last couple of years to get us the base and the results to allow us to invest big on the segments and products and ideas that we really thought could be winning the marketplace. And what's happening right now, if you see, is really the working dollars increasing in Europe. That will continue and you're going to see more investment in Europe. So, in a sense, it's coming to a point that now we're investing more and you're going to see our non-extension (1:00:30) of margin in that sense but more sales coming through more investment in a retail environment that you are right also to say that is extremely challenging.","But in order to be in that position, first of all, we need to have the Big Bets ideas on innovation. But I think our pipeline, not only in Europe but also in United States, Canada and other places are quite robust, what make me optimistic when I see 2017, 2018 and beyond. And we need to be in a position of efficiency that you say, hey, that is a right plateau you need to have so you can come and invest big to win not only on the sales piece, but expanding segments and product line within the environment we are facing in Europe. So commercially, you can expect more investment in marketing and selling in Europe as we continue to expand our product line in the region.","Paulo, do you want to comment on the margin?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, yeah. If think about Europe, if I understood correctly, Europe business in 2014, nine months would be around 30ish% in terms of margin. But I think that Chris and Rishi can help you to go through the details based on our filings later.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. I mean, I don't want to cease on the point. I mean, you gave us a number last night, it's 30.2% in Europe. I'm just asking what was not given. What was your margin expansion in Europe in 2014? Is that something you have over the top of your head, or was it really just flat margins in 2014 in Europe?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Pablo, we'll come back to you on it, because you really have to look at the historical Heinz filings, right?","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. All right.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","So we'll come back to you on it.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Can I ask one very last one? In terms of coffee K-Cups, you talked about you're looking at your portfolio and, of course, you cannot comment on what you may or may not do in the future. But specifically, in the case of K-Cups, the agreement (1:02:27) the ideas is that they're willing to be co-packing for you. You're willing to move your lines to that company, but you haven't moved those lines. So is there a plan for you to continue to start manufacturing K-Cups on your own?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Pablo, thank you. This is George. I'll take this question. First, you are right. I can't comment on the details of the commercial agreements between us and other organization. But what I can say, we are very happy with the coffee category. We have been growing shares steadily in the last four weeks, in the last 13 weeks, and the last 52 weeks. On all fronts, we have been able to grow share.","And the business in the K-Cups has been very, very healthy, a main driver to share and it will continue to be a main driver of growth for us in this category. But unfortunately, I can't give you the details of the agreement between us and other organization.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Understood. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And good evening, everyone. Would just like to start off with just a question about the quarter. Since it's our first time with the combined company, did you hit your internal objectives for the quarter? And just to note that consensus was out there on EPS at like $0.62, versus the $0.44 you report, EBITDA at $1.6 billion versus the $1.27 billion. I'm just wondering if the consensus just didn't have this run rate at all. But did you guys hit the numbers that you thought you would hit in this quarter?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David, this is Bernardo. I'm not going to comment on the numbers of the market, or consensus, or the projections within the Street. What I can tell you, from an integration standpoint and from a business perspective, as we already point out in the beginning during the presentation, we are very pleased with the progress of the business and very optimistic about the prospective what we can build here together. So to answer your question would be yes, we are.","That being said, there's a lot of moving pieces. Those are two very big companies that are pulling together in a very fast pace, already operating as one in the marketplace. What George, his team on the commercial side and the entire company from Paulo and entire leadership here is really putting a lot of efforts for us to be on a much faster pace as we move to 2016 and 2017. So to answer your question on our internal expectation and goals and the things we wanted to achieve for 2015, yes, we are on target.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Driscoll just about the EPS figures that you mentioned, I think it appears for me that the main difference, the large difference of the consensus and the number that we published was the fact that our EPS we consider post the preferred dividend is the EPS to common. So this is the main driver which in the out years we don't believe it's a big difference because all the Analyst Day they assume that we are going to refi the preferred.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","The EBITDA one misses too, so I don't -- there's something going on, but I want to ask a different question. So on the $1.5 billion of gross savings, do you have the intention of reinvesting any of that in the business and can you give us just some color there on, if so, what kind of magnitudes are appropriate for the business?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When we think about the investments, this $1.5 billion number that we have is now focused on our savings, and our restructuring programs that we have, net of inflation for 2017. We don't treat this, inside this number any type of reinvestment that we may decide to do. We don't treat the investments in the brand as the same bucket. So whatever is going to be \u2013 we are going to decide to do in terms of marketing or innovation need to pay itself have a return inside the investments. So we don't treat this together.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just one detail question. Do you guys know what the adjusted gross margin was? I don't think in the press release there was enough information to a portion, the various charges between the gross margin and the operating margin. But do you have the gross, adjusted gross margin handy?","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","David, I don't have the number, but it will be in the 10-Q when that comes out. So you'll have the disclosure there.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Okay.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Operator, if we could take one more question, that'll be great.","Operator","Absolutely. Our final question will come from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for taking the call. I have two quick questions. One, should we still be looking for the $2 billion in debt pay down by the middle of 2017? And then secondly, with all of the synergies accruing to 2017 EBITDA, should we think about you hitting that leverage target of getting below three times as a 2017 phenomenon? Or should we think about it as 2018? Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. So, I think about the first question, yes, as I said, I think we have pretty much the same all the initial financial expectations we had in the merger call, including the pay down of $2 billion in debt. We have these already structured in the way that we refied our debt. So we have this already structured in this way.","And in terms of the leverage that we expect to do, what we said before, and you are keeping track on that, that to expect to be below three times in the medium term. Of course the reason that we said in the medium term is, we don't expect the leverage to get to that level of levering the long term. So that's why we use the word medium term. But it didn't change our original expectations so far.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","But as we think about medium term, I'm just trying to get a better sense of, is that 2017, 2018 or 2019? Or is it sort of anywhere in between those types of years?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What I can say is it's exactly the same original expectations we have at the moment that went for ratings and we had all the discussions about the capital structure of the company in the merger moment.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer period. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chris Jakubik for any closing remarks.","Christopher M.

And for those of you who have follow-up questions, Rishi Natarajan and I will be around for the analysts and Michael Mullen will be around for anybody from the media. So, let me turn it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","I just want to thank you for the commitment in following up and looking forward to be updating you as the company progress and we continue to deliver the results. We believe will be coming in the coming quarters. Have all a good evening.","Christopher M.

My name is Latif, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update for the third quarter of 2016. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO; Paulo Bas\u00edlio, our CFO; and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with, GAAP results. And you could find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation available on our website.","Now, let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by repeating what I said in today's earnings release, that I think our third quarter results are very representative of the way we stand as a company. We had some normal timing impacts this quarter, which one hand benefit Canada sales and EBITDA and in other hand made Europe's financial results look worse than our internal assessment would indicate.","Overall, our Q3 results show that we have delivered respectable financials, but we still have significant room for improvement.","We are doing a good job in a difficult environment. We're working effectively to navigate a combination of headwinds from deflationary commodities to increased retail competition in some of our biggest markets. We are putting more in-store activity into the marketplace than in the first half. But we're remaining disciplined with our go-to-market activities, balancing price, promotion, and distribution while we innovate to drive profitable growth.","As a result, we are holding our improving market share in the majority of our categories and our key markets. Much of this is due to our Big Bet strategy and our ability to bend trends and capturing whitespace. For the amount of Heinz Serious Good Mayo in many markets to Heinz Barbecue Sauces in the United States, spicy ketchup into new markets and soy sauce expansion in China, our global sauces franchise continues to drive category growth in our share in markets around the world.","At the more local level, the introduction of Heinz Beans Creations led to more than 2 points of share gain in Australia during Q3. We are now investing behind the launch of Planters in China and Kraft's Mac & Cheese in Brazil, and you're seeing some significant trend bending from our Big Bet in the U.S. thanks to George and his team. That being said, we still have opportunity to turn around several problematic categories which George and Paulo will highlight in a minute.","In Europe in particular, I would add that while our shares are in decent shape overall and whitespace initiatives on the continent are doing well, we have been slow to get the right offering in what is our more competitive and evolving retail environment, the UK. We're getting more aggressive to jumpstart our categories in the country, and do expect their results next year.","On the cost front, we remain on track with our saving initiatives. Our integration program delivered roughly $330 million of savings in Q3, or roughly $1.3 billion on a run rate basis, and close to our goal. But we will not stop looking for additional savings. Not only is it important to secure our investment to drive top line growth, it has been the main driver of the 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA in both Q3 and year-to-date.","Our focus now is to set the table for 2017, delivering high quality operation results in end market execution in the fourth quarter, as we look to build strong momentum going into next year.","In terms of (05:28), this is an important time for us internally. We are fully immersed in our second annual planning process as a merged company. We continue to grow and learn from each other. And our people are in the process of aligning behind our clear vision by setting challenging goals for 2017. Soon, more than 6,000 Kraft Heinz employees will finalize their objectives for the year ahead, which cascade down directly from my objectives in collaboration with our board of directors. These also incorporate specifically GPI's commitment including significant cost targets, finalizing our Big Bets initiatives for the year ahead and determining the exact whitespace areas to push into.","As a company of owners, we take our commitment in our results personally and we make it a point to reward those who deliver on their goals. In just the third quarter alone, we promoted more than 550 Kraft Heinz employees. This is what it means to work in a performance-driven culture. It's an exciting time. We feel good about the opportunity to drive profitable growth and we look forward to updating our expectation for 2017 in the months ahead.","But now, let's turn to slide 3 to review the Q3 financial results that we are building upon. On the top line, we finally seem to be getting some relief from the foreign exchange headwinds we have been experiencing for the past several quarters. In Q3, currency was essentially neutral. Only a 0.5 negative versus the roughly 4% point drag we saw in the first half of the year.","On an organic basis, net sales were down 1 point as pricing turned unfavorable having been positive in the first half. Versus the prior-year, pricing was down 0.7 percentage points, largely reflecting; one, deflation in meat and coffee in the United States and coffee in Canada; two, higher promotion mainly driven by timing of expenses in Europe, as well as stepping up support behind new product launches in markets around the world.","Volume mix was down 0.3 percentage points, an improvement versus the 70 basis point decline we saw in the first half of the year. Versus the prior year, volume mix reflected the lower shipment, particularly in cold cuts and food service in the United States. This more than offset significant gains from innovation in Lunchables, in our Mac & Cheese portfolio in U.S. and continued growth of condiments and sauces globally.","Net EBITDA, we drove strong dollar growth in margin performance year-over-year from a combination of our solid cost-savings performance and, to a lesser extent than we saw in the first half, favorable pricing relative to key commodities cost in North America.","As a side note here, why our Q3 EBITDA margins were down sequentially from Q2 in the first half of the year? This was due to the normal seasonality of our business mix, particularly in North America. In fact, we are quite comfortable with our margin progression and how the year is playing out at the EBITDA line.","At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up almost 90% versus the prior period to $0.83. This reflects three factors: one, our solid EBITDA growth; two, the benefits from refinancing the preferred stock; and three, lower taxes driven by some discrete items coming into play in the current period.","Now, I will hand this over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reported segment and what are expecting going forward. George?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's turn to slide 4 and our performance in the United States.","Consistent with our goal for the year, in Q3 we again delivered stable, if not improving, top line performance during significant transformation of our business.","First and foremost, our new product initiatives are working well and having a measurable impact. Our Mac & Cheese renovation is bringing people back into the category, boosting consumption and household penetration. Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meal are addressing previously un-served segments of the market. Capri Sun Organic continues to build distribution and is doing well.","Our Heinz Sauces business had a very successful summer season, led by our new Heinz Barbecue Sauces and the second year of Heinz mustard. And in cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese continues to grow strongly and we're seeing good improvement in the nacho cheese segment.","We also expect the impact of our new product activities to build into Q4 with advertising about to go live behind the launch of VELVEETA Mini Block and our all natural Jell-O Simply Good dry package dessert.","The second factor I would highlight is Q3 shipment versus consumption bridge where we continued to see improvement. As you can see in the chart, our categories were essentially flat and our main challenge continued to be net market share losses.","Behind the numbers, I can tell you that more than 80% of our impact from share losses are due to cold cuts, roast and ground coffee and snack nuts, a significantly shorter list than we've seen in the past. And in each of these areas, we either have initiatives already in the marketplace or soon to be launched to reverse those trends.","So overall, we are feeling good about our momentum in measured channel. With regards to non-measured channel and changes in the retail inventory, there are three things at work. First, we continued to see strong growth in non-measured retail channels like club and value stores. Second, we continue to add new food service customers as we go after whitespace opportunities. However, Global Food Service in Q3 was down slightly due to the traffic decline that you've heard about from the restaurant companies, as well as some proactive trimming of less profitable contracts in our ingredients business.","And third, we had new product pipeline shipments of the VELVEETA and Jell-O innovations that I mentioned, as well as a few others that benefited Q3 shipment. The final piece of my update is our integration program, where we are well underway and, more importantly, on plan.","During Q3, we maintained 98% case fill rate, despite some service issues that continued to negatively impact cold cuts and Lunchables and held back our sales in those two parts of the business. That being said, we are improving those service issues in Q4.","More importantly, the overall integration project will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond from simplifying our network and co-locating similar types of production line to modernizing our production processes and improving product quality.","In summary, we have a full plate of opportunities to drive profitable growth in our U.S. business, and I look forward to updating you in coming quarters.","With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our comments.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide 5 and add some more detail on Q3 U.S. financials. In the third quarter, U.S. organic sales were down 1.2%. We think that pricing was down 0.7 percentage points due to roughly 1.5 point of key commodity deflation, mainly in meats and coffee. Volume mix was down 0.5 percentage point, an improvement from the 1.5% decline we saw in the first half of the year.","We delivered strong gains from innovation led by Lunchables in our Mac & Cheese renovation, as well as improved volume and mix benefits in our coffee business. But these were offset by lower shipments in cold cuts, foodservice and nuts.","In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margins, while margins were down sequentially due to normal seasonality of the U.S. business, significant year-over-year growth in margin expansion was similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. This was driven by integration program savings and, to a much lesser extent, favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs. While we've seen the benefit of pricing relative to key commodity costs for the first nine months of the year, we expect commodities favorability to fade even more in the fourth quarter.","Let's turn to slide 6, and the significant gains we saw in Canada's Q3 numbers. Currency turned neutral on the top line, and was a small benefit to EBITDA in the quarter, much better than the significant drag it was in the first half of the year.","Organically, volume mix swung to 3.4 percentage points of growth, up from negative 2 percentage points in the first half, and driving Q3 organic net sales growth of 2%. By contrast, pricing was down 1.4 percentage points, having been up 3.4 percentage points in the first half of the year, due to commodity-driven pricing actions in coffee.","Now, before we get to EBITDA, I have to note that the Q3 volume mix gains were driven by a combination of early event-related shipment versus the prior year and foodservice gains. And while the gains in foodservice have a good chance of repeating, we are likely to give back a good portion of the positive Q3 volume mix in Q4.","At the profit line, adjusted EBITDA was up 32.7% versus the year ago period in constant currency terms. This was driven by a combination of gains from cost savings initiatives, and this favorable volume mix I just described.","I would also note that consistent with what we said on our last call, there was no material impact at EBITDA from key commodities in Q3. And I will add that, we may see it turn into an unfavorable impact in Q4.","That brings us to Europe on slide 7. Overall, it's fair to say that we've been up and down in Europe over the past few quarters. Results this quarter were sequentially worse than Q2, after Q2 was sequentially better than Q1. However, we do not believe that the underlying trends are as bad as the Q3 numbers suggest.","Let me deconstruct the results to give a clear picture of underlying trend. Pricing was down 2.9 percentage points, primarily due to the timing of promotional expenses versus the prior year. Volume mix decreased 4.9 percentage points, reflecting a combination of shipment timing versus the prior year and on-going consumption weakness in several categories, primarily in UK and Netherlands. So from both a pricing and volume mix perspective, roughly half of the decline in each was due to timing that we would not expect to repeat going forward. As a result of the factors I just described, we saw constant currency EBITDA and margins down slightly, both on a sequential basis and versus the prior year.","This reflected the combination of unfavorable volume mix and pricing I just described and increased market investments that offset ongoing manufacturing savings. And, again, roughly half of the constant currency decline was due to timing that we do not expect to repeat.","So, overall, we think that the health of our European business is better than our Q3 numbers indicated, and with some changes in the works, we expect the business to be a meaningful contributor in 2017. Finally, we will look at the rest of the world on slide 8.","Here, for the first quarter in many, foreign currency was not a significant headwind. In fact, it was slightly positive as we lapped recognition off Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. In terms of organic growth, we saw some deceleration versus the second quarter. Much of it came from pricing, which increased 1.9 percentage points. While this was driven by pricing to offset higher input cost in local currency, particularly in Latin America, it also included higher promotional expanding to support new product initiatives like launching Planters in China and re-launching our soy sauces line in Indonesia.","On a sequential basis, we experienced less local input cost inflation to offset with pricing as well as a step up in support behind new product activity and we would expect each of these factors to come into play in the near term.","Volume\/mix was up 1.7 percentage points versus last year. Again, a deceleration from the first half primarily reflecting three factors; one, continued strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions; two, a decline in our ABC Soy Sauce business in Indonesia. And three, a temporary disruption in distribution within our Middle East and Africa business due to retailer consolidation in the region.","Overall, while we did see some deceleration in sales this quarter, going forward, we expect the distribution issues to be resolved and have investments in place to accelerate growth. So we don't see any reason to change our expectations for a strong growth in our rest of the world business, either in the near term or longer term.","Adjusted EBITDA, it was down 3.9% in constant currency terms as organic sales growth was not enough to offset higher input costs from local currency and our investments in new product initiatives. In a sense, we invested in Q3 ahead of growth. Going forward, while we face a strong comparison in Q4, we do expect better performance at the EBITDA line in our rest of the world business in 2017.","Now, before we go to Q&A, on slide 9, I want to cover a few more factors that may impact our financial performance over the near to medium term. We start and more as a reminder than a comment on our operating performance. From a comparison's perspective, I think it's important to note one of the six factors that will affect our Q4 results. That is we will experience comparisons to a Q4 2015 that included a 53rd week of shipment. Recall that when we reported Q4 2015 results, we mentioned that the 53rd week benefited net sales by 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA by 4.5 percentage points.","The second factor I want to highlight is our expectations around our integration program. Right now, we are keeping all of our targets the same, savings and cost to achieve. We are still targeting integration program savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation by 2017. As we've said before, savings have come in faster than we expected. And we do expect that input cost inflation outside of key commodity costs in North America is likely to be a partial offset to savings moving forward, especially as 2017 progress.","That said, as Bernardo mentioned, we are currently firming up our 2017 plans both cost and savings expectations, so we will be in a better position to provide a more robust update in the coming months. Along those lines, we are also finalizing our plans and investments behind our 2017 pipeline of Big Bets and whitespace initiatives to drive profitable growth.","Based on what we've already seen in the marketplace, we remain confident in our ability to drive improvements in our top-line trends in existing markets and invest behind whitespace expansion opportunities for Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. And we look forward to talking about these initiatives in the months ahead.","The last item I want to highlight is our progress and our expectations with regard to debt leverage. To the end of Q3, we have reduced our leverage to the 3.7 to 3.8 range. And this is down from roughly 4.5 only a year ago. So, we are making great progress on our goal to achieve below 3 times ratio over the medium term. And we expect this to continue at a strong pace as we move forward. This includes fulfilling our commitment to pay off $2 billion of debt when it matures next year.","That completes our update to the third of 2016. There were certainly a number of puts and takes in our Q3 results. But overall, the progress we've continued to make, improving our operations and performance in the marketplace, gives us confidence that the profitable growth we've delivered to-date, is sustainable and that we can build on this going forward.","Our focus from here is to finalize a strong agenda for 2017 and finish 2016 in a way that gives us good momentum heading into the next year.","Thank you. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. You said you were sticking with $1.5 billion in synergy guidance. I think the words were quote right now, is it safe to say, given that you're already at $1.3 billion and you're five quarters ahead of your target date that it's really no longer a question of whether the $1.5 billion number will be raised, but I guess rather by how much and when you might raise it?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken. This is Paulo. Again, I think what I can say for you now that we're still targeting the $1.5 billion net of inflation for next year. I can share with you that, yes, we have a good visibility on strong stream of future savings, but we are still finalizing our expectations around things like cost inflation, product and brand investment and I think that we'll be in a better position to provide a more complete update in the coming months for you.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And one more from me. You mentioned I think two or three quarters ago, that maybe you had \u2013 and correct me if this is wrong, kind of bit much out of some spending in the UK, I think if memory serves, it was related to some soup promotions and maybe you thought it was prudent to add some of those promos back. As the year has progressed, is there anyone else \u2013 or anywhere else rather you really cut into the bone and you had to add back, whether it's in terms of number of people, capabilities, promotions? I'm just trying to get a sense because you've been very aggressive and it seems all to have been so successful, are there any areas where maybe you had to tweak your initial expectations or practices perhaps?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken. It's Bernardo. Thanks for the question. Let me start by the end. I really don't think the UK performance, and I'm going to comment about that in a minute, has anything to do with the level of spend or we cut too much on the model that \u2013 I can guarantee you, we really don't see that way.","What I think is important when it's to Europe, and especially the UK that you mentioned, is to separate, because we continue to have a solid performance in Continental Europe, okay? With the exception of the Netherlands, I would say all other countries are having a positive year and with a good buildup of plans for 2017. But our performance in UK has been poor, right? The environment has been difficult, but that has been the case for a couple of years, and we really don't see that changing in the next coming months, quarters, or even years. I really believe we have been slow to react and get the right price mix and offering in the marketplace.","If you see our market share, especially on key categories like beans, sauces, and others, and also to some small degree soups, it hasn't changed that much, has been quite solid share performance. But we haven't suffered from a category decline in a channel mix change in the country.","There is a lot happening now, especially with the new soup season that starts right now as the winter approaches the country. So we're really changing a lot our balanced price, promotion, distribution in this very shaky retail environment in the UK. We had a change in leadership in the country as well.","We moved our most \u2013 one of the most talented commercial people we had from Australia, New Zealand that are even more difficult when you concentrate with the environment to the UK and Europe to lead our business there. So I'm really confident that we can have a better performance looking at 2017 and beyond. We're seeing all the seeds of the performance and that's already happening as we speak.","That being said, the mistakes we did on price mix and distribution, now a good learning for us to have a much more solid plan coming 2017.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question for you just in relation to the net cost savings that you reported of $330 million in the quarter. I just want to get a sense, does that incorporate any measurable benefit from lower input cost or lower cost in general? And then would you accept that the turn sort of be more of a drag on that figure in the fourth quarter with more in 2017 when you expect that to occur?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Paulo again. It incorporates all the savings and all the cost base we have. It does not incorporate any type of the big four commodities that we have. But all the other costs are inside these numbers.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, I just want to make sure I follow a bit on Ken's question in relation to Europe. I think you mentioned around half of the decline in organic sales was due to some unique factors.","It still suggests sales was down 4%. I think you have some easier comps coming up, but you also mentioned having some more plans in place to accelerate that growth in Europe. Is that a near-term opportunity or 2017? And I think you just mentioned how the UK remains quite weak. Are these UK-related plans or more around the Continental Europe?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi Chris, it's Bernardo. Like following up the question before, like I said, if we see our Continental performance, again, with the exception of the Netherlands, it's actually quite solid in all countries including Italy, where we have been experienced more difficulty in past years and we have been improving.","So that being said, that we're not changing our plans for Continental Europe in no means. The performance in UK that for us has been disappointed. Like I mentioned before, it's true that overall 50% has been one-offs, like Paolo said, and a fact, but we are working on the categories we have a strong presence like soups and so on. We'd come here completely different product offering in volume\/mix, promotions and so on.","And also remember that you're coming with other Big Bets looking 2017 and beyond that I think really can move the needle in the country. I think a good example of that would be Heinz Serious Good Mayo that we just had the start in the last really seven months, eight months and it's doing quite well from a market share standpoint. And we see more of that coming 2017 and beyond.","Is that going to be enough to the turnaround of margin to the country? It's for us to prove. But they're the seeds of the things we are doing there, are definitely showing much better results and give us optimism about what's happening for the coming quarters and years in the country.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You discussed that there had been some mistakes in terms of the pricing and promotional spending. Can you talk about where you are on your analytics of this process because when I think about you guys, I think that you guys are probably the most furthest along on the analytics of understanding where your promotional spending will get the greatest lift and it sounds like throughout the world, there were some issues \u2013 spotty issues. I was just kind of curious to see what analytics you're working on, where you're going with it and how far along you think you are?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Ken. This is George, and I will speak in general because one feature of our business model is that they are very similar processes we use in the United States and around the world and one of them, utilization of analytics to really manage revenue, manage cost and so forth.","Where we are now, we're very happy that we have the capability built already to look at more granular understanding of category drivers and performance. We've done that for about 30, 34 categories. So far, it has had some positive effect, but limited to few categories, one or two in each business unit. And we like the results we are seeing. It will take time though to execute all the opportunities we identified by category or by geography.","And for us, this is an area where we would like to get it done right rather than move fast because it's a very delicate area and it requires a number of things to come together within the organization and us working with external parties.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And my second question is, you talked about commodity inflation. Which commodities are you seeing inflationary, or are you talking about labor costs and healthcare costs, because it seems like there is \u2013 at least the meat cost seems very deflationary. Can you talk about that?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you. Look. I'll talk about the commodity, and I will pass to Paulo to talk a little bit about other costs and give you color about that. So, the big four commodities that have impact on our business are mainly in dairy, in meat, in coffee and in nuts. And we have seen a different direction depending on the category. So as of late, we have seen coffee has edged up a little bit, so has dairy, where meat went into the other direction.","For us, it's very hard to try to call where it's going to be in the future. We are better off at managing the actual outcome of it than actually trying to forecast it, especially the movement, whether up or down, that we are seeing has no fundamental. But we feel very good about our ability to manage it regardless which direction it went to.","As for the rest of the cost, I'll pass it on to Paulo to give you some color.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Oh, yes, George. Now, if you think about it, now there's some inflation outlook here, we are expecting some input cost inflation outside our big four commodities in 2017. I think we're going to have a better color of that in the few months ahead. But just remember that when we track and do \u2013 when we track our savings, all of these costs beside the big four are included in the number that we provide to the market.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks, everyone. I wanted to ask two category specific questions to George. First is on the meats business. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on the drivers of the weakness, and to what extent, if any, has that been driven by competitive dynamics in the category as opposed to service issues? And while you're taking these steps to fix the business, have there been any \u2013 have these fulfillment issues resulted in any sort of distribution losses that we should expect to take longer to correct?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you very much, Matt, and let me answer your question. Within the meat business, we have a number of categories, so let me break it down and give you commentary around each one of them. The service issues that we have are restricted to two categories, happen to be large categories for us. One is what we call the cold cuts, which is the sliced meat, and the other one is Lunchables.","Lunchables is driven by a very, very strong demand. We saw mid-year some double-digit growth in that business. And, while it's been growing, our ability to supply has been somehow constrained, and we are working now and getting out of it, but the business is still growing.","In cold cuts, in the sliced meat, we have had capacity issues, and this is the area where we are investing the most, and our footprint changes. We're essentially building brand-new factories, two brand-new factories, one in Davenport, one in Kirksville as an addition to the factories we have there. And we started working on getting out of the service levels, but that was severely affected with service levels. And we had some distribution losses in some of the customers and that was jointly managed and agreed between us and our trade partners and within time as our ability to supply increases, you will see us moving forward in that.","As for the hotdog category, that is a category issue. So our market share is in line with where the category and our growth rate or decline is in line with the categories, and we feel very good about our bacon business where we are doing well.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, George. And just one other question, could you talk a bit more about the approach to nutritional meals and the Smart Ones brand in particular? Just curious if you're proactively walking away from SKUs or product lines there, and whether there's any plans in place to reposition or upgrade that business?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you. And let me \u2013 what we did over the past few months, we reframed the frozen meat categories to broaden the customer base that we are serving. Historically, we only serviced a very small segment within the broader frozen meal, and that is what we called nutritional, but really it was the diet segment, the people who are on a diet and we used the Smart Ones brand to service that consumer segment.","We had a look at the category about seven months, eight months ago and we felt we would \u2013 we are in a strong position to broaden the segment we are serving. And essentially, we are servicing now three consumer segments. One is the Smart Ones segments and the diet segment for people who are managing weight losses. The second one is the Smart Made. It's a slight difference to that one by utilizing more products that are natural or venturing into the Real Food category while maintaining good calorie content. And the third one, it's purely on taste, and that is Devour. And we launched in the marketplace only a few months ago and where it has distribution, we've seen our market share at mid to high single digit, and it's doing very well and it's servicing a segment that is \u2013 that's where weight management and calories is less relevant and taste is the key criteria.","So, and we're very happy where we are so far. That segment, for us, the frozen meal, was in a severe decline and every time we venture in serving new customers, we cut that decline significantly and we feel very good about its prospect moving forward.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much, George.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer of RBC. Your line is open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good evening. You've spoken in the past and a little bit on this call about you approaching a period of shifting dollars to more effective promotion programs, and you mentioned that you did analytics. I think, you said earlier on across 34 categories. Are you still in the sell-in period to retailers for improved promotion constructs, and in other words, do you believe that promotion effect in this is going to show up more in your net revenue in 2017 and beyond than perhaps what we're seeing in the second half of this year?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, David. For your question. I will add some commentary to that. Revenue management \u2013 or if you want trade, promotion and some promotion, it is part of a broader revenue management program.","What we're focused on since we came together as one company is truly building the capabilities. We found the focus on building the capabilities has far long-term impact on what we do than having a project to get a quick wins out of it. And the second, once we build that capabilities, we started testing in a number of business units and we tested one or two categories in each business units. We like what we saw. And it is not just a promotional activity, it is a number of levels that we looked at.","And in some cases, we saw ourselves investing more rather than investing less. In some places, we took prices up; in others we refused and took prices down. But we're very happy with the capabilities we're building. The reason I say this is a long term and we want to do it right rather than doing it fast, because it has wider impact on your product mix that has impact on your supply chain. This has an impact on the competitive set. And it has an impact on the discussion with the retailers. So far, our discussions with our trade partners have been very good because it has been mutually beneficial for them and us.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just a quick follow-up on the innovation front, you've had some successes. You can see in the data, Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and the Kraft barbecue sauce, but obviously, I'm sure you'd like to have more of those Big Bet successes. Do you feel like your pipeline into 2017 versus 2016 at this time last year is more robust, more Big Bets next year than this year?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yes, I do. Simply I do feel that 2018 is much stronger than 2016 in terms of innovation \u2013 and sorry, 2017 is much stronger than 2016, and 2018 is much stronger than 2017. This is an area that despite all the transformation and integration work that we did, we never lopsided that, this is the area that is going to sustain our performance into the future.","As with every new product, you never have 100% success rate. So the way we look at it, to get an x number of dollars out of the innovation, we plan launches much higher than that allowing to success rate. And when we look at the probabilities of success for 2017 compared to 2016, we're starting with much larger pipeline. So if we apply the same probabilities of success, we would be in a stronger position.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is open.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you, and good evening.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Good evening.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Could you...","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hey, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Could you guys quantify the year-to-date benefits from PNOC? And then could you just comment upon the repeatability or sustainability of those benefits?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, David. This is Paulo. You clearly see that in our press calls that we have a big benefit from PNOC in the first half of the year. When you think about Q3 specifically, the benefit we have from PNOC is smaller. As we were communicating before, it is around $11 million we have in the North America business benefit from PNOC. So this benefit would still be as expected. I'm going to ask George to comment on that.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Paulo. Let me talk a little bit about the repeatability. This is something that it is part of how we manage revenue and at some stage, the line is going to blur between what is PNOC, what is trade efficiencies, what is revenue management, it is going to be part of all that. But so far, we have managed very well in both on the ups and downs of commodity. Our expectation is to continue doing so.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just one other question. The integration is expected to be completed by the end of the year I think. I think it's a stated comment but I do believe that you've got some manufacturing plants that are slated to be closed but will occur in 2017. So I'm a little bit confused on exactly when all the \"integration efforts\" are done. The purpose of the question is just to ask when do you have capacity such that you could start to contemplate another deal, and that you would have the capacity to actually begin an integration? Does that make sense?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Hi, David. It's Bernardo. You're right on the footprint question. We'll continue to have a couple of manufacturing changes and so on already announced and planned. So it's actually going quite well. George mentioned here the two facilities that we're building on the meat side, but we have others on the warehousing and other categories that we're expanding.","And so all this work, it goes up to 2017 as planned. So that's not changing. They are important milestones and integration that's already behind us, like the systems, and already operating, all the planning on the commercial side and analytics in the same environment. So it's really Kraft Heinz, I would say, already operate as one, and most part of the issues we have behind us.","On your question about whether there's an M&A, we never like to comment on hypothetical, and we really believe we have a solid organic path here to create value, and we are working really hard on that. That being said, we also believe our model is highly scalable, and I think the integration results of Kraft Heinz are proving it. So a lot for us to do on the day-to-day, and we want to be focused on that for now.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for the question. I wanted to come back to Bernardo, your last comment on sort of the organic growth of the asset you've assembled from a bottom line perspective and some of the other questions that have anchored around the UK.","I think some of the skeptics of your model are probably going to look at the results and look at year-to-date EBITDA and the rest of the world down 8%, Europe down 13.5%, and I know UK has got some unique situations, but still you combined those two businesses, which are probably our best approximation of legacy Heinz and EBITDA is down 11%. And I think some will look at that and say, gosh, is the risk that two years from now North America looks similar. So, I was hoping maybe you could comment on some of those, what I think will be questions from some investors, and also maybe add on top of that, some of what you've learned from those markets that you're applying in North America to ensure that the North America growth is more sustainable.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thanks, Jason, for the question. I think I understand the way you're grouping different things and so on, but I think it's important here to separate. First, on the rest of the world part, we continue to see really very solid near and long-term growth perspective to the business. As Paulo said, there were temporary issues behind this core area like distributors disruption in Middle East and Africa. We invested much more behind the growth you're already seeing for 2017. For example, the launch of Planters in China is a good example and others, so we were seeing these in a very, I would say, a solid way.","On respect of the model and again, I totally understand your comments. I think there are learnings from the UK situation that are really specific to the country. Especially, remember what happened to UK in the last two years, is that the leader of the retail environment really faced a lot of problems and disconnect to the market for quite some time for different issues. And now it's coming back in a very strong way and this retail shaking that happened in the country, I truly believe you have not been fast enough on the offerings that were coming. I cannot see any correlation to your question to the model given that everything we did, we didn't \u2013 if you see all our lines connected to the market, like marketing, selling and modern investments, they all grew up in the country in the last four years.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","So from a model standpoint, there is absolutely no correlation. That is a vital essence for us that your last question, can you learn from the UK and to be applied in other places like the U.S., and others. There I could not agree more. I think they are important lessons for us, for me, for George, for Paulo and for the entire team here. That you're going to need to prepare, especially when you have a situation like happened in the retail in UK. It's not that often that that happens for us to be ahead of the game and not reactive, given the market share and the positions we have in the country.","So I think the situation anyway, your bundle are very different. In rest of the world, I'm investing for more growth. So I'm coming for China with a different plan. I'm coming for Indonesia. I'm coming \u2013 even for markets with like space, like Australia and New Zealand. In the UK, it's a different story. My volume mix and everything I'm working behind my promo activity is to get right what is the offer in my distribution, so I can come back to profitable growth strategy.","From a model standpoint in the question that \u2013 you cut too much or cut too little. I can't have any correlation given what is that, because in that sense, my marketing is going up and my selling is going up within the country.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","The right criticism to say to us, is to say, hey, if I have money invested, as I did this year in UK, I probably would be better off (57:25).","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, I...","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","But my offering didn't come true as it should. And I don't think it's the right thing to do as well, because we're looking for UK for the next 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. So the brands we have in the country are so strong and our equity is so solid that we will never going to sacrifice the middle and long term for any short-term gains, we don't do that. So in a sense, I don't think it's a model issue, I think it is, for sure, a question of the balance of product mix and offering and so, and those learnings we should take, and apply in other markets.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I think that's fair, the question obviously needs to be asked. So thank you for the explanation, I really appreciate it. I'll pass it on.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. George, I wanted to come back to the cold cuts business in that the last time Kraft made capacity improvement to the U.S. network, it was done in cheese. And that drove some pretty material efficiencies and flexibility to invest back in the network for some nice competitive separation.","So as these meat plants are commissioned, how should we think about any sort of step change that'll create in terms of capabilities or cost to serve, innovation or otherwise?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, John. And answering this question for me is easy because I did that change in the cheese capabilities, if you remember. I ran that business six years ago. And this is when we made the step change in cheese and since then, we never looked back and you've been seeing the results of that. We're actually repeating very similar model in the meats business.","What we're trying to do, we're trying to get two things at once. One, modernize the manufacturing capability and the technology to be able to make the products of the future rather than the products of the past. And two, try to get a cost advantage compared to anyone in the marketplace and we believe we are in a strong position to do so. It's just going to take a little bit of time for us to complete that project, and once we're out of it, no different to the model we did in cheese when we modernized and reduced our costs and we became world-class, cost effective in it. The meat business would be in a similar situation.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Once you get past the meat investments, are there other categories you can call out that may have been starved for investment over the years, similar to meat and cheese?","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","It's a very good question. Yes, there are. Actually, meat, while meat has taken the lion's share of our footprint investment, there are a number of other manufacturing sites where we are making investments. As a matter of fact, about 15% of our active lines are affected between transfers, decommissioning old lines and installing new ones.","What we're also doing, we are outsourcing a number of non-core low volume SKUs across the board, and we are in-sourcing some higher volume SKUs, again across the board, not exclusive to meat. And we're also reducing the number of warehouses and distribution centers. So all together, it's a very large investment across the entire network. The meat happened to have the larger portion of it, but we're doing it across the board.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, George.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you very much.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Latif, if we can take one more question that will be great.","Operator","Yes, sir, and that question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, everyone. Can I just ask about the promotional activity again? It looks as though your proportion of sales on promotions in the U.S. are down several hundred basis points this year, and you've gone through how you've been optimizing that.","So with Walmart and other retailers asking for reinvestment back in pricing in 2017, do you anticipate that the promotional activity will really start around perhaps next year? And if so, what does that do to your margins? Thank you, and I'll pass it on there.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Alexia. I will take that. Our promotional activities and the intensity of our promotional activities keep changing depending on a number of factors. One is the competitive environment. Two is the strategic position of that category.","So when we look at our categories, we classify them as an invest category, protect category, or bet on or manageable margin. And so we do not just have one view of promotional activities and we go and implement it. So if you look deeper into our sales, if you go one layer down or two or three, you would find a very different direction. And that's why we try not to take as an overall view whether it's going up or down.","And as for the investments moving forward, we would continue exactly utilizing those same strategies. What we're finding though, it's not just the promotional activities or the sales generated from promotional activities, rather than the return that we get from promotional activity. We have become, through data analytics, lot more competent in the ability to select which promotion and which category with which account. And we're finding very, very different returns. And that, by itself, is allowing us to actually do more with that.","So, we're not going to somebody and just saying, we're cutting across the board promotional activities. We're just doing more with that.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co.","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jakubik for any closing remarks. Sir?","Christopher M. Jakubik - Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Thanks, Latif, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. For any of the analysts that have additional questions, I'll be around, as well as Andy Larkin. And for anybody in media who has additional questions, Michael Mullen will be available to take your call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Good afternoon and thanks for joining our business update for the first quarter of 2016. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO; Paulo Basilio, our CFO; and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. commercial business.","During our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation available on our website.","And with that let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you Chris, and good afternoon everyone. Here we're again. It seems like only a few weeks ago we were reviewing Q4 results. Last call, we gave our agenda for 2016, so how we're doing so far? We're off to a good start, good not great. As expected, some headwinds hung around, including consumption trends in some key categories that held us back.","On our last call, we spoke about plans to address categories such as U.K. soups, U.S. mac & cheese, ready-to-drink beverage, and frozen nutritional meals. And while we're making progress against those opportunities and expect better performance as the year unfolds, they held back our results in Q1.","At the same time, our emphasis on profitable sales growth is paying off. Our market share trends are improving behind innovation and marketing investments. For instance, investments we've made in our global ketchup franchise are leading category growth in the U.S., Canada, and Europe and driving strong growth for us in developing markets.","In Europe, outside of U.K. soup, the rest of the portfolio is improving share performance in a challenging consumer and retail environment. And we're seeing good gains from investments in the rest of the world, pasta sauce in Latin America, soy sauce in China, and soups and mayo in Australia.","We were also able to improve our sales and go-to-market execution in what remains a challenging retail environment. For instance, our Case Fill Rate in the United States was 98%; Europe was above target at more than 99%. And Canada achieved for the first time, 97%.","Why is this so important? As we implement our manufacturing footprint initiatives, we're trying to keep our focus in two areas, customer service, where we had a good performance with our customers, which is shown by increased service levels in the quarter. In fact, we are already becoming the benchmark for customer service in some key categories.","And second, product quality where I'm pleased to report progress in the quarter, but with a lot of work still to be done. Regarding the integration program, I'm also happy to report that our savings are coming faster than we were expecting, roughly $225 million in Q1. Paulo will speak more about where we stand with the overall program later.","But faster progress towards our goal to achieve best-in-class margins allowed us to invest with greater confidence as we lay the groundwork for future growth. Our Big Bet launches are starting to gain traction in the marketplace, and we have more to come. George will talk about our strong pipeline for U.S. Big Bets.","In Europe, we continue to go after the opportunity to grow condiments and sauces with the March launch of Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Germany. In Italy, we launched a Plasmon Nutrimune, which contains a proprietary functional ingredient that significantly improves babies' immune systems. And in both Europe and North America, we're beginning to go after whitespace opportunities in foodservice.","Finally, we took further steps to bring our performance-driven culture to life. As part of our MBO process, management by objectives process, first quarter performance appraisals are going well. We now have 6,000 employees worldwide, who have MBOs, up from 3,000 at this point last year.","So overall, good operating progress that we expect will lead to better execution and profitable growth going forward.","But let's turn to slide three to see what this meant for our Q1 financial results. On the top line, while we saw less foreign exchange drag than Q3 and Q4 that year, it was still a 4.5% headwind on Q1 results. That being said, we had a solid organic net sales performance, up 1.1%, driven by a good balance of volume\/mix and pricing.","Pricing was up 0.3%, reflecting gains in most segments, despite deflation in key commodities in the United States and Canada. Volume\/mix was up 0.8%, reflecting growth in, first, condiments and sauces globally with particular strength in developing markets; second, Lunchables and P3 in the U.S. And finally, foodservice expansion in the United States.","At EBITDA, we drove strong dollar growth and margin performance, both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4, despite the Venezuela devaluation impact that began in Q3, 2015. This was driven by a combination of our strong cost-savings performance, favorable pricing relative to key commodity costs over the prior year, and profitable top-line growth.","At the EPS line, adjusted EPS was up 37.7% versus the year ago period to $0.73, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted EBITDA.","Now, I'll hand over to George and Paulo to talk more about how we did in each reporting segment and what we expect going forward. George?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to slide four, overall, we are encouraged by our U.S. results so far this year, as it reflects steady commercial execution in a year of transformation. In the first quarter, we had a mix of positives and negatives we have seen before.","We have continued our momentum from investments in Heinz ketchup and mustard, Philadelphia cream cheese, Lunchables and P3, and ready-to-eat refrigerated desserts. At the same time, consumption and share challenges in ready-to-drink beverages, mac and cheese, frozen nutritional meals, and salad dressings remained. And, I will mention what we are doing about it in a moment.","We did deliver sequentially stronger organic growth in Q1, although you will note that our growth was above consumption which you would have seen in our first quarter scanner data.","This was due to three factors. First, we saw solid growth in our foodservice business and non-traditional retail channels like club and dollar stores. This is consistent with the business development or whitespace opportunities I mentioned on our last call. Much of it has been enabled by the combination of the Kraft and Heinz foodservice teams, and we should continue growing in coming quarters.","The other two factors were new product pipeline fill from our solid innovation agenda and shipment timing between quarters, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. We also saw our cost savings initiative pick up pace sequentially from Q4. This is from ZBB and procurement savings, adding momentum to the organizational structure savings we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. It positions us well as we ramp up modernization and capability-building within our manufacturing footprint, and continue to invest behind our brands and Big Bets over the rest of the year.","I hope you have seen some of our advertising already, but our Big Bets activities are beginning to gain some traction in the marketplace, with more activities to come. For example, the launch of our Kraft Mac & Cheese renovation has been well received by consumers. And we supplemented that with the launch of new premium Mac & Cheese under the Cracker Barrel brand in the same category.","We launched Capri Sun Organic and renovated our Kool-Aid Jammers product with fewer calories and no preservatives. We added a new line of premium pasta sauces under the Classico Riserva brand, made with no artificial ingredients or added sugar. We strengthened our barbecue sauces business by adding new lines under the Heinz brand, betting on consumer regional preferences in this category. And we added new lines to our salad dressing business including new packaging formats.","It's very early days. And we are not claiming victory in any category; but to the extent we can prove the trend-bending ability of our Big Bets, it's not only good for Kraft Heinz, it's good for the center of the store in general.","With that I'll turn it over to Paulo to wrap up our prepared comments.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. I will start on slide five and add a few notes on U.S. Q1 financials. Within organic growth, pricing was flat, reflecting pricing gains across most categories, despite a headwind from deflation in key commodities. Flat volume\/mix mainly reflected innovation in Lunchables and P3, the foodservice gains and shipment timing George discussed, and gains in coffee that were partially offset by lower shipments of ready-to-drink beverages where we were up against pre-price increase buying with Capri Sun last year; as well as lower consumption of bacon and frozen nutritional meals. The Easter holiday shift did not play a significant role versus last year.","In terms of adjusted EBITDA and margin expansion, this was driven by integration program savings as well as two other factors, one was favorable pricing relative to lower key commodity costs, and the fact that we were comparing against a Q1, last year, where the Kraft business saw pricing trail the impact of key commodity costs. While we've seen a similar benefit for the past couple of quarters, we expect the pricing to be more in line with key commodity costs as we move forward. The other factor, an offsetting impact, was unfavorable volume declines in ready-to-drink beverages and frozen nutritional meals.","Let's turn to slide six to talk about the key factors impacting Canada in the first quarter. In Canada, we continued to see strong currency headwinds but the negative 10% impact from currency was slightly less intense than what we saw in Q3 and Q4 last year. Organically, we delivered sequentially better sales performance with pricing gains exceeding the related decline in volume\/mix.","As we said on the last call, heading into 2016, we were facing challenges to increase prices in order to offset higher input costs in local currency terms. As a result, we saw positive pricing of 3.7% despite headwinds related to deflation in select key commodities. Volume\/mix went down 2.2% as solid growth in condiments and sauces was more than offset by a decline in cheese due to a reduction in promotional activity versus Q1 last year, as well as lower coffee and foodservice shipments.","Adjusted EBITDA was up 33.6% versus the year-ago period, despite a negative 14.2% impact from currency. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by gains from cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing relative to higher local input costs, that were partially offset by unfavorable volume\/mix.","Overall, we saw a lot of EBITDA favorability this Q1 in Canada. However, I would note that some of the Q1 upside was driven by favorable timing of pricing versus declining commodity costs. As a result, we will not expect our EBITDA margins in Canada to continue at that level in Q1, as price levels are expected to be more consistent with the key commodity costs in coming quarters.","That brings us to Europe on slide seven. In contrast to Q1 profitability in Canada, being better than we would expect for the balance of the year, we expect the balance of the year in Europe to be progressively better than what we saw in Q1. While we saw sequential improvement in Europe's organic sales performance in Q1, including an improving volume\/mix trend. It was still down, and down largely due to higher promotional spending versus the prior year.","The increase in promotional spending was due to two factors. First was a return to more normal promotional frequency in U.K. beans versus the prior year. And as a result, we saw a solid lift in U.K. beans volume. The second factor affecting pricing was a Q1 infusion of promotional spending in U.K. soups to address distribution losses from Q4's programming execution.","While this led to a solid March performance, our January and February results were much more like what we saw in Q4, made worse by the fact we were at the high of the soup season. This along with the lower shipments of infant nutrition in the U.K. and Italy led to a volume\/mix decline of 0.8%, and offset both the solid volume gains in the U.K. beans as well as ongoing growth in condiments and sauces across Europe.","Constant currency EBITDA also went down versus prior year. And margins were less, both sequentially and versus prior year. Again, this was primarily due to investments in pricing to defend U.K. soups as well as weaker category consumption in that category. We also had higher marketing costs versus prior year in Q1, driven by investments behind Big Bets, but coming ahead of growth from these initiatives that we expect later in the year.","In the end, we feel better about the health of our European business than our Q1 numbers might indicate and are continuing to invest in profitable growth as we move forward.","Finally, we will look at the rest of the world on slide eight. Here, we saw slightly less foreign currency drag in Q1 versus Q3 and Q4, but still over 25%, mainly due to recognizing the devaluation of the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar at the end of Q2, 2015.","In terms of organic growth, we saw greater organic sales growth for the second quarter in a row, driven by a good balance of volume\/mix and pricing. Pricing of 2.1% was mainly driven by pricing to higher local input costs in Latin America. Volume\/mix went up 8.3% due to strong growth in condiments and sauces in all regions, as well as strong beverage growth in Indonesia versus the prior year period. But I would note that the Indonesian beverage growth was mainly due to earlier Ramadan shipments, so we will give back part of this favorability in Q2.","At EBITDA, we saw a 12.1% decline in adjusted EBITDA due to negative 38.2% impact from currency. 29.5% of which was from the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar devaluation. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA was up strongly in Q1, driven almost exclusively by volume gains and mix improvement. That covers our Q1 results.","Before we go to Q&A, I want to quickly provide an update on two areas: our capital structure and our expectations for the balance of 2016. I will start with capital structure on slide nine. I think it's important to recognize the significant steps we've taken and plan to take to strengthen our capital structure. As you may have seen in our 10-K, we've taken steps to reduce and de-risk our pension and postretirement liabilities. We froze or ended executive retirement benefits plan where possible.","And during both last year and the first quarter, we've taken actions to improve our funded status by approximately $1.7 billion and further de-risked our plans by an additional $1.7 billion through terminations, buyouts, and lump sum offerings.","We've also been able to match our debt with our underlying business structure, and believe we've made our balance sheet and P&L well-protected against currency volatility.","Going forward, we remain confident in reducing leverage from roughly 4 times net debt to rolling 12-months adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 to less than 3 times over the medium term.","In addition to grow EBITDA, three factors will also help us to get there. One important step will be refinancing our preferred stock when it becomes redeemable in June. At current interest rates, we expect this will be a highly accretive action from both an earnings and cash flow perspective.","Second, we continue to expect to pay down $2 billion of debt by July 2017. And third, we aren't planning to commence any common stock repurchases until at least July 2017. Overall, we are making good progress in balancing a conservative financial policy, while remaining committed to a strong dividend payout.","That brings us to slide 10 and our outlook. First, we remain on track or ahead in each of the three areas of our integration program; organizational structure, ZBB, and manufacturing footprint. All our targets remain the same, savings and cost to achieve. We continue to target cost savings of $1.5 billion, net of inflation, fully realized in 2017. And we still anticipate $1.9 billion of pre-tax P&L costs, including $1.1 billion in cash.","Through Q1, we've taken roughly $1.1 billion or just over a half of the total P&L costs, including roughly $700 million or 65% of our likely cash expense. On the capital expenditures side, we continue to anticipate $1.1 billion of CapEx from the integration program. To date, integration related CapEx has been just over $300 million or roughly 30% of the CapEx spend we're anticipating. But keep in mind that integration-related CapEx is in addition to the 2.5% to 3% of net sales we expect to spend on an ongoing basis.","As far as our 2016 outlook goes, based on our results through Q1, we remain confident that we'll make meaningful progress this year towards our goal of achieving best-in-class margin. That being said, as I mentioned earlier, pricing is likely to be more in line with key commodity costs going forward.","And faster ZBB savings will give way to organizational structure savings beginning to lap around September. By contrast, we expect to see stronger EPS in the second half of the year due to expected earnings accretion from refinancing of our Preferred Stock in June. That's our current expectation from a financial perspective, but we have significant work ahead of us to realize our potential.","We have additional Big Bets to launch as the year progresses and we continue to lay the groundwork for whitespace expansion of both Kraft and Heinz brands in both foodservice and international channels. We are also ramping up our IT and supply chain footprint activities significantly. And we are highly aware that, in many ways, we've benefited so far by a lack of business disruption, and making sure that remains the case will be a key area of emphasis throughout the year. Kraft Heinz is in a good position to unleash profitable growth, but as Bernardo said on our last call, it's also a time of significant challenges for The Kraft Heinz Company.","Thank you, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, just had a question for you in relation to the synergies and the savings coming through, when you see the incremental savings, I think I heard you discuss, Paulo, some discussion about ZBB savings coming through this quarter. I just was curious as well is that the main driver of the incremental savings sequentially or are there footprint savings coming through as well; I thought of those being more back half of the year?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Chris this is Paulo. You're right and I'll \u2013 we're seeing these savings appearing in our results earlier and then the majority of this is coming from our ZBB program and in some part also from the footprint that we started but the majority of them are coming from the ZBB.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And should we think about the footprint savings then continuing through Q2 and those are just starting earlier? Or is it still more back half loaded in 2016?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is still more back half loaded in 2016.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, just \u2013 okay, thank you. And just one quick follow-up. I think you mentioned in the U.S. there was a very little Easter effect, were there any \u2013 I heard a couple of unique factors that affected the quarter. Was Easter a factor overall for the business perhaps in Europe as well?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Hi, Chris. This is George. Thank you for that. Easter for us was effective mainly in shipment. As I said in my remarks, what we saw \u2013 the difference between shipment and consumption was due to three factors mainly. One of them is the shipment timing, as we anticipated large uptake on promotions for Easter, and that was one-off and we would be giving back in the following quarter. The second one was filling the pipeline for the Big Bets NPD that we had and that was a one-off. And the third one, we have about 20% of our U.S. business, comes from foodservice and non-measured channels. And that for us was growing healthy at mid-single-digit in Q1, and we will continue to have a positive outlook on that part of the business.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. There's this thesis out there and I'm sure you've heard it ready espoused by some of your competitors, that you're ripping out promotions too aggressively, and these reductions you're making, they're helping now, but eventually, you'll tick off your customers, you'll lose some display space and you'll suffer. So, I'm just curious, now that you're further into the development of this particular business, can you talk about why that's not a fair assessment? I mean, I know you talked about customer service being a key focus area going forward, but how is your relationship with your larger customers today? And do you see any meaningful risk of shelf space losses ahead as a result of maybe being very aggressive with pulling out some promotions?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ken. Here's Bernardo Hees. I'm going to try to address part of your question, then I'm going to let George jump in to talk about the relationship with the clients and so on. The reason we're confident about the model moving forward, if you think about it, because you believe that efficiencies you're generating put us in a competitive advantage to really support and push an agenda of profitable growth, right, by investing the things we believe can really affect the marketplace, and like we say, really three pillars, is innovation through our Big Bets strategy, more marketing expenditures, and building the go-to-market capability. And if you see what's happening in the company is actually the opposite; you see marketing expenditures going up, selling expenditures going up, and the Big Bets are coming at a faster pace. So, there are a lot of challenge in our categories and like George was saying before, there is still a lot for us to do to overcome them not only here in the United States, but also in different areas of the world. But we truly believe we are preserving and investing where our consumers can see in the marketplace and the efficiencies can help us to have a competitive advantage to push the agenda of profitable growth.","With that, I'm going to let George to complement with the client relationship.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Ken. I think for us, it's worth looking at different category performance. We have some performance in categories, we are really over-performing the category, like ketchup, mustard, pasta sauces, cheeses, Planters, single-serve coffee and we have categories where we are underperforming like frozen meal, bacon hot dogs, salad dressing. I think where we are underperforming, it's largely sometimes we are missing the mark from a consumer trends point of view rather than having a different business model. Our business model applies to all categories similarly. So from a relationship with retailers, we believe we have a very strong relationship, we have a positive relationship and we see a positive outlook there. The most important things between us and our retailers and in my discussion with many of them was whether we can maintain the service level up or not. And we have demonstrated not only we can maintain the service level and the Case Fill Rate, but we actually increased it and we feel good about that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just two questions around the EBITDA growth year-over-year. I guess if you look at it, there was about almost $120 million of EBITDA growth that was above and beyond your cost savings. So one question related to that is how much of that is sort of tailwinds from legacy programs? How much of it is just the favorable spread on price versus commodities? And like, I'm just trying to get underneath how much of that we should keep in our base as we think about the full year?","And then the second related to that is, with some profit upside, will you consider at all either accelerating your investment on revenue generating programs, whether it's Big Bets or filling white space or will you maybe spend more than you were originally thinking, because you've got some upside there?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Bryan, this is Paulo. I'm going to answer the first part of your question and then ask Bernardo to get the second. If you think about the EBITDA, if you isolate the North America, that is U.S. and Canada, the two countries that are really more exposed to the big four commodities in the savings initiatives that we are having this year; the EBITDA improved around $400 million. Out of this, $225 million are coming from our savings program as we disclosed, a bit more than the half the rest is coming from a price net of commodity favorability versus prior year that we are not expecting to repeat going forward. The balance is coming from a combination of other impacts including marketing timing.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","On your \u2013 Bryan, on your question about accelerating the sales initiatives and so on, it's really not too related to the financial capability in that sense and how much you can invest and so there are other considerations like George was saying by \u2013 with the product pipeline having the right consumer insight, testing well, having the right communication about it. So it takes some time and each category is a little different for us to \u2013 really what we call a big bet that we believe can generate the ROI in a significant step forward. So, it's not really having more financial capability or less, but having the discipline in the process to have a product and a proposition that we consider, we consider a winning proposition.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening, everybody.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Of the three items that you talked about as causing some of the differential between shipments and consumption in the first quarter, the first two being Easter and filling of the pipeline behind some of the new items, are the ones that are or you talked about is really not recurring if you will? Is there a way to help quantify the impact that those two things had on overall organic sales in the first quarter to get a sense of what maybe a more sustainable rate of organic sales were in the first quarter?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. Thank you, Andrew. First let me clarify something that we're unlikely to have shipment exactly in line with measured channel consumption in any given quarter. And this is \u2013 the fact is that the major big, the major and big holiday week were sales for us completely stock in consumption and many times they fall in different quarters to where the shipment goes. So your question is very good about, okay, how we can quantify that? The best way to look at it is, about 20% of our business doesn't come from measured channel, so the rest you can see this kind of data the way we see it. That business for us in Q1 grew at around low single digits to-mid single digits, and we expect to continue seeing positive outlook on that business. The other two, one of them was completely one-off. We launched four Big Bets in Q1, so we had one-off pipeline that would have a neutral effect moving forward, and one was timing of shipments between Q1 and Q2 that we'd see some of it reversing.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, I think on the last call, George, you talked about the goal really for organic sales this year as a whole was really to kind of show sales that were stable. And I don't think by stable you necessarily meant flat year-over-year, but just not really subject to a lot of disruption, let's say, from the integration of Kraft and things like that, even accounting for some of these things like pipeline fill and whatnot in the first quarter. It kind of seems like maybe organic sales were maybe more than stable, in other words, you didn't have any big disruptions, and perhaps organic sales were give or take still flattish or so.","So, I guess we're just trying to get a sense of whether you feel like you are even maybe ahead of plan with respect to just organic sales already in this year relative to what maybe your initial hope or expectation had been, and if so, would love to get a sense of the drivers there.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Andrew. You're right, that we did not have any disruption. We have been working very hard to ensure that we didn't get any disruption and we will continue working very hard not to get any disruption moving forward. However, there are a lot of headwind coming at us as you know that is putting downward pressure on sales, because historically in the U.S. market the growth did not come from volume. If you look back for the last number of years, it came from inflation and that inflation was based on commodities inflation.","Now, we are living in an environment where there is no inflation in commodities, so it is harder to be able to say, to have a bullish approach to grow. What we said, and we'll continue to maintain, that we would have stable top line. And as you know, we have an exposure to a large number of commodities, so it's very hard to put exact number to it, but we feel that stability for us is a very good outcome.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Just two questions. So, to be clear, you mentioned that $220 million or the $225 million came from North America, I don't know if you've given the number for the total $1.5 billion before if you can comment on that? And the second question, I mean the EBITDA growth in this quarter was about half driven by those cost savings and then you qualified in one of my previous questions, the fact that some of the drivers of the other half of that EBITDA expansion would not be there in the second half, and that we should assume that the EBITDA growth in the second half is going to be mostly driven by the cost savings. So if you can just expand on that please? Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. So, hi, this is Paulo, Pablo. So let me maybe repeat what I said and explain the bridge. So what I said was that, we have two countries that are exposure today for the savings, for integration plans that we have that are U.S. and Canada, okay? So when you get the EBITDA improvement from these two countries, for the region for North America, the EBITDA improved by $400 million, $225 million came from the sales initiatives that we had. The balance, more than half, a little bit more than half of the balance is coming from price net of commodity that you're not expecting to repeat going forward. In the balance, it's a combination of other initiatives including marking time, not market timing, that was the view that we have.","Going forward, we expect our program savings, it's still ramping up to the year every quarter until we get to the $1.5 billion savings through savings that we expect to see in 2017.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. So, when do you start on a different subject, when do you start looking at SKU cards or is that already happening and looking at divestitures? And related to that, back in the day, Burger King lost The Heinz \u2013 the ketchup business with McDonald's, is that a risk that you would lose the My Caf\u00e9 brand in the coffee business at some point? Thanks.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Pablo. This is George. Let me start answering this backward on the second half of the question. Excuse me for not commenting on commercial relationship between us and our customers. This is a practice that we adopt for all our customers, not just the quick service restaurant.","On the first one, from the SKU rationalization as part of the merger, there was no need for us to run a major SKU rationalization program, so it did not exist to bringing the two businesses together. However, having said that, SKU rationalization or pruning what we call it is always looked at as part of our assortment efficiency, so we do that as part of the disciplined business practice.","It does not have a significant impact that is worthy of reporting, and that's why we do not mention it in our numbers here.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Srivastava of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Vivek Srivastava - Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.","Hi, just a question on trade belt optimization in Europe. In 2015, you were able to have better pricing on back of promotional cuts in U.K. How does 2016 look in terms of promotions in U.K. and are there any new geographies in Europe, where you are thinking of promotion cuts?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Vivek. It's Bernardo. Thanks for the question. I think, this \u2013 your question allows me to comment a little bit about the outperformance in Europe. And I think here, it's important to really separate a Continental Europe from the U.K. We had actually a very solid first quarter in Continental Europe from the Netherlands to Germany, France, Spain, even Italy, that has been more challenge for us. On the infant category, we had a better first quarter. On the other hand, the U.K. that's a significant part of our business, in Europe had key categories that experienced challenges, especially the soup one, that's related to your question about promo activity.","And in the soup, Paulo mentioned that, during the remarks, we came, given the underperformance, we have on the four quarters during the soup season, we decided to protect market share and distribution infusing trade to the system. When you do that, you're already seeing in March, better volumes and better results and moving forward in U.K., we believe with the summer season coming and so on, we should see and should experience a sequential better quarters moving forward in U.K. I think in Europe as a group, what happened in the soup U.K. is a specific category and is a specific challenge situation from the retail environment and comparatives.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening, thanks. You call that a few of the factors impacting EBITDA in Europe during the quarter in promotion and marketing spend. As we think about the near-term impact on results of a whitespace launch into a new category like mayonnaise. Are there meaningful upfront costs associated with that kind of expansion, how should we think about the impact of a launch like that during its first year in the market?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Matthew. No, I don't think there's nothing that's not in our plan already. So in a sense it's not that we're going to have higher cost because of the whitespace. You're right to say that given the investment and so on there is a migration of margins that's going to accelerate in the second year, third year and so as we ramp up the awareness, distribution, and so on. But I don't think that's that significant to change the way we think about the business in that sense. I think it's fair to say that our underperformance in the soup season in U.K. forced us to take other measures to put back distribution and market share. That's correct.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right, thank you. And then, could I just ask one more on the U.S. coffee category? You called out the category as an area, where you had strong PNOC and also some volume growth, based on scanner data, it seems to be a case where the volume is mostly coming from single-serve. While in roast and ground, you're sacrificing some amount of volume, I guess on the roast and ground piece specifically, are you comfortable with the balance you have there between promotional spending and volumes?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, thank you, Matthew. This is George. I'll take that. In the coffee category, you are right to separate the roast and ground from the pods business or the single-serve. The decline in roast and ground is largely due to pricing. As you know, we had a deflationary impact in the marketplace, and that put downward pressure on pricing, the volume is declining, but that's slightly. So, that's not the bigger issue for us. And we are seeing and it has been going on for some time now, consumer shift towards the more convenient pods or single-serve categories.","In this category, we are very pleased with our performance. As you know from the scanner data, we grew at over 13% year-to-date, compared to a category growth of 6.9%, so that is twice the category growth, and that's where we believe the future is going to be. We are also comfortable with where we are at from profitability point of view, during the time of deflation.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, George.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Matthew.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good evening. Just as you look at your margin opportunity, say two years or three years out, how do you think about what the opportunity is over and above the savings? Do you do a bottoms-up for you? Do you do benchmarking, is it both of those? And where do you see where that can go? And then just a housekeeping question on volume and mix, can you give a sense of what the split is between those two?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Michael, let me start with the second. We don't break down volume mix when you see the number of categories and brands that we have, we don't provide this breakdown. In relation with the first question again, we have this program today that we are very focused to deliver, but again when you see, we're always going to be looking for in \u2013 we always benchmark ourselves, we benchmark the expense that we have, a lot of work in terms of what's the best way for us to provide in the cost to serve in the company, but yes, that's right, we're going keep the ZBB program, is a program that it refresh itself every year.","So again, all the tools that we have, I'm sure that it will allow us, to be every time reviewing this and pushing more to have a more efficient company.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And just in terms of where you might ever hit a wall or if there is limits to that? Do you have ways you can measure or try to quantify that?","Bernardo Vieira Hees - Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael, it's Bernardo. Look, the experience we have and the way we think about those tools forward was mentioned just a couple of minutes ago, it's much more as a system than really a one-off or it's not the way we do things here, that's why our thinking is very long-term in that sense. So ZBB MBO revenue management, all the innovation pipeline, the way we follow through the process here, we're looking 2016, 2017, 2020, 2025 and is a system. So our experience tells us, that's not a question of having a wall or not a wall like you're saying. It's a question as a system to prepare and to accept value where there are. And sometimes, you're going to be infusing quarter, taking cost that doesn't matter, but the system works in a way that you can identify the opportunity and invest behind, not only from a top line, but from bottom line. So if the process is working properly, I don't believe the situation is a one-off that to cross the line, because we self correct ourselves in a very fast way.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good evening. Your gross margin gain of over 550 basis points in the quarter, that was even more than the fourth quarter which surprised us, particularly, because the promotion comparisons were not as easy as that quarter. You mentioned that pricing net of commodities was favorable, how much of the gross margin gain would be what you would call commodity timing? And perhaps what are some of the other drivers that you would call out for gross margin specifically?","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, David. Again, I think, as I was explaining, we had this benefit from the price net of commodity in the first quarter, that's prior year, that for sure was a benefit in terms of gross margin. We also had a piece of our savings a little bit less than half of the savings that $225 million, that is going \u2013 is coming \u2013 is appearing in the COGS that both of these factors or those of the facts impact the gross margin and kind of explain the majority of the improvement we had in the gross margin ratio.","Again, that's not the clear way that we track the business, generally we separate more between contribution margin, variable cost and fixed cost. But those were the main facts that we had in the gross profit.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is there any color that you could offer about what's driving that mid-single-digit growth that you see sustainable on the foodservice area?","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, David. Yes. The foodservice is not just a foodservice area, it's foodservice and other non-measured channels. So, it is anything that goes into club stores, commissaries, foodservice and Dollar General. For one, these businesses tend to have a higher rate of growth than the measured channels, and two, as I mentioned on the last call, we initiated a major whitespace and business development program that started to payoff, and we continue to see a positive outflow for these businesses.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then one last one on advertising spending, in the quarter, does that increase become behind some of those Big Bets, and what's your general plan for ad spending for the year? Thanks very much.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, the advertising as we said on the last call that would be increased in the U.S. by about $50 million year-on-year, and the majority of this is being put behind the Big Bets. You would've seen the advertising so far on the new items that we have launched this Q1 and Q2 where the most of these advertising actually being spent and we will continue into Q3 and Q4.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Georges El-Zoghbi - Chief Operating Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you so much for taking the question. Two, if I may. First, can you just talk about how you think about some of the secured debt in your structure, whether there is a focus on trying to clean that up and have only unsecured borrowings given that you are an investment grade issuer? And then just secondly, can you talk a little bit about the rationale behind the $4 billion commercial paper program you put in place recently and just in terms of the size of that versus your ongoing needs? Thank you.","Paulo Luiz Ara\u00fajo Bas\u00edlio - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Priya. Again as you know, we have intention to redeem the prefer as soon as it gets callable beginning of June. We've talked a lot how accretive this transaction would be in terms of cash flow and earnings and EPS for the company. We are considering how close we are to access the market. I would prefer and I will disclose this information soon, as soon as we access the markets. But we are intended to access the market in the near-term.","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back to Chris Jakubik for closing remarks.","Christopher M. Jakubik - Vice President-Investor Relations, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.","Okay.
