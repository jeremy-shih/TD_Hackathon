Your lines will remain in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today's call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Candice. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2017 financial results, along with our updated outlook for 2017. In addition, as previously mentioned, we will be providing an updated financial outlook for 2020 as compared to the expectations we laid out at our investor conference in May of 2016. As a reminder, we have posted a supplemental presentation to complement this morning's discussion. This presentation, along with the related non-GAAP reconciliations, can be accessed at Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events and Presentations.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I will get started with a brief look at our second-quarter results. Then I will share some highlights reflecting the progress and potential of our ongoing business transformation and conclude with an update to our 2020 guidance. After that, I will turn the call over to Jay, who will walk through our second-quarter results and financial outlook in more detail. We'll close with Q&A.","Baxter delivered another solid Quarter 2 with top-line sales growth of 1% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis. Operationally, Baxter's sales increased 3% which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide and the previously communicated strategic exits the company is undertaking. Key top-line drivers included strong U.S. performance in Fluid Systems, nutrition and anesthesia, as well steady global growth in PD and acute renal therapies.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.63 per diluted share, increasing 37% over the prior year period. This reflects solid top-line growth, improved gross margins and a steady impact of our ongoing business transformation efforts. A little over a year ago we outlined our roadmap for achieving sustained top quartile performance. As part of this transformation, we created a foundation that is redefining how we do business and deliver value for our patients, employees and shareholders.","To date, we have made great progress rather in executing this transformation and our focus on positioning the company for continued success. I will share a few recent highlights that support this objective. We expect to close our proposed acquisition of Claris Injectables imminently. This acquisition broadens our presence and prospects in generic injectable pharmaceuticals and provides expanded capabilities in one of our core growth areas.","Claris brings us a product portfolio of more than 50 products on the market and the robust pipeline of more than 100 new products in development. We will continue to augment this business with strategic partnerships like the agreement we signed in the quarter with the result life sciences to accelerate the development of more than 20 generic injectables.","During the quarter, we also announced research and clinical development collaborations with leading institutions. Mayo Clinic and Ramot at Tel Aviv University and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center to transform patient care with new technologies and products across an array of therapeutic areas, including renal care and surgical care, respectively.","We also received FDA guidance in the quarter clarifying the regulatory pathway for a new home-based PD solution generations system. This technology has the potential to remove some existing barriers to home-based dialysis, enabling more patients to experience the lifestyle benefits of home therapy.","We will continue expanding our research and development pipeline with significant investment targeted to new product developed and additional collaborations to accelerate growth through 2020 and beyond. And while the pipeline continues to expand, we are also maintaining a steady tempo of new product launches, new indications and geographic expansions across our global portfolio.","Our progress and pace have also been reinforced by continuing evolution in our operating structure and leadership. Over the last few months, we have partnered built our \u2013 built outs, rather, our leadership team with some familiar names in the new positions and some talented new players joining the company. With Paul Vibert's recent retirement, we are in process of simplifying our geographic structure into three regions \u2013 the Americas, including North and South America; EMEA, or Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific.","Brik Eyre is now serving as President of our Americas region. On boarding this week is Andy Frye, our new President of Asia-Pacific. He joins us from DKSH Healthcare, one of the largest service providers in Asia where he served as the Global Head of Healthcare. Cristiano Franzis has been named our new President of EMEA effective September 1. Most recently Cristiano served as President, Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, EMEA, for Medtronic. Giuseppe Accogli now has an expanded role as President, Global Businesses, responsible for driving global growth through strategy, product development and marketing for the business franchises within Hospital Products and Renal.","And Sumant Ramachandra joined us in June as our new Chief Science and Technology Officer. Sumant was most recently Senior Vice President and Head of R&D for Pfizer Essential Health. This leadership team is aligned, energized and ready to lead the charge forward.","In light of our progress, trajectory and potential, we are now prepared to update our 2020 guidance. We are projecting sales to grow approximately 4% on a compounded annual basis from 2016 to 2020. We expect a 2020 adjusted operating margin of approximately 20% and adjusted earnings of $3.25 to $3.40 per diluted share. Finally, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $2 billion.","We are pleased with these increases and will continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate this performance both organically and inorganically. We continue to see business development playing a crucial role in building out our portfolio and pipeline. Focused on key growth categories and adjacencies, this will be enabled by our healthy cash flow, allowing us to deploy capital to create value on both the top and bottom line.","In parallel, we will remain relentless in our efforts to increase efficiency, process improvements, more expanding and the engagement of all Baxter employees who have been fundamental to our transformation to date and we will continue to fuel reinvestment and margin expansion in future quarters.","In sum, we have arrived at the next phase of our transformation journey and just like before, persistent, discipline, execution points the way forward. We have a sound strategy in our leadership teams fully engaged to help us realize our goals. Most importantly, we have exceptional talent across the entire company that embraces our mission to save and sustain patients' lives and advance our aspirations to deliver top quartile performance for all of our stakeholders. Together, we are ready to set our sights higher.","With that, I will pass it to Jay for a closer look at our financials.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results, reinforcing our confidence that we are on the right path to achieve our goal of sustaining top quartile performance. Sales in the quarter increased 1% on a reported basis, 2% constant currency and 3% operationally, in line with our expectations. The results were really driven by strength across many of our U.S. businesses and improving operational growth internationally. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.63 per diluted share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share and reflects solid execution on the top-line, the ongoing impacts from our business transformation efforts and a modest benefit from other income and a lower tax rate.","Now I will walk you through performance by business. I will be speaking to growth figures on an operational basis to provide a clearer understanding of underlying performance. As a reminder, our operational basis presentation excludes the impact of foreign exchange, U.S. cyclophosphamide, and selected strategic product exits.","Global sales for Hospital Products were $1.6 billion, advancing 4% operationally. Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $607 million, up 6% operationally. Performance was primarily driven by strong sales of IV solutions in the U.S.","Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS, global sales were $568 million, increasing 4% operationally. Contributing to performance in the quarter was increased demand for the company's nutritional therapies in the U.S., driven by a temporary market disruption for select nutritional products. Sales for premixed injectable drugs also increased in the quarter, driven by recent launches and incremental pull-through of other premixed injectable products in our portfolio.","Moving to Surgical Care, which includes anesthesia and biosurgery, total sales were $352 million, increasing 3% operationally. Performance in the quarter was fueled by strong U.S. growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by increased sales of Brevibloc, a fast-acting IV beta blocker, and Transderm Scop. We did experience a slight benefit in the quarter as the alternate supplier for Transderm Scop returned to the market a bit later than expected.","Globally, biosurgery sales slightly declined during the quarter. Mid-single digit growth of core hemostats and sealants was more than offset by the impact from lower sales of non-core products, such as PERI-STRIPS and ACTIFUSE.","Finally, in Hospital Products, sales in our other category were $110 million, declining 10%. Growth in the quarter was impacted by lower demand for our contract manufacturing services in our Bloomington, Indiana, facility and lower manufacturing service revenues from Shire.","Turning to Renal business, sales were $968 million, up 3% operationally. Sales in the quarter benefited from solid sales of peritoneal dialysis and acute renal care products. The in-center hemodialysis business advanced low single digits globally, driven by strong sales in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales internationally.","The Acute business delivered mid single-digit growth globally in the quarter, driven by increased sales internationally. Growth in the U.S. slowed in the quarter given a difficult year-over-year comparison as sales in Q2 2016 benefited from a temporary market disruption for continuous renal replacement solutions. We expect growth in this business to return to double digits in the back half of the year.","Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 45.2% represents an improvement of 140 basis points over the prior year, driven by improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio, favorable manufacturing performance and a benefit from our business transformation efforts aimed at simplifying the portfolio to drive efficiency and reduce cost.","Adjusted SG&A totaled $603 million, decreasing 9% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on effectively managing our expense base to eliminate costs and reduce inefficiencies. Transition service agreement totaled \u2013 income totaled approximately $16 million in the quarter, a reduction of approximately $10 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. We expect transition service incomes to total approximately $20 million in the second half of 2017.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $155 million increased 3% versus the prior year. This reflects our stated intention to increase investments in R&D to drive innovation and augment top-line growth.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.1%, an improvement of 380 basis points versus the prior year. Operating margin compared favorably to our expectations, driven by improved gross margin and disciplined expense management.","Net interest expense was $13 million in the quarter, as was adjusted other income, which totaled $13 million in the quarter. This reflected a benefit from foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions. The adjusted tax rate was 16.9% for the quarter, which reflects the benefit from the new stock compensation guidance, along with select discrete items. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.63 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57 per share, driven by operational strength, other income benefit and a lower tax expense.","During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $45 million or approximately 750,000 shares. These targeted repurchases were more than offset by option-related dilution.","Before turning to our updated outlook, I will provide some commentary regarding our cash flow performance. On a year-to-date basis, we've generated free cash flow of $488 million, an improvement of more than $400 million versus the prior year, driven by strong operational performance and lower capital expenditures, along with continued focus on improving the company's working capital performance. Of particular note, we ended the quarter with DSO of 53 days and days payable of 52 days.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2017 and 2020. Starting with 2017, we expect full-year sales to increase approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, select strategic product exits and removing the benefit from the proposed Claris acquisition, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%. All three of these sales ranges represent an increase from our prior guidance. This growth reflects approximately $55 million in incremental sales from the Claris acquisition, which, as Joe said, we expect to close imminently.","We now expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and 5% to 6% operationally. Within Hospital Products, we now expect Fluid Systems constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6% and 7% to 8% on an operational basis. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions business, we expect constant currency sales growth of 4% to 5%.","We expect full-year sales for cyclophosphamide of approximately $160 million as compared to our previous guidance of $135 million. Our updated assumption is that additional competitors will enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2017. And as I just mentioned, we anticipate that Claris will add approximately $55 million of revenues to IPS. Operationally, IPS sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%.","Within Surgical Care we now anticipate sales to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% operationally. And finally, for the Hospital Products business we now expect DPS and other to increase low single-digits.","For the Renal business, we expect full year constant currency sales to increase approximately 3% and growth of approximately 4% operationally.","Moving down the P&L, we now expect an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.5% to 16%. We expect net interest expense to total approximately $60 million and other income of approximately $20 million for 2017.","For the year, we now expect an average adjusted cash rate of approximately 19.5%. For full year 2017 we anticipated diluted average share count of approximately 555 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2017 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.34 to $2.40 per diluted share.","Finally, for the year, we are increasing our outlook and now expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion.","Specific to the third quarter 2017, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 4% on a reported basis and increase approximately 5% on a constant currency basis. Operationally, sales in the third quarter are expected to increase approximately 6%. Claris is expected to contribute approximately $20 million in sales to the third quarter. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.58 to $0.60 per diluted share.","Before opening up the call to Q&A, I'd like to expand a bit on our updated longer-term financial outlook. Since we provided our updated projections last May, we have been very focused on opportunities for improvement. Our solid operational performance to date has positioned us well for continued success.","As Joe stated, we expect sales growth of 4% compounded annually. While our sales outlook has not changed, I do want to point out a couple of factors. Top-line performance in 2016 came in better than we had projected in May 2016. And the guidance provided last year did not incorporate the select strategic exits we undertook this year. These two factors offset the expected benefit from the Claris acquisition. In addition, as we approach 2020 we expect sales growth to be north of 4% on annual basis as we benefit from the actions we've taken to optimize the portfolio and drive increased productivity from our pipeline investments.","The adjusted operating margin of 20% compares favorably to previous guidance of 17% to 18% and reflect continued momentum from our business transformation efforts as well as improve manufacturing performance. In 2020, we expect adjusted EPS of $3.25 to $3.40 per share, representing a mid-teen increase from the prior guidance of $2.75 to $3 dollars per share.","Our EPS outlook does not assume any meaningful share repurchases. We've only modeled repurchases to offset dilution, holding our share count flat to 2017 levels. In addition, we've not included any additional meaningful business development initiatives beyond the Claris acquisition in these projections.","For me, one of the most important numbers Joe mentioned earlier is our increased cash flow outlook. We expect to generate more than $2.6 billion in operating cash flow by 2020. We will further reduce CapEx spending which is expected to be less than 6% of sales by 2020, resulting in free cash flow improving approximately $250 million to approximately $2 billion in 2020.","And to rephrase my earlier comment, this is an unlevered view of our business. It does not reflect any meaningful deployment of the balance sheet other than the repurchase of shares to offset dilution. Similar to our previous guidance, this plan was built from the bottoms up. We're pleased with this update but as always, we'll look for ways to enhance this performance. And 2020 by no means represents the peak, or rather just another step in our journey. We expect to host an Investor Day during the second quarter of 2018 where we will provide a review of our business strategies, product pipeline, innovation, along with a more extended financial outlook.","With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and additional replay will be available on the Baxter International's website for the 60 days at www.Baxter.com. And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on another impressive quarter here. So maybe one on the LRP and I'm curious the revenue outlook of 4%, that wasn't changed. I mean, just given the underlying momentum we're seeing in the business, I'm curious why that was maintained and does the LRP contemplate any increase in gross margins?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. Vijay, thanks for the question. So just commenting on your second question first with respect to gross margin performance over the LRP. In last year's iteration of our financial projections, we shared an operating margin of roughly 17% to 18%, we've increased that to 20% in our current look at 2020. But to decompose the 17% to 18%, we were really in the range of 44% to 45% on a gross margin standpoint. R&D was roughly 5% and then SG&A was 22%.","As we moved to this year's LRP, there are a number of areas of improvement. One of the biggest relates to gross margin where we now expect roughly a 46% gross margin in 2020. There are a number of contributing factors to this. I said in the past I've been very pleased with the manufacturing performance under the leadership of Scott Pleau. That team has been incredibly focused on driving cost savings and improvements in the manufacturing network.","So we expect to see some of that. But on the gross margin line we'll also benefit from mix as we move forward as we did exit some lower margin sales and then furthermore as we look at the inclusion of Claris in our projections.","To complete the picture, R&D is basically unchanged versus the prior iteration and SG&A improves another hundred basis points, again, driven by continued and relentless focus on cost. So that's really the picture from a margin standpoint.","As it relates to sales projections, yes, I think it's safe to say we've been very pleased with the sales performance of our business, right? And as we look at the LRP, really the biggest changes for us are a couple of fold. One, we've included Claris so the IPS business now will grow faster than we previously expected but then we did exit certain strategic lower margin sales areas. And so we do have an impact on Fluid Systems and on the Renal business. Those business growths are down a little bit from the prior version of the LRP.","So as we sit here today, obviously we're looking to accelerate wherever possible. And in fact, Joe's comments and my comments around innovation, as we look over long-term, we're looking to accelerate the pace of innovation and pull-forward where possible. But as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with the 4%.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Absolutely. And then just one follow-up, guys, on just maybe the guidance for the current fiscal. You look at the one half versus second half mix the last couple of years, it's been somewhere in 40% to 45% in one half versus 55% to 60% in the second half. I know you have a number of items hitting you in the back half, including the TSA transition. The guidance basically implies the mix is more 50-50 this year. Can you walk us through that, Jay?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Certainly. We would normally expect to see an uptick in the second half EPS just based on natural business trends. And that's something that we've seen over the last several years. There are several factors that we have to be mindful of. First of all, transition service income. We expect Shire to wind down their need for our services, and right now that's a $0.03 headwind first-half to second-half.","Secondly, we did from a cyclo-performance standpoint, we have roughly $0.04 of deterioration, $0.03 to $0.04 of deterioration first-half to second-half.","Third, we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments, I think these are very strategic and important. And as we get to your first question in relation to how do we accelerate sales growth, it's very much about pulling forward timelines as much as possible, something our team is really focused on. R&D tics up roughly $0.03 in the second half of the year.","And then finally, the way the tax rate works with the benefits related to FASB 123(NYSE:R), typically those benefits are concentrated in the first half of the year, and so we do see the tax rate ticking up $0.03 to $0.04. And finally, we have other income and interest which is $0.01 \u2013 or there's a $0.01 impact in the second half of the year.","So as we look at the first half to the second half, there are roughly $0.14 to $0.15 of headwinds as we analyzed it, that we fight through to give the guidance that we've shared with you today.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks. Congratulations.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can stick in two questions here. For one, can you talk about the Claris accretion to your 2020 guidance with what the expected EPS contribution would be? And then second, just want to make sure I'm reading the cap allocations slide correctly on the dividend? So is the assumption that the dividend payout ratio is still 35% or something below that?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes. From a Claris standpoint, we expect roughly $0.05 of accretion in 2020, a little bit north of that. And then from a dividend payout ratio, our expectation is to maintain over the long term this targeted payout ratio of 35% of adjusted net income.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, Jay, it was helpful.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","As you know, we are not doing today-","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Joe, we just want to get your kind of latest thoughts on business development. On the last quarter call we talked about the potential for larger acquisitions, and it felt I think to the Street, as if the likelihood of larger transactions may be diminished over the course of the quarter. So can you just give us your latest read on kind of what's out there and what's the likelihood of different sizes occurring?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure, Mike. Just augmenting Jay's previous answer on Claris, we are giving this guidance on Claris for 2020 as Claris is today. Claris for Baxter is the foundation of getting us to a significant number of molecules in other areas. So when we speak about Claris itself as Claris is today as it transitions over there, there's significant amount of investment that we are going to be making in new molecules that we'll be adding to the pharmaceutical business of Baxter, which we plan to be much bigger than just Claris.","On the business development, we have a significant capacity in our balance sheet, organic and inorganic, meaning we are generating a significant amount of cash. I think Jay has spoken about our conversion ratio is really good. It is one of the best I've seen, the team has done a great job. So our natural generation of cash flows well we can borrow put us in a very good position. So what is the difference between where I am right now and a big acquisition and several tuck-ins that will get to the value that we had spoken last quarter but in a different way.","Clearly, there is custody of large targets as we all know. So, and also when you look into the financials and how that works with a company, you have an inherited risk pertinent to these kinds of transactions. They are much greater than several smaller transactions. So as we look at how to pursue our inorganic pathway here, first of all, put a strong team in place. And I just bought my old team back, almost the whole team back from my old job into Baxter. And that team will be now responsible for M&A. The second thing is that for me it doesn't matter. If you do a large deal, it's going to take us a while to digest and will probably take us a while to continue down the path of further acquisitions versus smaller deals.","So as we evaluate both, we have \u2013 we're open for both. It's not that one is losing to the other; it's what are the opportunities that we'll return to our shareholders what we want the shareholders to have. Remember, we want internal rate of returns. They are significant above our weighted average cost of capital, and in the double digits. We want ROIC three years to five years to have close to the company average. So we have put some limits in how we're going to use our shareholders' money.","The other alternative that we have, we have said that money's not going to burn a hole in our pocket. So if we do have excess cash, we will buy shares back at our discretion when we think is the most effective way of doing so. We're opening both channels and we can do both at the same time because of the amount of cash that we have.","So as we pursue diligently and with significant amount of grit our M&A path, we also will be returning money to the shareholders in terms of shares buyback. So I want to leave those channels open. And size of acquisition is less important than about the strategic fit of those companies within our portfolio.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. I'll let some others jump in. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Taylor of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on some of the thoughts on the Claris accretion and maybe just spin this into a discussion around how you think the mix could improve with your injectable initiative in general. Could you give us some thoughts on the different partnerships that you have, Claris and in your internal programs? And what do you think the margin structure of that business could look like over the course of the LRP because, as you know, not all injectable businesses are created equal?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes. We feel that we have three pathways here. We had our internal programs, which I thought were good but not at all sufficient. Those are good molecules. Our internal program, when we first arrived at Baxter, were related to things that are difficult to create. In solutions, we stabilized. We're looking at our GALAXY technology in Round Lake, Illinois, to make them. And our pace was one of not great speed, okay. So that program could not only \u2013 would not get us what we want.","Claris adds a piece to the puzzle, which is the ability to do the filling operations and packaging, also the procurement of APIs and manufacturing of APIs in a very cost-effective way with good quality product. We are expanding now with the ScinoPharm and as well as Dorizoe partnerships to be able to get more volume of molecules. But this is not volume of a million-dollar molecule. We're looking at molecules that are more relevant to the portfolio, therefore creating good accretion to the gross margin.","If you think about this business, this is a business with a low SG&A. So it's all about gross margin here And gross margin is providing the market with effective supply chain that creates a cost advantage for us in the market and for the customer. So with 45% and Jay said 46% by 2020, we feel this business has a bigger capacity to deliver on a gross margin, but more so, Matt, is down the P&L with very low SG&A, okay.","So we are actively, actively pursuing more partnerships and with all kinds of different companies, either for distribution of the drug, for augmentation of portfolio, for the design of these generics, which is the case of hard-to-make oncolytics with ScinoPharm or just capacity to develop the API new formulation with Dorizoe. So it's all in \u2013 when you put together, it is a business. It's a core growth business for us, which is the definition is, has better gross margin, better growth rates, change to vector growth and also impacts our operating income and our EPS.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, some helpful perspective. And I just wanted to follow up on the Fluid Systems business. That continues to perform very well. I know you've been saying it kind of gets the trophy every quarter for best-performing business. And I just wanted to understand some of the dynamics there between, I guess, the competitive environment and share gains, how you're doing on pricing, and some of the pull through. If maybe you could touch on those things to understand how much longer you can continue to grow above market like this?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Well, if you think about the Fluid business in general, we came back to the market with an effective pump strategy. We have probably 22%, 22.5%, 23% market share in pumps and where we are today, and I'm talking about the U.S. per se. So let's focus on the U.S. as the Fluids business outside the U.S. is completely different characteristics and profit profile. So the pumps in the U.S., the SIGMA SPECTRUM, we have a nice momentum on product development. We're going to be launching the new revised version of SIGMA with auto-programmable functions and other features next year. And then we have a pathway all the way to a new platform not too far in the future. That is the foundation of creating momentum in terms of our Fluids business. Fluids themselves is all about capacity and quality.","And right now I feel confident that we're working very hard on both fronts. So we have product availability as much as we can and we're augmenting capacity, we're validating new lines in our North America planned footprint.","So the ability to provide product to the market at a higher rate is one that will determine in the future our ability to continue to grow. Remember those products are not sold in the spot market. Those are created through contract and those are long-term contracts. So as long as Baxter has the capability to continue to provide those long-term contracts where price escalation is built-in. Second, we have invested in the right capacity, meaning what is the right capacity \u2013 it's capacity in the right places and we are. And we maintain the quality required by the FDA. We will be continue to deliver on this business.","Clearly there is a point where there is a reduction in growth just by the sheer volume of products that we make. We're number one in the market in terms of solutions. So we would expect this business to taper off a little bit in growth but our expectation is, as we continue to augment capacity, we continue to gain market share. And I think this is something that our team here in North America is doing a significant amount of work and will continue on to be able to provide products to our customers.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the thought.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and I'll echo the earlier sentiments on another good quarter, guys. Let me start with the 2020 margin \u2013 operating margin target. Could you talk about how you thought about that target in 2020? Is there some conservatism baked in? Is there room for further expansion beyond the 20% in 2020 \u2013 beyond 2020, I'm talking about and how should we think about the path to 20%? Should we think about it linear between 2017 and 2020? And I did have one follow-up. Thanks.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Okay. Larry, thanks for the question. Overall, from a margin standpoint, the first comment I would make is we do not believe that 20% is the peak. In fact, as we share our guidance in May of next year we'll extend beyond 2020. And you heard Joe make some earlier comments about a business' life, our injectables business, there's incredible excitements around that in part because of the higher margin those businesses carry than the Baxter corporate average. So as we move from 2020 to beyond, we start to get lift from mix and innovation really, really accelerating and helping the margin improvement.","In terms of how we develop the target as a conservative or not, it's the same methodology that we've used over the last three years for developing our long-range financial planning commitments. Specifically, we have programs earmarked from a bottoms-up standpoint that sum total to 20%. In the past, I've talked with investors about outside-in and comparing to competitors and using that as a basis. But for us, we've never done that. We've always done bottoms up initiative by initiative. And so we know exactly how we're going to get from where we are today, 15.5% to 16%, to the 2020 target of 20%. And, in fact, as we leave this call, Joe and I will be going to a zero-based budgeting meeting where we will be reviewing many of the savings initiatives that support this 2020 objective.","As far as the linearity of this, I don't want to get into guidance discussions for 2018 at this point. What I will tell you is, it is now like there's 300 basis points of improvement in a particular year. It is fairly balanced. But again, I'll stop short of giving annual targets for margin improvement.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That was, I guess, on the guidance. My follow-up question was just on the 4% CAGR. What's the \u2013 on this revenue, what's the definition of that? It includes Claris, but it doesn't include other business development. And I did hear you say, Jay, that you expect, or maybe Joe, accelerating above for as you come to 2020, my question was going to be around how to think about 2018, anything different from 2017? Should we be thinking about it in a similar way? Not sure if you're willing to kind of give us some of the puts and takes at this point. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Hi Larry. The way we think about the top-line is the following. Our weighted average market growth rate, or WAMGR, is about 3%, okay. So we have a 4% plan which is significant amount of new product launches, geographic expansion, things you're putting in to grow above market. Primarily not growth categories, oaky, as we outlined in our presentations in the past. We call core growth.","When you look at how to get to 5% is basically execution, excellence on those initiatives and the risk in those initiatives. So the more we de-risk our initiatives, the more we fill our bullpen of new opportunities, we can possibly get to 5%. It's a stretch, it's not easy, and I'm not saying we're going to get there, but we have a lot of Baxter people probably listening to this call, we are getting ready to get there because we're executing., we're doing everything we can. We brought good people from the outside with excellent people from inside, and we're mixing our teams with very good execution people. So we have a possibility to get there. But right now we feel that with all we have on the table, 4% is adequate for our shareholders to model our growth going forward. But we're working hard to get to 5%","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just two questions. One short and one longer-term. Jay, maybe you for the short-term question. I think about the second quarter and back half of the year from an organic growth perspective. So momentum slowed a little bit in the second quarter, but your guidance implies a fairly material acceleration in organic growth into the third quarter. And then you have the easy comp in the fourth quarter. So I think about the 5% guidance at the top end. It looks like if you can do the third quarter, frankly, you'd more than do that in the fourth quarter. So could you just help us understand the acceleration into the third quarter, and how you think the third quarter will play out in terms of your back half of the year growth guidance?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. One important point relates to Claris, and so as we think about the growth rate for the third quarter, there is some benefit from Claris, roughly $15 million in the third quarter. Or actually is it $15 million or $20 million do we say?","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","$20 million.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","$20 million, sorry. $20 million in the third quarter, so that's one item. As far as other areas, there is some acceleration outside the U.S. and part of the business outside the U.S. relates to tenders. So as we look at some of our regions, our EMEA region, our Asia-Pacific region, we do see a sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 based on the timing of tenders, which is a little bit different than we've seen in prior quarters and years. So really that is one of the factors that drives this acceleration into the third quarter. And then, of course, we had a solid Q4 last year. So that factors into our math.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. But can you sustain those levels, sorry Jay, into the fourth quarter? But then the comp gets a little easier. It just feels like whatever you deliver in the third quarter, you should be able to do consistent growth in the fourth quarter just based on the easier comparable.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Again, we also have cyclo which tails off a little bit in the fourth quarter, so that's a factor as we look at pure constant currency growth. So that's another element to consider. I think as we look at the second-half growth, we feel confident in our ability to achieve it. There are some nuances between Q3 and Q4 related to timing of tenders' performance in Q4 cyclo. But on balance, I think it's consistent with what we've expected. And like I said, we feel confident in our ability to deliver it.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jay. And then two long-term questions first. Jay, I'll start with you and then finish with Joe. So, Jay, I don't know if you can give an EBITDA margin guidance update on this call. I think you initially had said 24% to 25%. Obviously, the EBIT margins are fantastic. So if you think about EBITDA in 2020, just given the tremendous improvements you've had on CapEx and the impacts on depreciation, how do we think about EBITDA guidance in 2020?","And then for Joe, I think all these questions about organic growth on the call are trying to get to sort of one question which is if you can do 6% operationally in the third quarter, are you really saying you're going to see some deceleration in the business intermediate-term before you get acceleration into 2019 and 2020, or are we just making more of this than we should be and these numbers may be a little conservative? Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","So let me start with your question and Jay will talk to you about EBITDA. One of the growths in the quarter-to-quarter basis is about comps from the previous quarter. We need to look at sequential and we also need to look at sustainability. So we feel comfortable with the long-term being 4% because we look at how our programs are being factored into the growth and also the tenders that we have. Remember we have a static business in terms of products that we sell. And if we're out of a tender, we're out of a tender. This is the issue that we had in Europe in the last 18 months is we're out of spme tenders because we didn't want to bid. When we get back in, it guarantees the business for the longer term.","So I feel comfortable that we are \u2013 that the 6% is to be delivered in the quarter. But going forward, we want to make sure that we are at about 4% level. And this is because we are looking at more sequential growth and sustainable growth. We will have quarters that have higher growth and lower growth like we just had this quarter because of discontinuation of business. But in the mean we want to have that 4% there and target 5%.","The delivery of our second-half, we'll not be giving no guidance today and affirming the numbers. If we couldn't do it, I'm confident about our ability to deliver on that as we speak today. However, that should not be something that the analysts should be thinking about for us going forward, okay. Because it is quarter-by-quarter, we look at more long-term.","So the 4%, David, may have \u2013 has an acceleration towards the end of the period that we provide you guidance with the 2020. We will have an acceleration so we can make that number happen based on the numbers for 2018 and based on the discontinued products that we have.","I just want to also tell that \u2013 say that these numbers, organic, is completely unlevered but we continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions that will help us on an inorganic side for the next 12 months, but also they will bring pipeline into the company and will help us with organic going forward. So it is a combination but right today we're sticking to the 4%.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","David, the EBITDA margin in 2020 is approximately 26%.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you. First question on the long-term guidance. I was just trying to go through some of the moving parts that were yet uncovered and one was on share count. I just want to confirm that you're assuming that you believe perhaps in a share repurchase offset \u2013 options solutions but not assuming that there will be a meaningful net reduction in share count through 2020. Is that sort of the right way to think about it?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","That's exactly right. In our modeling, we've held share counts flat to 2017 levels.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","And underlying that is an assumption about a certain amount of buyback. But the result of that, given the very strong cash flow generation of the company, is a serious positive net debt or net asset position as we look at cash relative to growth stat.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right. Great. That's what I was getting at. Thank you. And then a follow up on just a couple of the product specifics. Biosurgery, you guys mentioned the slight decline there. But I think you also talked a little bit about how your pretty strong pipeline is in 2018. So I'm just trying to handicap how we should think about the recovery to growth. Is it going to be sort of a sharper inflection towards this time next year or could we see an improvement sooner than that?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","So we have a significant amount of activity going on at the end of this year and into 2018 for biosurgery. What is affecting us today is the performance of the Synovis acquisition products. They were made by the company a few years ago. Those are products that are legacy, there are very little improvement to those products to be made, and what we are focusing on our hemostats and sealants, the base business of Baxter which just in one category, just the FLOSEAL alone is growing 7%, okay. So that is good growth there.","So for us to return to a market growth rate, this is what we expect to do in 2018, okay. And then we look forward to some augmentation inorganically speaking into that business that will help us deliver more pipeline in some adjacencies into the surgery business. I'm quite confident in the delivery of this new products. They are not homeruns, they're singles and doubles, but just reignite the innovation that the company has not delivered in the past years. And just the new management into that business is really instilling the innovation part quite a bit. That's why we're having so many things happening next year. We have launch of new forms of FLOSEAL, new applicators, new geographic expansion. So will get back into this game in a good way and beginning to see that transformation in 2018 in terms of getting to market growth.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Isaac.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. So just two quick things since a lot of questions have been asked. Joe, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the leadership changes this year referring to on this call. Just in terms of kind of when that happened and maybe a little bit more on the folks that you're bringing into the company? And then I have one quick one for Jay to follow up. Thank you","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes, Bob. We had an organization that was \u2013 had international businesses all concentrated under one person. When this person retired was an opportunity for us to really take a look and say, I don't like to concentrate 60% of our business with very different profiles under just one person. So bringing Americas under Brik, very experienced leader with Baxter. And Cristiano Franzis who worked with me before, and Andy Frye, who comes from a large distributor in Asia, and before that Abbott, who give us a great execution lever to focus on those regions instead of just have one person looking at everything but the U.S. It's just a philosophy and a proven theory that I have that when you divide the world in the right regions, you have people focus on those regions, not only the top-line, but also the EPS per region.","The other, Sumant is a great technology and research and development leader, comes into the company with significant experience as we have ambitions to continue to grow our pharmaceutical business. Sumant brings a wealth of knowledge and experience into this area. And I think the Street's familiar with him, and he worked for Hospira before and then Pfizer. We are really excited about that.","And Giuseppe moving up to have a global role in terms of managing our product franchise in terms of innovation as well as upstream marketing, and working closely with our M&A group to make sure that we have the right inorganic opportunities in place, makes this team pretty strong.","On top of that, we brought Dennis Crowley who used to work for me before in M&A. Dennis really brings a strong background in acquisitions with him. There are a couple more team members that came to Baxter. So we're augmenting where we need. You never say you're finished. There is no finishing line when you manage a company. But we think today that we confidently have a strong team amongst our peers.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just to finish, Jay, previously in your LRP you gave specifics on 2018 and 2020 for top-line growth. And we've talked a lot about top-line growth here. But I'm just curious if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the cadence of operational revenue growth over the course of the LRP. And you've mentioned growing above 4% in 2020. Is there a more specific target for 2020 that you'd be willing to disclose here? And I guess just a question on cadence.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes, again, for us, the relevant number is the 4% over the period. As we approach the back part of this long-range plan horizon, you start to see the impact of innovation and annual rates ticking the 2020 rate is a little bit above the 4%.","And then as we look at 2018, there are a few different factors in play that impact that. You have the full \u2013 a annualization or some \u2013 a part of your benefit from Claris, but you also have an assumption around cyclo competition that we will be taking. And then also the impact of innovation in 2018 is not as great as it is in the latter part of this plan period. So a number of different factors. We'll stop short again today of giving annual revenue guidance because, again, there's a lot of puts and takes as we approach 2018.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I appreciate you taking the questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for taking my questions. Many have been answered already. Briefly, could you please give us an idea of how the cyclophosphamide competition you expect will be annualizing over the next couple of years? You briefly mentioned the impact in 2018, but you have a better line of sight on the competition than we do.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","By 2020, we have a fairly small cyclo business, so we expect this winding down very significantly from the current level to a 2020 number, and that occurs \u2013 starts to occur at the end of 2018 \u2013 or 2017 as a result of incremental competition on-boarding.","But I will tell you this is one that we have frankly been surprised by over the last several years. The level \u2013 the number of competitive entrants has been fewer than we originally modeled in 2015, than we modeled again in 2016. So it's best for us to keep watching this one.","We'll provide an update on cyclo guidance on our January earnings call certainly, and again as we approach the balance of this year in next quarter's call. But it's hard to say what's ultimately going to happen. What I can tell you is we have a fair amount of competition that's assumed by 2020 with a fairly de minimis business left in cyclo at that point.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's helpful \u2013 and that's my follow-up question. There's no doubt you have a lot of cash that you can deploy, and yet I feel like investors are waiting for you to do so. What does it take internally for you to pull that trigger? What kind of conversation does it \u2013 has to happen? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We have a lot of conversations. What it takes is to have the right strategic target. You've got to make sure that you are returning money to the shareholders. You can't just make an acquisition and think that internal rate of return of 7% is good enough. Maybe it's good enough for a few investors. For the majority of investors, that is below our long-term WACC, and that is not something that responsibly we will do.","We will select the right targets. We are doing it as we speak a significant amount of work. But I said to you, we're going to deliver value no matter what, either through acquisitions and as well to share buybacks. So I feel comfortable on both ends of the scale.","We didn't discard large acquisitions at all, we're just going now after everything that we can look at that makes sense for Baxter, okay. With a better team in place, we're looking at a much more agile process to get to our targets and as well as the amount of balance sheet capital that we have today, the ability to raise capital organically to get there, we will return money to the shareholders. So it's a win-win because we have two good avenues and we can do both at the same time.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wonderful. Thank you so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. Jay, I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on what's driving the operation \u2013 the increase in EPS guidance? How much of that is coming from FX in the back-half of the year versus Claris versus better operational performance? And then I have one follow-up.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. The prior guidance, the midpoint of the range was roughly $2.24, and as we think about the current midpoint, it moves to $2.37. There's a few drivers. The over-performance that we experienced in Q2 contributes roughly $0.07. The tax rate, improvements in tax is roughly $0.03. Cyclophosphamide is a couple of pennies of impact. FX is $0.01 and Claris is $0.01. So if you add those up, it's roughly $0.14 versus the midpoint of the last guidance range. About half of that speaks to the Q2 performance with the residual relating to other aspects of the business.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow up is on long-term perspective. Some of the higher profile pipeline products, specifically the on-demand PD products. Just wondering how you see products like that coming to play and driving that 4% CAGR through 2020. How do we think about the on-demand PD product for your Renal business? Is that something that takes penetration in your view from 12% to 14% in the U.S. today to some number significantly higher? Is it more a pricing play? How do we think about that impacting the Renal business and how much that contributes to your long-term guidance? Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","You're welcome. Our on demand product is on track. We see this as access to PD. We have modeled the penetration and how it's going to behave in the marketplace. I think it's a little too early for us to give you that information as we are starting our clinical trials next year. And we will be having this product on the market probably by 2020 once the clinical trial is finished.","The plans that I've seen, I've seen a rapid succession of improvements to the product which makes me very happy in terms of R&D. I feel that it continue to improve the product as it launches.","Our philosophy today versus the old one is we launch products faster with possibility of improvement as we go along to provide more value to the customer instead of getting and waiting for the optimal product with the most features to come out because what we find is highly featured products are not the way forward for an efficient health care system. So we want to make sure we have in the product what is needed and not what all the features that we could engineer and put into to the product. So we are confident that this product is going to do a few things for us. One is increase the penetration of PD for the ease-of-use. Not everybody will like to receive a pallet of product every month.","The second thing is it's a product that eventually can customize the solution concentration. This is not how we come out to the market with but it's eventual you can get there. Thirdly, is also a cost savings for the company in terms of the logistics costs and moving fluid around. But we're bettering that alongside our AMIA introduction which happened last year.","So what happens is a sequential of innovation for PD and our end objective is to make sure that as many patients that can receive PD are receiving PD in their homes. That is our main objective because we know the therapy is equally efficient as HD but also provide a better life experience for the patient who then can work during the day and to be productive during the day.","So we are little too early to give you the numbers. When we're ready, when we're close to the end of the clinical trial, we'll have more numbers in terms of penetration and how we're going to do this introduction. But we're very confident in talking to the FDA. The FDA is working with us, very interested as a matter of fact, how they can help move this technology forward. Thank you.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman","Thanks, Candace. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2019 financial results and our updated financial outlook for full-year 2019. A supplemental presentation to complement this morning's discussion can be accessed on our website. This presentation, along with related non-GAAP reconciliations, can also be accessed on Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events & News.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development, and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and is available on our website. On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth, which adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and generic competition for cyclophosphamide in the U.S.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Almeida","Good morning and thank you for joining us. We\u2019re pleased to share our second quarter results with you today and to discuss our updated expectations for 2019. I will begin with a quick review of our performance in the quarter and Jay will then provide more detail on the financials. We will wrap up with Q&A.","Baxter maintained a [responsive trajectory] in the second quarter of 2019 delivering sales growth of 4% on both a constant currency and operational basis. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $0.89 exceeding our expectations and up 16% year-over-year. Growth in the quarter was driven by top line sales performance, operational efficiency initiatives, a lower tax rate, and a reduced share count.","All six of our global business units contributed positively to constant currency sales growth, powered in-part by our revitalized innovation efforts. On a constant currency basis, global growth and the Renal Care continues to be driven by increasing patient volumes for our peritoneal dialysis products. As expected, results in the quarter were negatively impacted due to the strategic exit of the U.S. in-center hemodialysis Bloodline's business.","Performance was also impacted by a recall and certain manufacturing challenges at one of our facilities that produces Revaclear dialyzers used for hemodialysis. This is creating a temporary supply constraint as we have been selectively slowing down production lines at this facility to address this situation. However, Revaclear production is now ramping up and we expect to return to help their inventory levels over the next few months.","We do expect to incur incremental costs in the second half of the year as we work to enhance our production capabilities at this facility. I also wanted to take a moment to discuss the recent Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative announced by the White House earlier this month.","As proposed, it would have a transformative impact on the treatment of end-stage renal disease or ESRD in the U.S. This is part of an emerging trend taking shape in worldwide as payers, clinicians and patients increasingly embraced home PD as a frontline ESRD treatment option based on key economic therapeutic and lifestyle benefits.","Baxter is the pioneer in global market leader in the home PD and we fully support this initiative to broaden the adoption of home dialysis across the United States. As noted in our release this morning, we anticipate capital investments of $500 million to significantly increase our production capacity and meet new patients\u2019 needs in-line with proposed CMS models.","These investments will be scaled to align with the patient and market dynamics across the innovation curve, increased demand would in turn help accelerate Renal Care growth and contribute positively to Baxter\u2019s previously communicated financial estimates. We are working to model the anticipated impacts and expect to be in a better position to provide additional information about what this initiative means for Baxter once the role is potentially finalized it later this year.","Moving along our medication delivery business, returned to solid constant currency growth globally. We\u2019re now emerging from a challenging performance comparison to spike in demand for large volume IV solutions in the first half of 2018. Growth this quarter benefited from the continued uptake of our new infusion pumps, Spectrum IQ in the U.S., and Evo IQ in selected international markets and related disposables.","Increased sales for Mini-Bag Plus in the U.S. and Large Volume IV Solutions internationally also contributed to the growth in the quarter. Mid-single-digit constant currency growth in our pharmaceuticals business was driven by increased demand for Baxter\u2019s hospital pharmacy compounding services, the contribution from recent launches of injectable pharmaceuticals such as dexmed and the Baxter, a MetaBot business.","This trend helped offset the expected impact of generic competition in the U.S. for Brevibloc and [cyclophosphamide and] [indiscernible] benefit from new product launches, including the recent approval of approval of Myxredlin, the first and only ready-to-use insulin for IV infusion in a hospital or acute care setting.","Baxter's Clinical Nutrition business delivered low-single-digit sales growth globally on a constant currency basis. We\u2019re continuing to rebuild momentum here supporting in-part by the launch of new products, including [OLIMEL N11], higher protein formulation and FINOMEL, our novel fish oil-based triple-chamber container. We\u2019re also positioning for a U.S. launch of Clinolipid Baxter's proprietary olive oil-based lipid emulsion later this year. Advanced surgery delivered high-teens growth at constant currency rates. Performance in the quarter benefited from competitive supply constraints, which resulted in incremental demand for both FLOSEAL and RECOTHROM.","Finally, acute therapy has posted high-single-digit constant currency growth, fueled in-part by the ongoing rollout of our PrisMax next-generation technology for CRRT and Therapeutic Plasma Exchange. PrisMax can be found in the intensive care units in more than 20 countries across Europe and Asia-Pacific. There are plans to bring additional markets on board through 2020.","As all these highlights reflect, we\u2019re continuing to see Baxter's renewed emphasis on innovation, gaining traction, and delivering results across our businesses. There is a great promise and potential ahead, fueled by our research and development pipeline, and strong balance sheet, and emerging opportunities. Most importantly, our employees, who are inspired and empowered by our mission to save and sustain lives. Our transformation is on track and we remain absolutely focused on delivering sustainable top quartile performance in service of patients, shareholders, and the rest of our broad stakeholder base.","Now, I'll pass it on to Jay for a closer look at our financials and outlook.","Jay Saccaro","Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. As Joe mentioned, our second quarter results reflect solid constant currency growth across each of our six business units, and further reinforce confidence in our full-year outlook. I\u2019ll start by discussing our second quarter results before providing our updated financial outlook for 2019. Beginning with the second quarter, global sales of $2.8 billion were flat on a reported basis, and increased 4% on both a constant currency and operational basis, reflecting strength across our portfolio.","On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings increased 16% to $0.89 per diluted share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.80 to $0.82 per diluted share, driven by topline performance, ongoing operational efficiencies, and a lower tax rate.","Now, I\u2019ll walk you through performance by our geographic segments in global businesses. Note, for this quarter, constant currency sales growth is equal to operational sales growth for all businesses and region segments except for our pharmaceuticals business and the Americas region for which we will provide operational growth in addition to constant currency growth. ","Starting first with sales growth for our three geographic segments. Sales in the Americas grew 1% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally. Sales in EMEA grew 6% on a constant currency basis, and sales in our Asia-Pacific region advanced 9% on a constant currency basis.","Moving to performance by global businesses. Global sales for Renal Care were $910 million advancing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by high-single-digit growth in PD therapies globally, partially offsetting this growth was the lower sales of select in-center HD products including the Bloodline's business exited earlier this year, which negatively impacted sales in the quarter by approximately $14 million.","Renal Care sales growth in the quarter was also impacted by the recall and temporary supply constraints associated with the Revaclear dialyzer. The impact was less than $10 million in the quarter. Sales in medication delivery of $689 million grew 4% on a constant currency basis, representing a return to solid and balanced growth in both the U.S. and internationally. Performance in the quarter benefited from strength in infusion systems following the launch of Spectrum IQ and Evo IQ.","International growth of large volume IV Solutions, particularly in Latin America and the continued momentum from Mini-Bag Plus. We are pleased with the sequential and year-over-year growth acceleration in our medication delivery business. Pharmaceutical sales were $539 million increasing 4% constant currency and 7% operationally.","Strong international sales contributed to performance in the quarter, driven by the increased demand for our hospital pharmacy compounding services, generic injectables, including [Baxter MetaBot] and anesthesia products. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. business, which are reflected approximately $40 million of lower U.S. sales of Brevibloc and cyclo, as compared to the prior year period. Sales in the U.S. were also impacted by lower sales of anesthesia and critical care products in the quarter.","Moving to nutrition, total sales were $215 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis and reflect sequential improvement in both the U.S. and internationally. We expect sales to continue to ramp throughout 2019 as we worked to rebuild our U.S. business and capitalize on new product launches.","Sales of $232 million in advanced surgery increased 17% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth benefited from our ability to address competitive supply constraints in the hemostat market in the U.S. These supply dynamics contributed approximately 12 percentage points to growth in the quarter.","Sales in our acute therapies business were $133 million, representing growth of 8% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this business is now normalized, after a difficult year-over-year comparison in the first quarter, and we continue to see growth globally driven by new product launches and demand for Baxter's CRRT therapies.","Finally, sales in our other category, which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services were $122 million, a decrease of 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a challenging comparison to the prior year period.","Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 44.5% represents a 100-basis point decline compared to the prior year period as benefits from our manufacturing improvements and portfolio initiatives were more than offset by lower U.S. sales of Brevibloc and cyclo and a less favorable product mix.","In addition, gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental expenses related to enhancing manufacturing capabilities at our dialyzer facility. Adjusted SG&A totaled $610 million, decreasing 5% on a reported basis, and 1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the positive contributions from our targeted initiatives to improve operational efficiency. We continue to strategically invest in sales and marketing initiatives, while maintaining our focus on driving increased effectiveness in general and administrative expenses.","Adjusted R&D spend in the quarter of $141 million decreased 14% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year period. We continue to see benefit from our efforts to enhance our processes and optimize our R&D organization, while prioritizing strategic investment in our innovation pipeline. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 18%, an increase of 90 basis points versus the prior year.","Net interest expense totaled $20 million in the second quarter, an increase of $9 million, compared to the prior year, driven by lower interest income and increased interest expense resulting from higher average commercial paper borrowings during the quarter, and the issuance of our new 1.5 billion of Euro denominated debt. This debt was issued at an average coupon of 75 basis points, and an average duration of 7.5 years.","Further income totaled $28 million in the quarter, driven by pension benefits and foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions. The adjusted tax rate was 10.8% for the quarter, favorable to our expectations, primarily driven by a benefit resulting from a favorable tax ruling along with stock compensation deductions.","And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.89 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.80 to $0.82 per share. Within the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $123 million or 2 million shares of Baxter stock, which was partially offset by option-related dilution within the quarter.","With respect to cash flow, in the first half of 2019, free cash flow of $265 million was in-line with our expectations. In the second quarter, we drove sequential improvement in days inventory on hand and we continue to expect the cash conversion ramp in the second half of the year.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our guidance for the full-year 2019 and the third quarter. For the full-year 2019, we now expect reported growth of 1% to 2% globally and are approximately 4% sales growth on both a constant currency and operational basis.","Moving to full-year guidance by business on a constant currency basis except where otherwise noted. In Renal Care, we now expect growth of approximately 2%. Strong growth for our PD therapies globally is expected to be partially offset by lower sales in in-center HD, due to strategic exits in our U.S. Bloodline's business, which negatively impacted Renal Care sales in 2019 by approximately $55 million.","In addition, the impact of supply disruption from the Revaclear dialyzer is expected to negatively impact full-year sales by approximately $20 million. We expect to return to normal inventory level by the end of the year. In Medication Delivery, we continue to expect sales to increase approximately 6% with sequential improvement in the second half of the year.","For our pharmaceuticals business, we now expect an increase of low single digits on a constant currency basis. U.S. cyclo sales are now expected to total approximately $125 million versus our previous assumption of $105 million, adjusting for U.S. cyclo, operational growth is now expected to increase mid-single digits. As a reminder, Brevibloc sales are included in operational growth and are expected to decline approximately $75 million in 2019.","Moving to Clinical Nutrition, we continue to expect sales growth of approximately 3%. For our advanced surgery business, we now expect sales to increase high-single-digits given the strong performance year-to-date. Our guidance assumes that competitive supply constraints begin to ease in the third quarter. For the Acute Therapies business, we continue to expect growth of approximately 7% to 8%. Finally, in our other business, we continue to expect sales to decline low-to-mid single digits.","Moving down to P&L, we continue to anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points to 100 basis points with an additional savings in operational expenses being offset by the gross margin impact of mitigation efforts to return our dialyzer manufacturing plant to full capacity by year-end. The full-year estimate of these incremental expenses is expected to total approximately $50 million.","We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million, and we now expect adjusted other income of approximately $90 million for 2019. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 16%, reflecting the favorability from Q2. We continue to anticipate a full-year diluted average share count of approximately 520 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2019 adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $3.34 to $3.40 per diluted share.","Finally, for the year, we continue to expect to generate operating cash flow of $2.3 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion. Specific to the third quarter of 2019, we expect sales growth of 3% to 4% on a reported basis, and approximately 5% on both a constant and in operational basis. We expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.82 to $0.84 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Joe, I thought your comments on ESRD are pretty clear. So, maybe I\u2019ll focus on medication delivery and a quick one for Jay. Joe in Med Delivery, obviously you beat our number, there was a pretty significant momentum improvement, you are maintaining guidance. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re feeling about market stability, new customer, new account penetration, and in fact the pump business as we head into the second half of the year and then a quick one for Jay?","Joe Almeida","Good morning, David. The business as we had predicted had a really tough comp in the first quarter, but we had confidence in our ability to secure current customers that have been with us for many years. So, we have re-signed all GPO agreements and for the most part we have signed a great deal of [IDM agreements] as well. The market is stable. We found opportunities to gain new customers, not only in the acute care market, but also in the OEM or contract manufacturing business that is important to us, help us in our facilities, but also improve the visibility of Baxter product line across all sets of care.","When it comes to pumps, we have a very healthy pipeline. There is always pluses and minuses, but I would say at the moment the pluses are winning free handily, the opportunities that we have. But I\u2019d tell you the new management group that we have put in the U.S. has done an extraordinary job in understanding the pipeline and the creation of value. Our spectrum version 9 is a wonderful pump; it\u2019s a really good device with the number one best in-class drug library. And that has been very important to us in terms of having this product showcased for our customers.","So, the business as we predicted is healthy. We\u2019re going to continue to make progress and this continues to be our source of investment for ourselves. Our new pump platform is coming along extremely well and we\u2019re very comfortable with the launch time line for it.","David Lewis","Okay, very clear. And then Jay, just thinking about a couple of items in the guidance in the back half of the year, I mean FLOSEAL was a benefit; to this particular quarter, I\u2019m sort of curious, what your assumptions were for the back half of the year for FLOSEAL? And then with Myxredlin, maybe just talk little briefly about the size of the opportunity there for the company. I think we\u2019ve talked about this product launch for a while. How big is that opportunity and what are the assumptions into the back half? Thanks so much.","Jay Saccaro","Sure. With respect to our biosurgery business, yes, we did comment on some upside that we experienced in the second quarter. We don\u2019t like to forecast competitor outages, so we don\u2019t maintain long-term assumptions on that. However, if we have very clear visibility to a short-term situation emerging, we will reflect that in our guidance. So, as we think about advanced surgery, there is roughly two months of upside that we\u2019re counting on in our numbers as we sit here today. So, we\u2019ll expect that to continue for a couple of months. If it continues further than that, of course, we will be available to supply our customers, but we\u2019re not counting on anything more than that. ","We\u2019ve talked previously about how exciting the insulin-Myxredlin launch is. It\u2019s a new presentation of our workforce product for hospitals absolutely thrilled, the size of the market is significant, it\u2019s over a $100 million market, I mean hospitals in the U.S. So, this represents a very viable long-term opportunity for us. As it relates to this year\u2019s guidance, we have single digit millions built-in basically nothing built into our guidance at this point. In large part, we want to be cautious in terms of launch timing, preparing, and having adequate supply available when we actually go to market. So, no meaningful impact this year, but stay tuned as we give guidance for 2020. This will have a more meaningful impact in those numbers.","David Lewis","Thanks so much, nice quarter.","Jay Saccaro","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes for Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robbie Marcus","Great, and gain congrats on a nice quarter here. Jay, two questions for you. First, maybe we could start on the [P&L performance], really impressive how you were able to offset some of the lower gross margin product strength in the quarter with lower R&D and SG&A, but with R&D taking such a hit and SG&A coming down so rapidly, maybe you could just give us some insight into where that\u2019s coming from, is it more a general efficiency in overhead or you holding back on some projects for the future?","Jay Saccaro","Sure. Just with respect to gross margins, to your comment, gross margin did come in a little bit below our expectations. Really, there were just a few drives of that. Some of it related to business mix as you pointed out. We had very strong performance in our drug compounding business, but that carries a much lower margin in the corporate average. Now interestingly enough about this business, it is a very high return on invested capital business for us, but the gross margin is lower. So, the fact we overachieved that business cost us about 30 basis points to our gross margin, and then addressing some of the dialyzer manufacturing issues, that\u2019s roughly a 20-basis point impact in the quarter.","So, those were two of the more prominent items impacting gross margin for us. Of course, there were always other bits and bytes, but we were able to offset that with continued focus on spending. So, on the SG&A side, we are very focused on improving the efficiency of our back-office operations along with judiciously spending every single dollar. So, we\u2019ve talked in the past about the zero-based spending approach that we have here disciplined around all spending categories along with really thinking creatively about how we organize the back office. That continues to pay dividends today, paying dividends in the quarter, you saw a decline of SG&A of 1%, and again this is on the back of three or four years of continued improvements in this particular area. So, a great performance on the SG&A line.","R&D is a little bit different. Some of this relates to timing, some of it relates to the fact that we\u2019ve been able to get after some of the infrastructure cost in R&D faster than accelerations in certain areas and new product spending. And so, we will see some R&D tickup in the second half of the year. What I will tell you is, our overarching principle on R&D is, we want to invest to grow and we are funding programs for success, we are not holding back on any dollars. And I think the press release, Joe\u2019s comments about this spirit of innovation at the company is evident of that philosophy in action. Having said that, we did see savings in this particular area, so stay tuned to the back half. Joe, you want to add to that?","Joe Almeida ","Yes, sure. Robbie, the whole thing about R&D was for us to create efficiency in the R&D line and the spending has not been very different than if you go back to 2016; it\u2019s just a mix, where are we spending and how we are spending the money? So, we abandon large programs that had absolutely no return investment and we invest in significant opportunities in areas of medication delivery, acute Renal Care with our point of care in PD, as well as have some very quick turnaround new products in advanced surgery, some in the nutrition area. So, if you think about, we also have significant arbitrage in labor, because we created centers of excellence across the globe, but also, now we have a very large center in Bangalore, India we never had. So, it is well managed group.","Our heads of R&D, led by our GPO leaders and Sumant Ramachandra who has overarching responsibility for the function have been very successful in reallocation of cost. I want to just tell investors, that we\u2019re very focused in innovation and that fluctuation in spending is nothing other than being efficient and timings of the investments, nothing to do with us going and tightening the belt in R&D programs.","Robbie Marcus","Very clear, and if I could sneak one more in. Just on capital deployment, not surprised that we haven\u2019t seen any M&A here with MedTech valuations where they are, but how are you balancing your capital allocation plans here with Baxter share price at highs and MedTech valuations where they are? Thanks.","Jay Saccaro","Robbie, it has been a very, very busy first half analyzing opportunities. The way we have allocated capital inorganically is not very different than how we allocate organically. We do have focus in area of monitoring in the areas of acute Renal Care and critical care. We also are very focused in looking at individual molecules. So, what I\u2019m going to say to our investors is, think about Baxter adding value with the small tuck-ins as we look for the right opportunity and valuation for a larger deal. It is very, very rich, right now the market is frothy and we are not going to compromise on the returns of this acquisition.","Every acquisition has, they larger they get, the inherent risk is enormous and we all understand that, we all take risk, but there is a point where the cost of investing in that asset and the price valuations are so [out of whack] that you cannot make internal rate of return of low single digits, it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work. And then if anything goes wrong, the FDA comes about and tells that a product that you have has a compound that is made into the product that doesn\u2019t work, now your whole evaluation of that target is under scrutiny, you\u2019ve got to be very careful with this and understand your target.","I think Baxter is surprising to our investors. How much opportunity there was and there is and there will be in our base businesses and how we have the opportunity to innovate and continue to maintain number one position in most of our businesses and watch us in the pump business, watch us there because we are coming out with a great platform of pumps and monitoring devices. So, the thing is, let add to those inorganically as tuck-ins, let\u2019s not think about all the time this huge capital investment in allocation into assets that are overly expensive. And I tell you something else, we will continue to acquire our shares prudently, while we see the prices are there, because we are not going to sit on cash as I said to you, cash is not going to burn a hole in our pocket.","Robbie Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you and good morning.","Joe Almeida","Good morning.","Bob Hopkins","Wanted to start with a big picture question, Joe, obviously you put up a very solid Q2, sounds like the pipeline is making good progress, obviously also during the quarter you got some nice new, sort of structural tailwinds in some of your business. As you kind of think about all these factors and put them together, do they sort of suggest some upward pressure to your long-range plan from a revenue growth perspective or are they just nice offsets to other headwinds? Just trying to get a sense for the sort of cumulative effect of all these things that are going on right now.","Joe Almeida","Well, if you think about our long-range plan, when you give a five-year plan, you always going to have put and takes and how you are going to make things happen, okay. You have the best intentions in the world, you have the best plans in the world, not everything works same way on the positive side or negative side. For instance, we didn\u2019t plan to have our insulin product premixed approved as early as we did, we planned actually to have that approval towards the end of the year. That\u2019s a plus for us, but other things worked the other way as well. So, when I look at the major forces that we have going on right now, you have a tremendous momentum in our peritoneal dialysis business. So, you know, just in terms of patient growth, we are experiencing a healthy growth in terms of patient. ","We don\u2019t even have the executive order from the White House coming in and becoming a rule and there will be a transformation for the renal business, but just that, we experienced high-single-digit growth in patients in PD. So, that has an effect to our plan to offset many, many negatives that can appear in the future. So, I figured this moment that between everything that is happening in the market and the things that happened in Baxter that we can sit here and say well, we told you last year, we reconfirmed today, okay.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. That sounds fair. But maybe as my second question, I\u2019ll just ask a follow-up to that. I understand the philosophy, but it does seem like there is your philosophy in providing your guidance, but it does seem like, since you gave that guidance, most of the incremental news flow that you have been getting to your business is positives. I mean, I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything. When we think long-term are there other negatives that have popped up that would make you hesitant on this issue, relative to some of these very incrementally positive pieces of news that you\u2019ve gotten over the course of the last couple of months.","Jay Saccaro","Remember the last time we gave guidance, the dynamic in the Medication Delivery business shifted quite a bit, and we\u2019ve been able to reconfirm our long-term expectations despite that shift as a result of strength in many different areas in the portfolio and general buoyancy of the new product pipeline along with great product progress in areas like PD and successful adoption there. So, I think it\u2019s too early to start changing LRP\u2019s at this point. We will consider doing that at some point in the future, but on balance we were very pleased with the quarter. We were pleased with the signs of operational strength along with some of the longer-term good pieces of news that we\u2019ve been able to either de-risk or add to the story.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Market. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning everybody and very nice quarter. I want to spend a couple more minutes on the renal business and this is sort of a two-part question. The first part is, you\u2019ve been sort of huddling a headwind as you\u2019ve exited the in-center HD business, at what stage does that annualize, we don\u2019t see that anymore? And then the second part is, your 500 million investment, can you just parse that a little bit, what do you think the benefit will be? And then I would assume there is some level of pressure on gross margins, how we can think about that over time? Thank you.","Jay Saccaro","Sure. I\u2019ll make the comments on the Bloodlines and then Joe maybe you can comment on the excitement around the investment. With respect to the bloodlines, that\u2019s just one component of HD business in the U.S. We do have other as product that we sell in the U.S., but that particular one was a product that we distributed and it was a very low margin business. It was a $55 million impact roughly for this year, and by the end of this year we will be done and it will be ceased to be a headwind the end of this year. As we related to the investment, Joe, you want to make some comments about that?","Joe Almeida","Sure. We have to the best of our ability scoped our project. Based on the interpretation of the executive order that we have, okay. And that is not final rule yet, and the comments will be complete in about 50 days, and after that the HHS has time to put the rule in place. So, based on what we know and interpreted from the executive order, we have a three-phase investment here. We have an investment where we can supply the market with the growth studies projected in the beginning, because this is the progress, remember this addresses the best market about 50% of the overall served market and then from that 50% there is a ramp, there is a period where clinics are given an opportunity to change their patterns between clinic, hemodialysis, and home therapy.","So, based on that we can accommodate with some supply chain that we did extremely well about a year-and-a-half ago by relocating and reregistering products from all over the Americas so we can do that. Then there is a second phase where we do a small investment, more modest than \u2013 part of the 500, they give us incremental capacity all the way [indiscernible] starting to invest into a new plant. The investment will be, depends upon the time, sometimes concurrently done, but the effect of the throughput will be felt later \u2013 in later years. Remember, this is a seven-year program. So, we feel, as company, our responsibility, moral responsibility to our customers and more so to the patients is to be there for this opportunity. So, we\u2019re going to make everything possible to not be a problem during the ramp up that is so aggressively laid out in the executive order.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you.","Joe Almeida","Thanks, Joanne.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar ","Congrats on the nice piece here, Joe and Jay. Jay, maybe on the 3Q EPS, if I just look at the OpEx rate, the last two years, EPS has grown sequentially, revenues are accelerating in the back half, sequentially I'm not sure why EPS would be down because it looks like the dialyzer impact on gross margins was felt in 2Q, so maybe can you just walk through that EPS math and maybe some timing element on expense here, which would be impacting 3Q?","Jay Saccaro","Sure. As we look at the Q2 to Q3 story, there are a couple of factors to keep in mind. One is the dialyzers impacted us about $0.01 in Q2, but as we moved to Q3, that will ramp up a little bit somewhere between $0.02 and $0.03 of impact. The second prominent driver relates to tax rate. We\u2019ll see a really substantial uptick in tax from Q2 to Q3, that\u2019s somewhere around $0.08 or $0.09. So, it really does match some of the strong operational performance. ","Now, I have to say hats off to the tax team for great work in terms of optimizing the tax rate and allowing us to capitalize on opportunities that emerge and really think about how we organize our operations effectively in a tax efficient manner. So, we saw a benefit in Q1 and Q2, but we don\u2019t expect to see that in Q3 and Q4 to the same extent. So, the tax rate in the third and fourth quarter kicks up to roughly [19-ish percent] from the [12-ish percent] that we\u2019ve had year-to-date. So, that\u2019s really the \u2013 those are some of the primary drivers. We\u2019ll see continued operational strength that helps support and offset those items, but that really is the big \u2013 those are the big drivers as we move from Q2 to Q3.","Vijay Kumar ","That\u2019s really helpful, Jay. And one quick \u2013 on Pharma, I mean Brevibloc was about 700 basis points to 800 basis points impact to revenues first half and despite that you guys did a phenomenal in Pharma rates. And as those headwinds go away in the back half, I'm just curious why, you know, perhaps Pharma couldn\u2019t come in better?","Joe Almeida","As we look at the pharmaceuticals business to your point, we\u2019ve had a very solid performance in the first half of the year, and a lot of that was driven by great performance in our compounding business outside the U.S. We do expect that \u2013 and that business grew in the first half of the year in 20%, very significant. As we move to Q3 and Q4, we don't expect to see that level of accelerated performance in the back half, so that really is the primary driver that takes the former growth rate down.","But I will tell you, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance in this area. It's been a great source of over achievement for us and steady growth and, you know, with things like Myxredlin on the horizon, which will benefit future years, along with some of the premixed injectables and the Claris portfolio, which has been selling well here in the U.S. Overall, you know, this has been a very solid performer for us.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, guys.","Jay Saccaro","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on infusion system and one on Asia-Pacific, so Joe, one of your competitors have had some issues with their pump and infusion sets, do you see an opportunity for Baxter to take some share here? And with a new pump platform coming out in 2020, are customers extending the selling cycle to wait for the new platform? And I have one follow-up.","Joe Almeida","Larry, the opportunities that we\u2019re having are mostly, mostly related to the strength of our version 9 of our pump. Its operability, it\u2019s our drug library, so we have customers who have been our customers for a long time and start with them to renew their like \u2013 innovation and evolution of the product and they just buy it. There's always opportunity when there is a problem with a competitor in the market. If that problem is perceived to be more permanent than temporary, so we need to think about, as we look at our Advanced Surgery business, that is going to be a \u2013 probably a temporary gain until the competitor comes back on the market, and because our product is so good, the FLOSEAL is the best product on the market.","There is opportunity to retake ups, right? So, the same applies for the infusion pumps. You know it depends upon how permanent, how temporary the issue is that competitors are having. But I think the success that we\u2019ve been having is, first of all, a very good sales effort, new team completely focused on pipeline, second is the ability to demonstrate the technical superiority of our drug library, compared to the competitors. To your point on the new platform, no, there are customers who need the product now, they will take the product now. ","I just want to let you know that LVP, which is a large volume parenterals pump, which is what we have to-date, remember we don't have any other pump, that\u2019s what we have today, the guts of the new pump, all are different, are more modern and will be a horizontal pump. But, but work flow, the drug library, all the features are the same, meaning you have a new product with phenomenal operability, but also has a great pumping mechanism in the new pump platform. We have a great pump mechanism today, Version 9, and the operability is the sane, so the customers have a lot to gain Baxter launches the other pumps, which are part of the same family, with the same interoperability.","So, it will be a new platform on the market that has that capability and I think that customers can see that going forward. If they need the pump now, there\u2019s nothing that they are losing on this current version versus the new platform for the large volume parenterals, but what we will bring into the market is not only syringe \u2013 patient, patient-controlled [indiscernible] PCA as well as in 12 months from the launch of their first one is ambulatory. So, I hope this answers the answer to your question and put our investor at easy that there is no business being postponed because we don't have the NTP today.","Lawrence Biegelsen ","Very helpful, Joe. And just lastly, Asia-Pacific has been very strong. What\u2019s driving that and how sustainable is that? Thanks for taking the questions.","Jay Saccaro ","Great. We\u2019re really pleased with the performance in the Asia-Pacific region, 9% growth coming \u2013 it was really strength across the board. You know we\u2019ve grown a custom to solid performance coming from China in the quarter, you know, 7% plus growth from that particular business. But what perhaps has been more surprising based on historical commentary from Baxter is the fact that we had a tremendous performance in Japan, high single-digit growth coming from our Japanese business, and it\u2019s really a combination of factors in play.","Looking at the other areas, you know, solid performance in Southeast Asia, we\u2019ve had a great business in Australia and New Zealand for the med. We\u2019ve been there for many, many years, double-digit growth there, a lot of that benefiting from compounding. But what I will tell you is this is a combination of commercial execution along with the benefits of new product launches. We\u2019ve talked quite a bit about the impact of Kaguya. We are seeing continued momentum in patient gains in Japan and this is, you know that\u2019s a great driver for us. But I think across the region, there is examples of innovation, but like I said, commercial excellence that have really contributed to this performance. On a full-year basis, we\u2019ll expect this to come down a little bit from a growth rate standpoint, but not materially. So, overall, you know, great performance from the team in Asia.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Kristen Stewart ","Hi, and thanks so much for the question and congrats on a good quarter. I was wondering if you could just provide us with an update on the Pharmaceutical business and some of the legacy Claris manufacturing, FDA warning letters, how you\u2019re feeling about that, and how there maybe opportunities to deal with that? Thanks.","Joe Almeida","Hi, good morning. Our Pharmaceutical business is \u2013 our strategy is starting to take shape. It took a little bit. We have built a second-to-none formulation team between India and Northern Illinois, very talented vis-a-vis now our partnership to launch the insulin product, that's Med, and this is just the beginning of our very long pipeline. When it comes to Claris, or what we call [Baxter Metabot] we are doing everything that we have spoken to the FDA and have told the FDA we\u2019re going to do. It\u2019s up to the FDA to lift or to inspect us again, and provide us with their feedback, okay. But nevertheless, we are de-risking any Claris opportunity for future by having ultimate supplies for almost everything that we make there. And also, for the future molecules, we are de-risking that by going to CMOs instead and having Claris possibly as a backup in the future.","There is one molecule that I won\u2019t read \u2013 speak about, the name of the molecule, but that molecule we're developing in [Metabot], but also, we\u2019re going to have a pilot operation in our Illinois facilities, so we can have possibly a backup. This is more of a longer term. So, we\u2019re doing not only everything that we told the FDA we\u2019re going to do remediate the one letter that was given to us the day that we bought the company, but also, we are doing everything we can to de-risk any future revenue stream. Now, the performance of the business is doing very well, its double-digit growth. That business is resilient, is doing well and is not only U.S., but is also in Europe, that is doing well. So, this is the state of our Pharmaceutical business.","Kristen Stewart","And just as a follow-up, do you still anticipate that you may be able to move beyond the warning letter issues next year, I think that's what you\u2019ve said before, and do some of the actions that you're taking, what will be kind of the P&L impact of that? Could that put a little bit more pressure on the margin side for 2020? Thanks.","Joe Almeida","We have done a couple of things. We accelerated the development and placed the molecules from the future that we think in any case we\u2019ll be able to offset any negatives that will come out of a potential and I cannot actually rate likely or unlikely because I\u2019m not the FDA. So right now, our plans are for 2021. If it happens, if we get the clearance and can commercialize products that are new on [file] from the plant, it will be great. We\u2019ll follow our plan. If that has any postponement for whatever reason, we have backup plans that will probably not alter the trajectory of that business.","Kristen Stewart","Thank you very much.","Joe Almeida ","So, there is upside is that happens, if we are successful in 2021.","Clare Trachtman","Candace, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Taylor ","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on a couple things in the renal business. So, I guess first, Joe or Jay, you\u2019re talking about the investments that you\u2019re planning, you know, according to the model that could come out. I guess I was wondering if you could share with us some insight into those plans in terms of the scale that you are currently planning for, meaning if you do invest that $500 million. Could you help us understand what number of additional patients or dollars that would allow you to address? And just give us a little more of the roadmap?","Joe Almeida","Matt, you think about this. If you read the executive order, is the significant amount of interpretations and things that buried in and that's why they have the comment and that\u2019s why the rule is not there yet. But think about this today, we are 12% penetrated in PD in the United States. Remember this is our home, there\u2019s three pillars to it. Two of them are interconnected, which is a transplantation process and number of available kidneys to be transplanted with a lot of incentives not only \u2013 in terms of healthcare insurance for donors and things like that all way to moving from the clinic to the home, two different modalities from human dialysis and PD. Baxter is a leader with close to 70% of the market share in PD on a global basis in U.S. around the same number, okay.","So, if its 12% in the U.S. and there's a 50% population that is being targeted for demonstrating, if you look at the targets of the government, it\u2019s not inconceivable to think about double patients just in the period of demonstration within the seven years of the demonstration period. So, it tells you that you would double the incident patients, not the prevalent, but the incident patients going forward. That\u2019s how we have done some of our analysis, but our plans are flexible, so we can flex up the investment if we need to or flex down the investment because it\u2019s progressive. ","There is Phase 1 with no investment, Phase 2 with some investment, Phase 3, which is to build a new plant, all of them will launch very similarly in time because they have different lead times for execution. But those are designed to support the program as it was designed, but as I said to you, if this rule comes out in November, we will have the ability to adjust our plans, but right now, we want to ensure that the government knows, our investor knows, our patients and customer know that we are committed to the program and we\u2019ll do everything possible to help patients get the therapy that they deserve and for us as a company to grow in this sector, which is so important and has been so underestimated and underpenetrated for so many years, not only in the US, but across the globe.","Matt Taylor ","Thank you. If I could just sneak in one follow-up, you mentioned that lot of the data you presented on Theranova and I was wondering if you have any updated thoughts about giving some differential reimbursement for that product?","Joe Almeida","Well, we are here waiting for decision from \u2013 actually not from HHS, but probably from between the HHS and the scoring process that happens at the budget office. So, we know as much as you do, but we are excited about the possibility and we have several different avenues to get Theranova in the U.S. Most importantly, we have agreed with the FDA on the novel process and this challenge that we have at our plant in the US will be timely resolved, and the plant \u2013 one of the issues that we had with the plant, we tried to ramp up the plat too fast because our dialysis volume went up between two different forecast, and when we tried to do the ramp up, we encountered some issues because the plant was underutilized at that moment. But with this, no, not all bad, few things good come out of it, and one of them is that we\u2019re going to be fully staffed and equipped on our order lines plant in Opelika to be able to have the ability to produce Theranova when it\u2019s needed.","Matt Taylor","Thank you very much.","Joe Almeida ","Thanks, Matt.","Jay Saccaro ","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference with Baxter International. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for calling in. As you saw in the press release that was issued earlier this morning, Baxter's first quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we've also confirmed guidance for the full year for 2013.","In the first quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $1.05 per diluted share and worldwide sales increased 2%. And our financial outlook for the full year includes sales growth of approximately 10%, which reflects the impact of the Gambro acquisition, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.60 to $4.70.","Even in the face of a very challenging macro environment, Baxter continued to make investments to support geographic expansion initiatives and new product introductions while advancing a number of programs and improve the quality of care and address key high potential areas of unmet medical need. A few recent achievements include the advancement of our Home Hemodialysis Device, VIVIA. As you know, last year, we completed the first clinical trial in the U.S. evaluating the performance and safety of this new device, and we've initiated a second in-center nocturnal hemodialysis trial in Canada. We remain on track to complete this trial in the second quarter, which will be used to support CE Marking in Europe later this year.","Within our leading hemophilia franchise, we've achieved a number of milestones including the initiation of a global Phase III clinical trial of BAX 817, a recombinant factor VIIa therapy for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors, and we also announced results from a pivotal Phase III study evaluating routine prophylaxis of FEIBA compared to on-demand treatment of patients with hemophilia A or B and inhibitors. The presence of an inhibitor, as you know, makes response to treatment more challenging, and patients with inhibitors have an increased risk of developing complications such as joint damage. Top line results from this study showed a 72.5% reduction in the median annual bleed rate with prophylaxis treatment. This Phase III study supported the filing of a Biologics License Application with the FDA during the first quarter, and earlier this week Baxter was granted orphan drug designation for the prophylaxis indication.","Also within the hemophilia franchise, Baxter began dosing the first patients in the Phase III trial of BAX 855, a longer-acting PEGylated factor VIII therapy, based on the full-length ADVATE molecule with an increased half-life. With efficacy and safety as the primary goals for selecting the therapy, BAX 855 retains the underlying attributes of ADVATE, potentially offering alternative treatment regimen resulting in fewer infusions.","In the BioTherapeutics franchise, Baxter and our partner, Halozyme Therapeutics, announced the positive opinion in Europe for the use of HyQvia as a replacement therapy for adult patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. HyQvia is a combination of human normal immunoglobulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase which facilitates the dispersion and absorption of the therapy. Upon receiving marketing authorization from the European Commission, Baxter plans to launch HyQvia in select European markets later this year.","We also continue to advance development of GAMMAGARD LIQUID as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease. As you know, we completed the first Phase III study for Alzheimer's in December, recently locked the database and expect to release top line results during the second quarter. A second Phase III trial was initiated in the first quarter of 2012 and we've now randomized more than 200 of the estimated 400 patients, and we expect to complete this study in 2015.","On the business development front, we acquired the investigational hemophilia compound OBI-1 from Inspiration BioPharmaceuticals and related assets, including manufacturing operations from Ipsen Pharma. OBI-1 is a recombinant porcine factor VIII currently in Phase III clinical studies for the treatment of bleeding in people with acquired hemophilia, a rare potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder, which unlike congenital hemophilia, typically affects older adults and occurs equally in both males and females. OBI-1 received orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe and was recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA for this indication. OBI-1 has the potential to address existing unmet needs for hemophilia patients and, over time, represents a $200 million dollar opportunity for the company.","And finally, we received U.S. regulatory clearance for our proposed acquisition of Gambro AB, a global innovator in hemodialysis and acute renal technologies. This acquisition enhances Baxter's competitive position by creating a global renal therapies business with a comprehensive product offering for both chronic and acute dialysis patients and positions the company to capitalize on the significant opportunity presented by the large and growing global dialysis products market. Pending additional regulatory approvals, we continue to expect the transaction to close at the end of the second quarter.","In closing, Baxter's portfolio remains strong and we continue to benefit from our focus on life-saving therapies. In 2013 and beyond, we'll focus on the 4 growth vectors that support our strategic objectives and enable us to serve the interest of patients, providers and other key stakeholders. These 4 vectors include: enhancing growth by optimizing our core business portfolio; advancing the company's new product pipeline; capitalizing on the opportunity to develop new product models, which include public and private partnerships; and pursuing business development initiatives that deliver enhanced returns in the near- and long-term.","With this in mind, Baxter will fulfill our mission of improving quality and access to care as we save and sustain lives globally. And as always, I'd be happy to address any questions that you might have on these or other topics during the Q&A. So with that, I'd like to ask Bob to review our financial results for the quarter and also guidance for 2013. Bob, if you would?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the first quarter, excluding special items, increased 4% to $1.05 per diluted share, which is at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.03 to $1.05 per diluted share. As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP results include after-tax special items of $29 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The special items in the quarter were primarily associated with deal-related costs for the planned acquisition of Gambro AB.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the quarter before turning to our financial outlook for full year 2013. Starting with sales, worldwide sales of more than $3.4 billion in the first quarter increased 2% on both the reported and constant currency basis. Growth was driven primarily by acceleration in emerging markets, particularly BRIC countries, and solid performance in several key franchises within BioScience, which offset softness in the U.S. Medical Products business. In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales of $1.5 billion advanced 5% on both the reported and constant currency basis in the first quarter. Within the product categories, hemophilia sales of $765 million increased 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis. U.S. sales growth was strong as sales advanced 7% driven by double-digit growth of ADVATE and FEIBA. This more than offset the impact of European austerity measures and international tenders. We continue to be pleased with the benefits associated with our differentiated label of ADVATE as we continue to drive conversion from plasma-derived therapies and competitive offerings and enhanced penetration of prophylactic treatment.","In BioTherapeutics, sales of $509 million increased 2% on both the reported and constant currency basis. As expected, sales growth of GAMMAGARD LIQUID and albumin was in low single-digits, driven primarily by improved pricing as we remain capacity-constrained, while sales of Alpha-1 treatments continued to -- continued strong growth. In the first quarter, sales in BioSurgery of $172 million increased 12%. After adjusting for foreign currency, sales rose 11% driven by growth of TISSEEL and the benefit from the Synovis acquisition of approximately $10 million. Finally, vaccine revenues totaled $84 million in the quarter and increased 25%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 28%, driven primarily by strong demand from the FSME vaccine and the incremental milestone payments totaling approximately $10 million related to our ongoing collaborations on the development of influenza vaccines.","In Medical Products, global sales in the first quarter exceeded $1.9 billion and were comparable to the prior year. Excluding foreign currency, sales declined 1%. Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $590 million and were flat to the prior year while on a constant currency basis, sales were up 1%. Sales in this category were impacted by austerity measures implemented in China, the timing of tenders and lower HD sales, which offset the contribution from patient gains in the U.S. and emerging markets. Sales in the fluid systems category of $740 million increased 3% and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 2%.","Performance continues to be driven by solid demand for IV solutions and price improvements for certain injectable drugs like cyclophosphamide, which collectively offset lower sales of infusion pumps and access sets as planned.","Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $363 million, reflecting a decline of 1% on a reported basis and a 2% decline on a constant currency basis. Double-digit growth of anesthetics across international markets were driven by increased penetration in new markets, which was more than offset by lower sales in the U.S. attributed to softness in surgical procedures and fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of U.S. wholesalers.","Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $225 million, representing a 10% decline on a reported basis and 11% decline on a constant currency basis. This was due to temporary constraints, which resulted in delayed shipments to customers which have been resolved, and shipments have resumed.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter of 51.0% reflects margin expansion of 20 basis points versus the prior year margin of 50.8%. This was a result of underlying operational expansion driven primarily by the benefit of positive mix, which offset a number of headwinds including incremental pension expense, the medical device tax, government austerity measures and approximately $20 million of accelerated costs. SG&A totaled $778 million and increased to 5%, driven by the impact of incremental pension expense, investments we are making in promotional and marketing initiatives and within international markets to enhance our global presence. In total, these items more than offset the benefit from tight management of discretionary spending and operational efficiencies derived from our process reengineering efforts. R&D spending in the quarter increased 4% and totaled $246 million reflecting the progress we are making in advancing a number of programs in our pipeline, including those in our leading hemophilia franchise, Alzheimer's and other key programs.","The operating margin in the quarter was 21.3%. Interest expense was $25 million compared to $18 million last year. This increase is due to incremental expense associated with the debt issuance last year and lower interest income. Other income totaled $30 million in the quarter and is primarily attributable to the favorable foreign exchange impact on balance sheet positions and a gain of $10 million associated with the sale of intangible assets. The tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter, in line with expectations, and includes a modest benefit from the 2012 R&D tax credit. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.05 increased 4%.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter totaled $386 million and capital expenditures totaled $292 million, both in line with our expectations. DSO ended the quarter at 53.6 days reflecting a 4-day improvement versus the same period last year due to a significant reduction in DSOs in certain international markets.","Inventory turns of 2.2 turns are modestly lower than the first quarter last year. As you know, we continue to increase inventory level to support growing demand, particularly for plasma proteins, as we remain on track to benefit from enhanced capacity in the second half of the year.","Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $534 million or, on a net basis, 4 million shares for $351 million, in line with our full year objective.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the full year 2013. As you saw in the press release, we confirmed guidance and continue to expect earnings of $4.60 to $4.70 per diluted share. This includes the impact of the Gambro acquisition, which is projected to close at the end of the second quarter, with estimated dilution of $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share. This dilution is primarily related to non-cash amortization of intangible assets which will be finalized upon closing.","By line item of the P&L and starting with sales, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 10%, and this includes a half-year sales contribution from Gambro of approximately $830 million. Excluding Gambro, we continue to expect sales growth on a constant currency basis of approximately 4%, and at current foreign exchange rates, we expect a modest negative impact on sales for the year.","For the full year, given current foreign exchange rates, we now expect gross margin for the company to be approximately 50.5% for the full year. While year-over-year, we expect margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points in the base Baxter business, this will be more than offset by intangible asset amortization related to Gambro; incremental pension expense; government austerity measures, including medical device tax; and a negative impact from foreign currency.","In terms of expense, we expect SG&A to increase approximately 10% and R&D to grow in mid single-digits, with both line items reflecting leverage in the Baxter business at Baxter expense base along with the addition of Gambro. We continue to expect interest expense to total approximately $170 million which reflects the impact of the debt issuance associated with the Gambro acquisition. In addition, we now expect other income to total approximately $10 million for the full year. We expect a tax rate of approximately 22% and we expect the full year average share count of approximately 550 million shares which assumes approximately $300 million to $400 million in net share repurchases. From a cash flow perspective, our plan remains to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.3 billion with capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.7 billion which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.","Let me move to sales and expand our assumptions for the 2 businesses and the major product categories. Beginning with Medical Products, on a constant currency basis including the half-year contribution related to Gambro, we expect sales growth in the low teens. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 3% to 4%. Specifically, we expect Baxter renal sales to grow in low single-digits, which will be augmented by a half-year sales contribution from Gambro totaling approximately $830 million. We continue to expect fluid systems sales, which includes IV solutions infusion pumps and access sets, to grow in mid single-digits. We expect Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in low single-digits. And we expect the BioPharma Solutions business to have comparable sales to 2012 of approximately $1 billion.","For BioScience, we continue to project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, in the 4% to 5% range. Our outlook includes low to mid single-digit growth in our hemophilia franchise, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived factor VIII and factor IX therapies and FEIBA, an inhibitor treatment. We expect mid to high single-digit growth in BioTherapeutics driven primarily by strong demand for immunoglobulin therapies, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID and subcu therapies, as well as growth in albumin and our treatments for Alpha-1 deficiency. In BioSurgery, we expect high single-digit growth. And finally, we expect our vaccine franchise to grow in mid single-digits.","As mentioned in our press release for the second quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.12 to $1.14 and sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, foreign currency may have a modest negative impact on sales growth in the quarter. Thanks, and now let me open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe a couple of quick questions on the model, then maybe more of a strategic question. I guess a couple quick nits on the model. Spec pharm, you talked about a slight change of guidance for the year. I wondered, does that reflect more just the utilization environment you're seeing here in the first quarter or any change to what you're thinking about the timing of generics in the back half of the year? And the second financial question was non-op guidance is roughly equivalent to what you guided for a few quarters -- or sorry, a few months ago, but a very strong non-op quarter, this particular quarter. Maybe you could just walk through some of those dynamics, and then one follow-up.","Robert J. Hombach","Okay.","Robert L. Parkinson","Bob, go ahead.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I think, David, your comments about softer surgical procedures are really what drove -- but there's no change in our expectation about the potential for generic competition later this year in this space, so no change there. And as it relates to the non-op items, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, 2 real drivers there: one, foreign exchange; the other one, sale of an intangible asset. And so the FX item really related to some volatility around the euro in the first quarter. As you know, the euro traded anywhere from $1.37 to $1.27 during the course of the quarter, and given our balance sheet positions and the quarters and the months in which it was most volatile, we had a pretty significant outcome there. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we also took some costs into -- in the margin that we hadn't expected for this quarter. We expect it later in the year of approximately $20 million. And so as I look at the overall picture, those 2 kind of offset.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Then maybe 2 strategic questions for Bob. I guess interesting competitive chatter at some recent conferences, Bob, I wondered if you could comment. The first is surrounding Glendale and the progress. There is some discussion that perhaps Baxter's behind in their process at Glendale and the refurbishment. Maybe help us understand where you think you are as it relates to Glendale and capacity at the back half of the year. And then hemophilia competition, which is obviously coming next year, another strong hemophilia quarter for Baxter at this particular quarter. Maybe talk just a little about what you're seeing on the strength of PK dosing and the larger 4,000-unit dose and how you expect that to trend this year.","Robert L. Parkinson","Sure. In terms of old L.A., we're back in operation consistent with the timetable that we set up, actually a little bit ahead of schedule. So we're very pleased with getting that back in production for reasons that we all understand. So no concerns on that issue. Relative to the core hemophilia franchise, we continue to see a momentum in the U.S. in response to the PK dosing, prophylaxis use and so on, continue to be encouraged by that. So as it relates to the momentum in that business, particularly in the U.S. and in view of new competitive entrants down the road, fundamentally, David, I'd say no change in our position on that regard from what we've discussed with you previously. I don't know, Mary Kay, if you want to add anything to that?","Mary Kay Ladone","No. I was just going to say, David, we have started conformance lots in old L.A. And as Bob mentioned, we remain on track for clearance and to start shipping product in the third quarter, so no change in expectations there. And I'd also point out that the strong recombinant sales driven, really, by ADVATE in the U.S., we are expecting to take out some inventory as we move throughout the year, so we aren't expecting in our guidance to continue to see as strong a performance going forward.","Operator","Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray is online with a question.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a follow-up on hemophilia. You mentioned in your prepared remarks there's a -- there was sort of a contribution from competitive gains, there's a contribution from increased penetration of prophylaxis and sort of utilization on the ADVATE side. Could you maybe talk about what kind of share you're starting to see here competitively, how much interest there is in this sort of flexible dosing model that you have?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. I don't know, Matt, that we can add a lot more to my comments in response to David Lewis' question. And we're not going to get into specific market share changes and \"market shares\" and so on. Again, as I've said before, we get a good market response, continue to get good market response for the PK dosing and prophylaxis use and so on, which we're very encouraged by and it's consistent with what we had expected from the outset. So beyond that, I'm not sure that there's a lot more we can say or we want to say at this stage.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I would just add that the good news here is that we have multiple avenues to drive accelerated growth going forward, converting plasma-derived even with our own patient base, converting on-demand to prophylaxis and then certainly for those patients that are looking for the opportunity to do less infusions on an annual basis moving towards PK dosing. So again, we're pursuing all those avenues, and I think the 4,000 IU presentation is going to allow us to continue to drive the PK dosing going forward here. Still somewhat early days because it was the third quarter of last year that we really started launching that, but we're seeing progress on all 3 fronts.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's understandable. And then the -- on the Alzheimer's program, you mentioned wrapping up the trial in '15. Just maybe walk us through, if you could. You have made some decent progress. This is the second trial and about halfway through enrollments currently. Can you walk through why it would take -- why expect it to take till '15 to complete that?","Robert L. Parkinson","Mary Kay, why don't you handle that?","Mary Kay Ladone","Sure. Matt, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we have already enrolled about 200 of the 400 patients, and we are expecting to complete enrollment by the end of this year. As you recall, the trial designed for the second Phase III is exactly similar to the first Phase III. So it's an 18-month follow-up, which would mean that we wouldn't complete the trial until mid-2015.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then finally, just on the fluid systems in the quarter. I didn't catch the color on why exactly the weakness there, at least relative to our estimates. It sounded like, from your perspective, the growth was in line or sort of was solid growth in the quarter but, I guess, maybe...","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Yes, it was in line with our expectations. But I think it's important to remember, given the pace of activity in 2012 as we finalized the swap out of COLLEAGUE's and placed a lot of spectrums in the marketplace, we expected going into 2013 that pump sales would be lower than 2012, again, because of that elevated level of activity. And as we look at results in the past, they were again in line with our expectations, and so no issues there.","Operator","Larry Keusch of Raymond James is on the line with a question.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess for Bob Hombach. The 2013 guidance, when you take the first quarter, and the guidance for the 2Q implies that you drive greater EPS in the back half of the year. So could you just remind us again what are the drivers of the increased profitability in the second half of the year?","Robert J. Hombach","Sure, sure. Multiple impacts here. So first off, we do expect to have enhanced flexibility on capacity and supply to the market in the plasma business as we move into the third quarter. As we mentioned, we are producing now, and we expect to be able to start shipping product in the third quarter on the plasma front. And just the way tenders have worked out this year, if I step back and look at sales calendarization for 2013 for the company, Q1, given some year-over-year comp issues around timing of tenders as well as this selling day issue, we have 1 less day in Q1, we'll have 1 more in Q3. Q2 and Q4, I would characterize as normal. And then in Q3 in particular, some significant emerging market-related tenders are scheduled this year versus prior years being in different quarters, so we do expect accelerated top line growth related to that as well. The benefits of our business optimization efforts that we announced at the end of the fourth quarter this year, we'll start to see enhanced benefits from that as we move throughout the course of the year. So those are just some of the key drivers.","Mary Kay Ladone","And Larry, I would just add, just so everybody knows. I mean, gross margin, we do expect to be lower in the second half as we bring the Gambro business into the mix. So just so you have that, it will be lower than the first half.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then just 2 other quick ones. Can you just help us understand the implications of the warning letter on the Spectrum pump and how that folds into your guidance for this year? And then, separately, on the Phase III Alzheimer's data, the first trial where you're expecting the top line results of it 2Q, is that actually tied to a scientific meaning? Or is that sort of a press release as you finalize that data analysis?","Robert L. Parkinson","All right. Let me -- I'll address the question on the warning letter. Mary Kay, why don't you respond on the Alzheimer's question? So the warning letter that was communicated earlier this week really has to do with the clearance status on some modifications that have been made to the SIGMA Spectrum pump over the years since the initial approval, the initial 510(k), a number of years ago. So the agency has requested additional information and documentation from us on those changes. That was largely the basis of the warning letter. The implications going forward is, in response to your question, Larry, yes, there will be some impact on that on sales for the rest of the year, largely having to do with our focus. And actually, the -- per our discussions and agreement with the FDA, we're going to continue to support service and place devices in our existing accounts. The majority of our sales of SIGMA are into our existing account base. However, until we get these issues resolved, submit the data, get it reviewed, which we would hope to get completed this fall and typically, there'd be about a 90-day review period, we are not going to place SIGMA devices in, what I'll call, new accounts or competitive accounts. And so there is some sales and margin loss as a result of that action. Obviously, it didn't impact our overall sales guidance. So does that answer your question?","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And I take it you don't want to quantify how much you think you may lose.","Robert L. Parkinson","I don't know. Bob, why don't you [indiscernible].","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, yes. Well, yes, I think I can at least frame for you what our expectation was. So in our original 2013 guidance, we assumed approximately $80 million in sales related to Spectrum in the U.S. And so, obviously, we have 1 quarter under our belt and sales were approximately $20 million. And then as Bob mentioned, a little bit more than 1\/2 of our sales were targeted to go towards existing customers as well. So I think as you peel off the pieces here and you think about the last 9 months of the year and how much sales we had in the original expectation and the fact that a fair amount of that was targeted towards existing customers, we think this is manageable within the context of the mid-products guidance as well as the overall company's sales and EPS guidance.","Robert L. Parkinson","Mary Kay, in Alzheimer's? Go ahead.","Mary Kay Ladone","Larry, the update on Alzheimer's. So as we mentioned, we did lock the database recently and we're in the process of analyzing the data. So we do expect to issue a press release during the second quarter with the top line results. I think as we mentioned last quarter, we do plan to have the full data set available at an upcoming medical conference, which is in July.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So a couple of cleanup questions here. The issue you cited in the BioPharma Solutions, the partnering business this quarter, that sounds like it's been resolved. Will there be a catch-up in the second quarter, such that the business that you lost this quarter, you'd get in the second quarter?","Robert L. Parkinson","It won't all be in the second quarter, but most of it will be caught up, Mike, in the remainder of the year.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. On HyQ, or HyQvia, the preclinical work that you were doing for the FDA, could you update us on where you are? Have you done the interim analysis for that? And can you give us some insights into when that will be presented to the agency?","Robert L. Parkinson","Go ahead, Mary Kay.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes. Mike, we have the interim data. And we do plan on meeting with the FDA in the second quarter as we had articulated at the last conference call.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is that anything that we will see, that data?","Mary Kay Ladone","No. But we'll be able to give you an update probably at the second quarter call on where we are with HyQ after the meeting with the FDA.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and just one more. In the process here with Gambro, have you been able to gain any additional insights into their business or anything that might change your views on integration or on the opportunity for the acquisition, either short- or longer-term?","Robert L. Parkinson","No. No major changes.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the -- and lastly then, just on the performance of the renal side of the business this quarter, you cited some austerity measures in China. Can you maybe just call out what those were and anything else that [indiscernible] that?","Robert L. Parkinson","They were largely price reductions. Bob, why don't you comment?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Yes, I mean we've characterized austerity overall as impacting top line and margin, frankly, by approximately $90 million for the full year. China's about 1\/3 of that, not all of it related to the renal business but a good chunk of it is related to the renal business. This is something that had been discussed for the last several years and they finally implemented a rebasing of the reimbursement level there. And so we continue to have strong growth from a patient perspective, working very closely with the government in China, see great opportunities to continue to expand our footprint there, but we are encountering a price reduction here in 2013 that's going to impact growth rates.","Operator","Matt Dodds of Citigroup in on the line with a question.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. On Gambro, do you have an update on where the EU regulatory authorities are for NHS?","Robert J. Hombach","No. I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment at this point in time. We continue to work closely with them, and that's all we can say at this point.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then for albumin, up 2% similar with IG, is that also entirely due to the constraints on the supply? Or is albumin that more of the -- your growth rate you're seeing?","Robert J. Hombach","No, no. I mean we're continuing to sell all the albumin we can make, and so we do have some seasonality to availability of supply, given normal year-end shutdowns we do in most of our facilities and so on. We do expect strong albumin growth throughout the course of the rest of the year, so I think it's really just a Q1 phenomenon here.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So most of the tenders you commented on in Q1 at the time, that was plasma factor VIII?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, that is correct, Matt.","Operator","David Roman of Goldman Sachs in on the line with a question.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up a little more on the IVIG and albumin dynamics. I -- understandably, there are some factors influencing your growth rate right now. But as we sort of look to the balance of the year and beyond that, what do you think it's going to take for you to get back to growing at or above market rates? And I think most would say that IVIG is still growing at sort of high single-digit range and albumin probably tracking surgical volumes globally, but -- what's the path to getting your business back toward kind of that sort of market growth rate in either of those franchises?","Robert L. Parkinson","More capacity. Go ahead, Bob. I don't...","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I mean, I think this really is -- I mean, we continue to see very strong demand for our product. As you know, because of the constraints we've had, we've had to be very selective about which markets outside the U.S. we even participate in, as an example. And so I -- we do continue to see strong demand for IGs globally and so what we expect, as we bring meaningful capacity online here and get old L.A. back into a mode where we can sell the product commercially, that we're going to be able to participate at least at market growth rates going forward. And as it relates to albumin, while I would say your characterization around -- in most countries this tracking with surgical volumes and so on is probably pretty good with the exception of China, which I think continues to be in a situation where because of decisions they've taken locally about shutting down collection and so on, they're going to continue to import a significant amount of albumin going forward. And that's one, I think, that offers an opportunity us for here -- for us to continue to grow as we have more capacity come online.","Robert L. Parkinson","And that looks to be a long-term opportunity also.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then some of the decisions that you've taken in Europe obviously makes sense given the capacity constraints and the relative pricing environment, but do you think that has any impact on your ability to launch HyQ there and gain traction? Is there something that has to happen from a tender perspective for you to get that product on the market? Or is there enough of a sort of high-end segment of the market that would be able to adopt it at reasonable ASPs pretty quickly?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I think a couple of factors. Number one, I mean, we do -- we are very excited about the opportunity both in Europe and the U.S. for HyQ. We think this is a significant improvement for patients from a convenient standpoint while offering all the safety and efficacy that we see in our base product. And so over the long-term, we think HyQ is a great opportunity. But as we hopefully get approval here and can launch in the back half of 2013 in Europe, it's going to be a controlled launch. We have the issue of capacity to consider here as well. But we are still in a number of important markets in Western Europe as an example, and so I think there's plenty of opportunity within the markets we're a major participant in today to initially launch HyQ. We are going to launch at a premium because we do think the product, given its characteristics and convenience that it offers, is worthy of a meaningful premium. And so, again, we're going to do a controlled launch, ensure our patients and treaters are aware of the process for the enhanced therapy and that it gets off to a very good start because we do want to make sure this is successful over the long-term. So in the near-term, I don't see this being an issue in terms of market participation in Europe because the key markets we would likely launch HyQ in, anyway, were already in still with IGs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- and maybe just one financial question. As I look at the SG&A number this quarter as a percentage of revenue, I think that's the highest it's been in quite some time and you did cite some promotional activities and investments that you're making. But how should we think about the opportunity for leverage on the discretionary line items going forward? Are you entering more of an investment period to drive top line growth in areas like emerging markets? Or is there something sort of more one-off in the first quarter whereby that line item should start to look a little bit more like it has in the past going forward?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I think a couple of dynamics. For the full year, for sure, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we expect in the base Baxter expense base, we're going to drive leverage relative to sales for the full year. Q1 has some interesting dynamics. Obviously, given the issues in our pharma partnering business, we came in a little bit lower on the top line in the quarter. As it relates to things like pension expense, that accounted for about 1.5% of growth in the quarter given that impact for the full year. As I mentioned, our business optimization efforts will provide increasing benefits as we move throughout the course of the year. We have been and will continue to make the right investments to ensure we can enhance our position in emerging and developing markets, so no change there. We do have some additional spending in advance of some of the key product launches like we've discussed today around HyQ and also Home HD, which we've made good progress on the trial, as Bob mentioned in his comments, and look for CE Mark here in Europe. So I think it's a balance of targeted investment for the growth opportunities we have and leveraging our existing base through process reengineering.","Operator","Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank is on the line with a question.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just -- I just wanted to clarify, in the other income line that you had said that, that did include $10 million of a gain related to a sale of an intangible. Any color on that?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes -- no, I mean, it's an arrangement we had in a country, so I don't think it's something we want to get into a lot of detail around. It is a one-off. But as I mentioned, the other driver there was FX and other income. It's not something we planned or expect to incur again.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then just kind of walking through the gross margin, it sounds like that was more moderated. Is that simply all foreign currency? Or is that any other thing impacting your expectations on the gross margin line?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. It definitely is currency-related.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then any update on the recombinant von Willebrand products in terms of the trial or expected launch or approval for filing?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes. Kristen, I think we had mentioned that we had completed enrollment in the end of fourth quarter, and we actually have now completed the dosing of the last patient.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then when might you be in the position to I guess file with the FDA on that?","Mary Kay Ladone","Well, there's a 12-month follow-up, so we will complete the trial probably beginning of next year and file next year.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just lastly, Mary Kay, I think you had mentioned on ADVATE that you are planning on taking down inventory for the balance of the year. Could you just maybe explain why that is?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Kristen, I think we've talked throughout the course of a few quarters last year, there has been some shakeout in the U.S. amongst the SPPs from a market share standpoint. And as a result, one of our key customers has gotten in the situation where they've lost some share and we're working with them to rightsize their inventory level, given that new share situation. And so I think over the next several quarters, we're talking in the range of approximately $15 million that we'll be working off from a U.S. recombinant standpoint.","Operator","Bob Hopkins of Bank of America is on the line with a question.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of quick things. First, just given the visibility of the Alzheimer's program, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a direct sense on timing within the second quarter. Should we expect that's more a first half disclosure or a second half disclosure? And have you -- just give us a little update on exactly what you'll be presenting within those headline results in the press release.","Robert L. Parkinson","Go ahead, Mary Kay.","Mary Kay Ladone","Right.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I would say we can't be more specific. As we mentioned, we locked the database and we're working diligently with our partner on this, ADCS, and so we're certainly as motivated as everyone to get the results compiled and be able to release those. As we mentioned earlier, it will be in the form initially of a press release for the top line results of the 2 primary endpoints and some subgroup analysis related to mild versus moderate and APOE-4 versus non-APOE-4. Those are the stratifications that we'll be able to provide initially. And as Mary Kay mentioned then, the full data set at a conference likely in July.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, great. And then the other question I have was just -- I was wondering if you could give us an update on the 855 program, just in terms of milestones and timeline that we should expect for the rest this year and going forward, given that obviously a pretty important program from a competitive perspective.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks, Bob. BAX 855, we started the Phase III trial and we began dosing patients during the first quarter. This trial includes over 100 patients, and we expect to complete enrollment by the end of this year, and we are remaining on track to file sometime next year.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, great. And then just last pipeline question for me. I realize this is a bit of a softball question, but can you just give me a sense of the best case scenario on HyQ in the U.S.? If things go as well as you hope they could possibly go, what would that mean from a timing perspective?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. We're not -- I don't think we're going to speculate on that. Obviously, we have our meeting with the FDA, which we've described. We were encouraged by the progress we've made in Europe. Hopefully, that will be helpful with our discussions here in the U.S. But I think, Bob, to speculate beyond that, we don't want to do that. So...","Mary Kay Ladone","Bob, just recall though that we aren't going to complete the pre-clinical trial till the end of this year. So obviously, we'll have more information once we meet with the FDA on the interim results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm curious, Bob, if you can give us your interpretation of what's occurring in the U.S. with respect to utilization. We've seen hospitals now preannounce disappointing results, some lab companies as well. Do you think we're seeing a heightened seasonality in the fourth quarter and that's pulling sales from the first quarter? Just any color you can provide.","Robert L. Parkinson","I think the market is soft. It's going to continue to remain soft, I think is our view. I think as it relates to our products, given the nature, the medically necessary nature of our products, the impact will be modest. But I think to suggest that you're going to see a turnaround, Glenn, from the softness we've seen over the last quarter or so would probably be a little too optimistic. I just think the market conditions are going to continue to be very challenging.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up, a lot of investors ask me about 2014 with respect to health care reform, should we anticipate a volume bump? What are your thoughts on that?","Robert L. Parkinson","I wouldn't -- I don't anticipate to see any meaningful incremental impact on our business due to evolving health care reform implementation and so on. So whether it's 2014, Glenn, or out over the long-range plan, frankly, our views going forward haven't changed from our investor conference last fall on this. So -- look, the -- we all know what the general dynamics are globally, even outside the U.S., which is a difficult economic environment, health care costs continue to rise at a rate that is beyond any government's ability to control, and there are going to continue to be impacts that we characterize as \"austerity measures\" on health care spending that I think are going to continue to impact all multinational companies, whether it's in the U.S. or outside the U.S. But again -- and I would not suggest that we're impervious to those kinds of impacts, but they will be evolutionary in nature. They're not going to be major step-function impacts. And again, as I said earlier, I'd emphasized, given the medically necessary nature of our products, we think we're going to be able to withstand this, certainly, reasonably well. And where the focus really is, as it always has been in this industry, is innovation. And with our emerging pipeline, not to mention the expanding capacity position over time on plasma proteins and continued robust demand for those products, that's where our focus is. And we certainly can, I think, withstand the general macro dynamics that we discussed.","Operator","Our final question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","May -- if I could ask a little more color on the home hemo program, it seems to be clearly on track as you've suggested in the past. Maybe just remind us again, when the trial wraps up, what the filing and approval timing process is. And I keep thinking that, just given the current market dynamics, that this is a more promising program than ever. Any thoughts again if -- about the potential penetration or the opportunity here?","Mary Kay Ladone","I'll take the first half of the question, Rick, and then Bob can take the market opportunity part of your question. But in terms of the trial, the Canadian trial is going to be wrapping up here in the second quarter, and then we'll be wrapping up the submission. And we expect the CE Marking by the end of this year. As you recall, in the U.S., we're still in discussions with the FDA as to whether or not they will require 1 or 2 trials here in the U.S. But we're still planning for a nocturnal indication filing in 2014.","Robert L. Parkinson","So Rick, Bob Parkinson here, maybe just to wrap up on the kind of the higher level question. We continue to be extremely enthusiastic about the opportunity associated with home -- our home hemodialysis product, which we think has a number of dimensions or characteristics that can differentiate it from the home hemo products that are on the market today, not to mention to leverage our global position as really the leading dialysis provider in the home setting, which has real value here. I think when you take a step back and look at this, this is the kind of product that is responsive to, I think, the new realities of the global economic environment and health care environment. The opportunity to enhance clinical outcomes, we think, meaningfully particularly with home nocturnal hemo, to provide, as a result, increased convenience for the patient to deliver therapy in their home, and to do it in a way that fundamentally lowers the cost versus conventional in-center hemodialysis is really the kinds of products going forward that we think there's going to be a great response in the marketplace to. The only caveat, I would say, is the nature of this requires a motivated patient. That doesn't describe 100% of the patient population. So in no way do I want to suggest that, that traditional home in-center hemo is going to continue to be both the growth vehicle and the primary therapy to address end-stage renal disease, hence, our excitement about the Gambro acquisition. But I appreciate your question because I think as we go forward, get this product launched in Europe and expand beyond that, this is a product opportunity that's very significant for the company going forward.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. And just last quick one on China. I want to make sure I understood what -- Bob Hombach, you were talking about in your med product comment, China austerity. I just want to make sure I understood what you were talking about. And I hope I didn't miss it, but did you talk about the timing of ADVATE reimbursement? I don't think you've gotten it yet. When are you expecting that and when are you expecting that Chinese launch?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes -- no, my comments about reimbursement adjustment down relates specifically to the renal business. We have got -- the launch of ADVATE in China is going to be -- it will take a long time to play out. The treatment rates today in China for hemophiliacs are very low even on plasma-derived. So we've got a long way to go to develop that market, but that's one that could be primed for some of our approaches here around public-private partnerships. But we're a long way from anything there.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes. Rick, we are waiting reimbursement approval. You may recall, we did get approval for the product last year. But we can't launch until we have the reimbursement approved, which we expect in the second half of this year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Norbert Riedel, Chief Science and Innovation Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thanks for calling in. We're pleased today to announce our financial results for the third quarter and also provide you with an update on Baxter's full year 2012 outlook. As you saw in the press release that was issued earlier this morning, third quarter sales, after adjusting for FX, increased 5%. EPS of $1.14 per diluted share increased 5% versus the prior year and was in line with the guidance that we previously provided.","As we discussed with you all last week at the Investor Conference, we continue to focus on enhancing growth by optimizing our core business portfolio, advancing the company's new product pipeline, pursuing and accelerating the pace of business development initiatives and capitalizing on the opportunity to develop new business models, which includes public and private partnerships and at improving the quality of and access to care in both developed and emerging markets.","Recent achievements reflect these priorities and were highlighted in this morning's press release. As many of these topics were also covered thoroughly last week, I won't take too much time to review these in depth, but I'd like to take a moment to highlight just a few key points. First, we continue to be very pleased with the success of our new ADVATE prophylaxis label in the U.S. market as evidenced by our strong sales performance in the quarter. And we remain committed to meeting patient needs by enhancing our plasma manufacturing footprint with both internal capacity expansions and external collaborations.","Second, we continue to successfully advance our pipeline. For example, during the quarter, we submitted our regulatory file in the U.S. for BAX 326, a recombinant Factor IX protein, which if approved, will be the only Factor IX product indicated for prophylaxis treatment in the U.S., where most hemophilia B patients today are treated with an on-demand regimen.","We also recently completed enrollment in our first home hemodialysis clinical trial, evaluating the performance and safety of our new device. This study was conducted at 2 centers in the U.S. with 24 patients who collectively received more than 700 dialysis treatments. As you know, this data will support our European CE marking in 2013.","On the business development front, we entered into a collaboration with Onconova for European commercialization rights of rigosertib, a novel targeted anticancer compound. It's currently in a Phase III study for the treatment of MDS, a rare hematological malignancy, and is also in Phase II for an oral formulation for this indication. If approved, this will be an exciting addition to our portfolio, where we can leverage our legacy of treating critical diseases, our existing leadership position in hematology and our sales channel. While hematology is our primary focus for this drug candidate, rigosertib is also in Phase II clinical trials for pancreatic cancer.","In addition, under the terms of our agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, we recently selected a third biosimilar for development, a monoclonal antibody for oncology designated as M511. This is in addition to the selection of M923 and M834 targeted for the treatment of autoimmune and other inflammatory disorders. As you know, Baxter and Momenta had the opportunity to develop up to 6 biosimilars through our partnership.","And finally, as we mentioned at our conference last week, the Brazilian government announced the award of an exclusive recombinant Factor VIII hemophilia partnership in Brazil, the third-largest hemophilia market in the world. While this agreement has not yet been finalized, we're working closely with the authorities there to enhance access to treatment and provide recombinant therapies to patients, and we look forward to updating you on the significance of this award in the coming weeks.","In summary, our core portfolio remains strong, and we continue to benefit from our focus on life-saving therapies, which drives demand, moderates economic headwinds and gives us a platform for geographic expansion. Our pipeline, as we discussed last week, is robust, addressing key high-potential areas of unmet medical need. We've accelerated the pace of business development. We remain disciplined to ensure these opportunities align with our core strength. And we're committed to working with payers by establishing public and private partnerships, as we're very well-positioned to provide solutions to their increasing challenges. These are the vectors that will support our growth and they'll enable us to serve the interests of patients and reward our shareholders well into the future.","As always, I'd be happy to address any questions on these or other topics during the Q&A this morning. And with that, I'd like to ask Bob to review our third quarter financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the third quarter, excluding special items, increased 5% to $1.14 per diluted share, which was at the high end of the guidance range we previously provided of $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.","As mentioned in the press release, our GAAP results included an after-tax special charge of $45 million or $0.08 per diluted share related to the recently announced European licensing agreement with Onconova.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the quarter before turning to our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled approximately $3.5 billion in the third quarter and were comparable to last year. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 5%, in line with our guidance, with notable double-digit sales growth of ADVATE and GAMMAGARD LIQUID in the U.S. and solid double-digit growth across many emerging markets.","Collectively, this strength offset continued softness across mature markets in Western Europe. Third quarter sales also included a benefit from the integration of the Synovis and Baxa acquisitions with combined sales of $65 million.","In terms of individual business performance, Global BioScience sales of $1.5 billion were flat to last year. And excluding foreign currency, sales increased 5%.","Within the product categories, recombinant sales increased 1% and totaled $555 million. On a constant-currency basis, sales increased 5%, as double-digit growth of 11% in the U.S. was partially offset by the impact of the Australian tender. Excluding the impact of this tender, global recombinant sales advanced 8%.","As Bob mentioned earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the strength of our U.S. business, where we continue to realize benefits associated with the new expanded label of ADVATE, drive conversion from plasma-derived therapies and competitive offerings and enhance penetration of prophylactic treatment.","Moving on to plasma proteins. Sales in the quarter were $337 million and were down 9%. On a constant-currency basis, sales declined 4%, as strong mid-teens growth in the U.S. was more than offset by lower tender sales of FEIBA and plasma-derived Factor VIII, primarily in Brazil. Excluding this impact, plasma proteins sales increased 9% on a constant-currency basis, with key products like FEIBA, albumin and ARALAST registering double-digit gains.","In antibody therapy, sales of $404 million increased 6%. Excluding currency, sales accelerated 9%, driven by unit volume growth in mid-single digits and positive price benefits resulting from favorable shifts in our geographic mix as we optimize our global supply in light of the L.A. facility shutdown, which is currently under way. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our performance in the U.S., where antibody therapy sales advanced 12%, driven by robust demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID as we continue to promote awareness and diagnosis of primary immune deficiency and drive enhanced penetration of SubQ therapy, given our favorable tolerability profile and low infusion site reaction rate.","As a reminder, global sales related to the Octapharma absence in the third quarter of 2011 were approximately $20 million. After adjusting for this, antibody therapy revenues advanced more than 15%.","In the third quarter, sales in regenerative medicine advanced 15%, to $165 million. On a constant-currency basis, sales rose 20%, driven by growth of TISSEEL and FLOSEAL and the incremental benefit from Synovis acquisition of approximately $20 million.","Finally, revenues in the other category totaled $61 million in the quarter and declined 13%. Excluding foreign currency, sales were flat, as lower third-party plasma sales were offset by growth of vaccines, including the ongoing revenues related to our influenza collaboration in Japan with Takeda.","In Medical Products, global sales in the third quarter of approximately $2 billion were comparable to last year. Sales increased 4% on a constant-currency basis. Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $629 million and declined 3%. Excluding currency, sales increased 2%, as global PD growth, supported by solid patient gains, was offset by lower HD revenues.","Sales in the Global Injectables category of $509 million increased 3%. And on a constant-currency basis, sales increased 7%. Performance continues to be driven by significant growth in our international pharma-partnering and compounding businesses; growth of certain injectable therapeutics like cyclophosphamide, a generic oncology drug; and the incremental benefit of the Baxa acquisition, with sales of approximately $10 million.","IV Therapies sales advanced 6%, to $479 million. Excluding currency, sales increased 12%, driven by higher demand for IV and nutritional therapies and sales of $35 million related to the Baxa acquisition.","Infusion system sales totaled $186 million and were lower than the prior year by 16%. On a constant-currency basis, sales declined 14% due to lower access set revenues and the difficult comparison presented by the completed transition to the spectrum pump in the U.S.","Finally, our anesthesia franchise posted sales of $135 million, reflecting an increase of 5%. Excluding currency, sales advanced 9%, driven by solid gains in Sevoflurane and Suprane, particularly in international markets.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin for the company improved to 52.1%, reflecting sequential expansion and an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This was a result of underlying operational expansion, driven primarily by positive mix, and a benefit from foreign currency. These factors more than offset a number of headwinds, including pension, amortization of intangible assets related to recent business development activities and austerity measures.","SG&A totaled $743 million and increased 5%, with 3 points of growth associated with the integration of recent acquisitions. We also continue to invest in promotional and marketing initiatives and in international markets to enhance our global presence.","These items, along with incremental pension expense, more than offset the benefit from foreign currency, aggressive management of discretionary spending and the operational efficiencies derived from our PowerUp reengineering initiatives.","As expected, R&D spending moderated in the third quarter and totaled $240 million. Growth on a constant-currency basis was in high-single digits, as we continue to advance a number of programs, including those in our leading hemophilia franchise, the Alzheimer's programs and Phase III adult stem cell trial.","The operating margin in the quarter was 23.8%, an improvement of almost 200 basis points sequentially and slightly higher than the margin in the third quarter of last year. Interest expense was $25 million and compared to $14 million last year. This increase is due to incremental expense associated with recent debt issuances and lower interest income. Other income totaled $14 million in the quarter compared to expense of $6 million last year, primarily a result of favorable foreign exchange impact on balance sheet positions, which total approximately $10 million.","The tax rate was 23% for the quarter, higher than projected due to earnings mix, which brings the year-to-date rate to 22%.","And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted EPS was $1.14 per diluted share, an increase of 5%.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $747 million, and on a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion advanced 12%. Capital expenditures of $259 million in the third quarter compares to spending of $235 million in 2011.","DSO ended the quarter at 57 days compared to a DSO of 54.5 days last year. This increase can be attributed to growth in both the U.S. and international receivables. Inventory turns of 2.3 are lower than turns of 2.5 last year due to the impact of recent acquisitions and increased inventory levels to support late-stage clinical trials and growing demand.","Lastly, on a year-to-date basis, we repurchased 19 million shares for $1.9 billion or on a net basis, approximately 13 million shares for $772 million, and we remain on track to achieve our full year objective of net share repurchases totaling approximately 1 billion.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2012. First, for the full year, we now expect earnings of $4.51 to $4.54 per diluted share. By line item of the P&L and starting with sales, we continue to project full year sales growth, excluding foreign currency, of 4% to 5%.  Given our current outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to have a negative impact on the top line of approximately 3 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported sales growth, which includes the impact of foreign currency, to be approximately 2%.","We now expect full year gross margin rate for the company to expand modestly versus last year's rate of 51.4%.","We expect SG&A to grow in mid-single digits, and now we expect R&D to grow in high-single digits. We now expect interest expense to total approximately $90 million and other, including noncontrolling interests, to be an income item of approximately $50 million, driven primarily by benefit of currency and a benefit in the first half related to minority interest income.","Given the interest -- excuse me, given the year-to-date changes in our earnings mix, we now expect a tax rate of approximately 22% with a full year average share count of approximately 555 million shares, which assumes 1 billion in net share repurchases.","From a cash flow perspective, we plan to generate cash flow from operations of more than $3 billion.","Now to expand on the full year sales assumptions for each of the businesses. First, on a constant-currency basis, we continue to expect Medical Products sales to grow in the mid-single digits. This includes IV therapy sales growth of approximately 10%; anesthesia sales growth in mid-single digits; global injectable sales growth in mid-single digits; lower infusion system sales, which are expected to decline approximately 5% to 10%; and lastly, renal sales are expected to grow in low-single digits.","For BioScience, we continue to project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, in the mid-single digits. Our outlook includes: recombinant sales growth in low- to mid-single digits, reflecting the strong year-to-date growth in the U.S.; plasma protein sales growth in low-single digits; antibody therapy sales growth in mid-single digits; regenerative medicine sales growth approaching 20%; and finally, we expect the other category to grow approximately 5%, which includes an anticipated milestone payment in the fourth quarter related to our U.S. influenza vaccine program.","As mentioned in our press release, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.24 to $1.27 and sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 5% to 6%. Based on our outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to impact sales by approximately 2 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%.","Thanks, and now we'll open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bob, I know that it's obviously early here, and you haven't given a specific guidance for 2013. But would you mind just sharing some thoughts on just how you're thinking about the environment as we sort of head into next year?","Robert L. Parkinson","Sure, Larry. Let me -- I'll make some comments and then maybe turn it over to Bob Hombach. I mean, hopefully you all got a good context of this last week, and you're right, we're not going to get into specifics for 2013 this morning. I mean, clearly, we anticipate that the environment is going to continue to be very challenging. That's one of the assumptions that Bob Hombach had on one of his early slides in the presentation last week, going to continue to be very demanding. Obviously, as we move into '13, we do have a couple of issues that we're going to need to deal with, which are unique to next year. The device tax, which you're all familiar with, which is not insignificant in its impact. We're going to continue to be constrained on plasma capacity through the year in 2014, of course, with the Sanquin deal that we recently announced that will put us in a much better position. Interest rates remain very low. So in terms of pension exposure and so on, that might be a bit of a headwind as well. But you got a sense of the long-term guidance last week that Bob provided. The environment's going to continue to be challenging. But as I commented in my prepared comments this morning, the underlying drivers of our business continue to be very solid, and we're making I think great progress on a lot of fronts. So I'll stop there. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything to that. I probably covered most of the things that you would comment on but there may be, you or Mary Kay.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, yes, I would just reiterate a lot of what Bob said but also just highlight a few of the key factors that we talked about last week. Certainly, our expectation around the environment, as it relates to Western Europe in particular, is that we don't see any significant improvement. We started out this year with an expectation that Western Europe was going to be, call it, flattish in 2012, and that held up pretty well through the first half of the year, but we certainly saw incremental softness in the third quarter and now expect for the full year that Western Europe, from a top line perspective, will be down slightly. And as we go into next year, that's something we'll definitely be factoring into our thinking. But the dynamics of the business, as we talked about yesterday, we still see opportunities to drive incremental leverage, whether it's in gross margin or in SG&A over time, modest but incremental through some of our reengineering initiatives, to the positive business mix that we expect to continue to see in the business, even withstanding some of the headwinds that Bob mentioned that we've already talked about for 2013. And putting it all together is why we directionally indicated last week that our long-range outlook is 7% to 9% for EPS growth but that 2013 would be at the low end of that.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just one other quick one, you mentioned infusion, and I understand the comps. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics in the set business and the ability to now start to perhaps raise price on pumps now that the COLLEAGUE recall has been completed?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, this is Bob Parkinson, Larry. We're not going to comment specifically on pricing strategies for reasons I'm sure you understand. We completed the COLLEAGUE activity in terms of all the pumps out of the market. So we continue to manage through what I'll call kind of a stabilizing time in the market. We had, as Bob mentioned, some tough comps because a year ago was when we were pretty significantly expanding our SIGMA placements. So I think this, the set business, the access set business, it's starting to settle out. I would tell you I don't see a robust turnaround in that at all in the coming couple of quarters. I think we're still going to go through what I'll just -- as I characterized kind of a settling out period here. Mary Kay, or...","Robert J. Hombach","Yes.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, I would agree, Larry. We're not expecting the set revenue growth to change dramatically for the next several quarters, due to the comps, as now we've replaced all the COLLEAGUEs with the SPECTRUM, but we are seeing now the share loss that we've experienced impact our disposable set sales.","Operator","Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan is on the line with a question. Our next question comes from Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just on recombinants. I think, obviously, the U.S. market looks like it continues to be pretty strong here. And I know you had talked about stocking in the first half and I was just wondering if you could just give us some perspective on whether the growth you're seeing now is really representative of what you think is the underlying growth rate in the market. And then maybe also, if you could, any level of quantification on where you think penetration is in terms of adult prophylaxis now versus say, 1 year ago?","Robert L. Parkinson","Okay. Bob and Mary Kay, you guys want to...","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Rajeev, we certainly have seen strong results here in the first 3 quarters. As we talked about in the first half of the year, with the new ADVATE prophy label, we did expect that some of that was stocking. As we go into the fourth quarter, our expectation would be to grow more in line with the market, maybe slightly faster but certainly not the double digits that we've been posting here. I would say though that we are in the early days of really benefiting from the PK dosing, the every 3-day dosing opportunity that we have within the U.S. As Ludwig Hantson mentioned last week, with the August approval for the 4,000 IU for ADVATE, that really puts us in a great position to go out and work with patients and treaters, to convert them to every 3-day dosing, because that allows them to use a single vial to do the increased dosing required to do every 3 days. So we're very early days in that as well. We are very excited about the opportunity, but I would expect in the fourth quarter, we'd see a moderation here from the growth rate that we've seen in the first 3 quarters, but still strong.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, Rajeev, I would add, I don't have a year-over-year perspective I can give you on adult prophylaxis. But today, our projection is that about 15% of all the patients that are in the U.S., that 15% are adults on prophy. So there's a large opportunity to continue to convert, especially in light of our ADVATE label.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I did have one follow-up on IVIG, I think you mentioned volume growth was up mid-singles. And I was wondering if you could comment on whether that's sort of a sustainable level of volume growth that we can expect over the next few quarters until the capacity constraints ease a little bit. And I guess secondly, just on the geographic transition, how much more of that is left, given where the geographic mix currently stands?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I'd say we're pretty far along with the geographic shift that we are looking to accomplish here. Really started in the second quarter and I think accelerated to a level in the third quarter we'll be at on a run-rate basis going forward here. As it relates to volume, I do believe that mid-single digit unit volume growth is a sustainable level for us as we go forward. As we mentioned last week, we are now in the process of working through the modest refurbishments that we need to do to the older facility in L.A. We've built up enough pace in advance of that to support a mid-single digit unit volume as we go forward. As we mentioned also, we recently received approval in the third quarter in Rieti for the capacity expansion we had coming along -- coming online there, so that will be ramping up. We continue to work to expand capacity utilization in new L.A. So there's a number of factors here that will play into that, but we do think as we go into 2013, mid-single digit volume growth is a sustainable level for us. And as we get into 2014, certainly, with Rieti being a more ramped up with new L.A. reaching hopefully full potential, with old L.A. being back online and the Sanquin deal, then our volume situation becomes significantly better in 2014.","Operator","Our next question, David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping -- on the o U.S. plasma protein trends, is there any connection there between either the country destocking ahead of picking up recombinants or are the 2 at all connected?","Robert L. Parkinson","I don't think so.","Robert J. Hombach","No, David. If you're referring to Brazil. No, the answer is they're disconnected. I think I mentioned actually on the third quarter call, that we are likely going to have some timing differences between tender shipments between the third and fourth quarter, and that certainly has played out even a bit more than we expected. So the fourth quarter timing around tenders is not related to anything over that. Now there is the opportunity to the extent we conclude an agreement to have some participation in recombinant Factor VIII in Brazil in the fourth quarter, and part of our guidance range, I would characterize the year end this year as a bit more uncertain than we would normally see, whether it's mature markets like Western Europe, where governments are under significant budget constraints, and whether there's activity to slow down utilization in the fourth quarter or not is something that we're keeping a close eye on, but also just volatility around emerging markets and year-end shipments. Those are some of the reasons why we've gone with the $0.03 range in the fourth quarter trying to accommodate some of that potential variability, but not related to anything in terms of the Brazil per se.","Mary Kay Ladone","And, David, I would add, the majority of the tender timing is really related to FEIBA and not PD Factor VIII, although that was a piece of it. And the total impact in the quarter on sales was about $45 million.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe for Bob Parkinson, a sort of a strategic question. As you look at this quarter's growth rate, 8% in the United States is probably one of the better growth rates we've seen across all of health care in the U.S. And then, Bob just mentioned pressures in Europe and anything about emerging markets. When you look at your investment priorities, how do you sort of tier them, emerging markets versus the U.S. versus Western Europe? Is it fair to say Western Europe is being deemphasized for those other 2 regions? How do you sort of think about your...","Robert L. Parkinson","No, not at all. I mean, despite the challenging environment in Western Europe, the reality is I think we have opportunities to do better, and we're still making selective investments where there are, what I'll just call, promotional pressure points throughout all of our businesses. I mean, that's necessary to do. The strength in the U.S., both in the quarter and year-to-date, has been encouraging, not sure how sustainable it is quite at that level going forward, as Jean-Luc Butel featured last week at the Investor Conference. Clearly, emerging developing markets continues to be a priority. These are markets that are still commanding a significant piece of our incremental investment, both in infrastructure, frankly, but also promotional focus. And I think these are markets that we have to do better in and I think we will do better going forward. So -- but no, don't assume that because of the challenging macro environment in Western Europe, that we're abdicating that or giving up on that in any way. I mean, it continues to be, as you know, a big piece of our business. And as I said, I think there continue to be opportunities to invest in those markets as well.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And one more on cash flow. Bob, the $3 billion cash flow this year, you've talked a little in the past about headwinds affecting the income statement. That $3 billion, that I think still includes some COLLEAGUE-related costs. How should we think about that going forward?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. We've incurred more than $200 million each of the last 2 years. So I think if you adjust for COLLEAGUE, it would be north of $3.2 billion that we'd be shooting for here in 2012 and certainly we won't have that headwind going into 2013. So cash flow from operations growth, as we talked about in the Investor Conference last week, should be roughly in line with earnings growth. So you should think about growing it off of a slightly higher base than the $3 billion that we're projecting this year.","Operator","David Lewis of Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two quick ones here. I guess the first thing is for Bob Hombach, just looking at the P&L. The gross margins this quarter were obviously very strong, but I guess they're actually the strongest they've been in 3 years. So maybe help us understand, Bob, the underlying factors that are kind of driving you back to where you were 3 years ago and sort of how sustainable you see those trends heading into next year.","Robert J. Hombach","Certainly. Some elements, I think, are sustainable. Some I think were specific to the third quarter. The sustainable piece is strong U.S. demand in our hemophilia business, both for recombinant Factor VIII for ADVATE but also for FEIBA, which is one of our higher-margin plasma-derived proteins. And so FEIBA growth in the U.S. was strong as well. And we think, given the focus that we have both on the ADVATE prophylaxis label and PK dosing but also as Ludwig Hantson mentioned last week, we're very excited about the opportunities that FEIBA prophylaxis could present for us as well. So I think those dynamics continue. The thing that also impacted the third quarter positively for us really is the dynamic related to FX. So as you know, Europe is one of our larger markets and certainly our euro sales are pretty substantial. So the fact that the euro was pretty weak, particularly through much of the third quarter, depressed the sales line. But as you know, we're largely hedged, either naturally hedged or financially hedged, as it relates to the euro, so we're able to preserve the margin dollars even though the reported sales number comes down. So the margin calculation itself is actually benefited, as a result of that, we saw a pretty significant dynamic there. Now just within the last several weeks, you've seen the euro go from the low 120s up to 130, so we don't expect that margin FX benefit in the fourth quarter like we saw it in the third quarter. And it was more than 50 basis points in the quarter from an impact standpoint. We'll see some of that in the fourth quarter, but not anything quite that substantial. So I think those 2 factors, strengthened U.S. hemophilia and the FX dynamic trickling around the euro, are what drove this significant margin.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then, yes, I know you've got questions you talked about the Brazil PD Factor VIII business. But if you think about the European antibody business this quarter, it was down more sharply than we would have expected. I guess, you talked a little bit about tenders, I believe, in the release. But help us understand how much of that is tenders, how much of that could be pending austerity, which we had not seen in the past? And how much of that is just prioritization of global pricing if you have stronger demand in U.S. or other regions?","Robert L. Parkinson","I don't think it's an austerity effect.","Robert J. Hombach","No, David, it's almost entirely the latter that you just mentioned. As we've talked about, we are constrained on a global basis in trying to optimize the limited supply that we have, recognizing that some of our competitors, like Octapharma, have historically had more strength in Europe and wanted to participate in more price-sensitive markets. So we've been actively shifting volume from Europe to the U.S., as I mentioned, starting in the second quarter but really reaching a peak here in the third quarter and reaching what I think will be largely a run rate as we go forward here. So that, really, I think, is the dynamic. There's nothing else significant going on that I'm aware of. We continue to participate in markets where we think it makes sense in Western Europe, where we have a long established position and we think an appropriate price point, and that will be something we'll support going forward. So I think we've largely done the shift that we're going to do.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that was a deliberate Baxter strategy, not end market?","Robert J. Hombach","Absolutely.","Operator","Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So one follow-up here on BioScience. You've upped your expectations for recombinants in IVIG. On the recombinants, Bob, you mentioned, I think, you threw in this competitive convergence comment, I'd love to hear you elaborate on that in addition to conversion to prophy. And on the IVIG side, I guess I would just say help us understand how you're driving some above -- I guess, better than expected growth, improving growth there, against the backdrop of the manufacturing constraints and facilities maintenance you've talked about, and I have one follow-up.","Robert L. Parkinson","Sure. Bob, why don't you handle this?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, sure. So on the conversion front, I think as Ludwig highlighted last week, we had a 2-pronged strategy when we got the label expansion in December of last year. The first was immediately to focus on the improvement in outcomes for patients and reducing bleeds to, on average, less than 1, but overall for up to 40% of the patients or more, no bleeds at all. So we started immediately with that and started to see some conversion from competitive products even in the beginning of this year. And now with the opportunity to more actively market the PK dosing for every 3 day dosing, we continue to be confident we're going to have opportunities there to be very competitive and potentially take some additional share as we go forward. So we're very familiar with this community. We literally know it patient by patient, so we have very good tracking mechanism to understand as patients come on to prophy, are they switching from on-demand from a Baxter product or on-demand from a competitive product or competitive prophy to prophy. So we've got reasonably good visibility there. On the IG front, it's a combination of 2 things, Matt. One is we're running at very, very low levels of safety stock, uncomfortably low, I would say, but the demand has been so strong, we're doing everything we can to meet market demand. And so that has put us in a situation of being on back order on a pretty consistent basis. So we've maybe stretched the volume side of this a bit here in 2012 from our original expectation but the demand has been so strong. But also, this dynamic as we mentioned in the prepared comments and I just mentioned to on other question, the shift from Europe to the U.S., there is a fairly meaningful price differential, from 20% to 30% in some cases, and so that provides some benefit to the sales line from a mix perspective as well. So it's a combination of really doing everything we can on the volume side and getting mix benefit as well, along with the very modest price increase that we talked about previously that we took in the U.S.","Robert L. Parkinson","Just to look back to the -- on the recombinant question, I think it's fair to say that the volume strength is primarily attributed to the uptake really on prophylaxis, which is different than a share shift dynamic. The clinical data on the low bleed rate has been pretty effective in a competitive context, but I think the prophylaxis label has really been the primary driver of the strength today. And as Mary Kay commented in one of the earlier questions, we're still in the early stages of, I think, penetrating the opportunity that exists here. So as we commented, we're quite encouraged about that.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Very helpful. And then a follow-up on Brazil, you talked about a predominantly FEIBA impact in the quarter, tender-related impact. If you could maybe, it'd be helpful to frame out sort of the bigger picture of the opportunity in Brazil. You talked a lot, Bob, last week, about the strategic public-private partnership there that's still pending. But is there an opportunity for these to -- I mean, do you have an opportunity to do something across hemophilia broadly that would include FEIBA and PD and ADVATE? Or should we think about these tender and partnership opportunities along sort of therapies and product lines?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. Well, again, I'm somewhat limited until we finalize the agreement. And as I commented at the conference last week, really, the only reason that I even commented on this is, there has been a local publication on the award that was given, the exclusive award that was given to Baxter. And given that it's in the public domain, I did want to comment on it. The fact that the contract is not finalized, I think we're somewhat limited to offer too many more specifics, Matt, than what we shared last week. But just to reiterate a few things that we did comment on last week, just if there's some callers this morning that didn't follow that, it is an exclusive award, specifically as it relates to recombinant Factor VIII, okay? We think the opportunity is significant. We commented Brazil is the third-largest hemophilia market in the world, with more than, I think, it's about 10,000 individuals, is that right, Mary Kay, that have hemophilia A in Brazil. The intent of the Brazilian government, and this is one of the largest plasma-derived markets in the world is to, in as a short an order as possible, fundamentally convert all those plasma-derived patients to recombinant. So this is a material opportunity. And given the exclusive nature of it, clearly puts us in a position where we're able to establish, I think, the relationship with both the treaters and the patients that should benefit us on other hemophilia-related products over time that are not part and parcel to the specific collaboration. So you mentioned FEIBA, that would be an example. But certainly, future products like Factor VII, Factor IX, von Willebrand's, longer acting and so on, are not really part of the agreement, but would allow us to build on this foundation going forward. So at this point, I think I'm going to stop so I don't share any more than I should. But like I say, when the contract gets finalized, which hopefully will be within the next several weeks, then we'll be very specific. But I think you can conclude this is a material opportunity. And as I commented last week, it's a model, an example of what I referred to as public-private partnerships that support the vector for growth of government collaborations, and I think it can be an example of some things that we're going to try to do elsewhere. In fact, as I commented last week, we actually have active discussions on other businesses with other countries. So stay tuned on that.","Operator","Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with a question.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First off, I apologize. I was caught between 2 calls at the same time earlier so...","Robert L. Parkinson","No, I'm impressed of how quickly you got back in the queue, Mike. All right, go ahead.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I don't really have that much on the quarter. I do, Bob, want to spend a minute on just M&A strategy, particularly in the Medication Delivery side of the business. Could you just talk a little bit about how you think -- you commented on this in a couple of ways at the analyst meeting, but could you just comment a little bit about how you think leveraging certain assets in the Med Delivery portfolio going forward. If the goal is you've got certain strengths, whether it's manufacturing certain types of products, delivery within the hospital, we could go on, how do you think about building that business through M&A over the next 3 to 5 years?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, I would just say I think the Baxa deal that we did earlier in the year probably is a good example of the kinds of things we're going to continue to look at. It's about -- we talk about adjacencies, bolt-ons, we used a lot of terms like that. But any deals that we do have to have what I call, well, I've coined the term, no kidding around synergies. When you do acquisitions, it's easy to position them as strategically compelling and all these words that get thrown around, but there have to be legitimate synergies. The Baxa deal clearly leveraged our channel and relationship with the hospital pharmacy. It became an extension of our strength with premixes to expand in formulated products within the hospital pharmacy. And so whether it's channel, whether it's technology, when you do deals, you have to be convinced that 1 plus 1 is greater than 2. And so I think, in many ways, the Baxa deal, as I said, I think, incorporates a number of the characteristics of the kinds of deals within Medical Products that we're going to continue to target. As I commented last week, I don't see us doing deals really outside of the framework of the businesses that we're in today. In other words, fundamentally new areas of health care, because I think there's enough opportunities in business development and acquisitions to leverage strength that we have in our core businesses, and that includes BioScience, not just in Medical Products, that that's where we want to focus. That's where the value really gets created and the risk gets managed. And there's always risk when you do acquisitions, but that's one of the ways you create a buffer for any risk that's encountered, is that there is a compelling synergy that is deliverable. So I'll stop there, I don't know, Bob or Mary Kay, if you want to add to that. Does that answer your question, Mike? Is that helpful?","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I think it does. There's been some additional commentary in the press in the last 24 hours as well talking about potential targets for you guys. So let me switch gears though. On pipeline news over the next few months, could you just talk a little bit about how you think you'll update the Street, number one, on your HyQ discussions with the FDA as you gain greater clarity there on the preclinical path, will that just come on the fourth quarter call? And then second, just to be clear on your thoughts on how you'll disclose on Alzheimer's?","Robert L. Parkinson","I'm not sure we're going to have anything on that before the fourth quarter call in January.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, on HyQ.","Robert L. Parkinson","Norbert, why don't you -- Dr. Riedel, this is Mike, Norbert, why don't you may be address this and then Bob or Mary Kay can add.","Norbert G. Riedel","So, Mike, we touched on it last week at the conference. On HyQ, we are still planning to request a meeting with the agency by year end to discuss what we have done in the area of additional preclinical data, what else they are looking for. Until we have had that meeting and discussion, it'll be difficult to predict when we will resubmit and actually move towards a review. On other news that you should be expecting this year, I believe...","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And by the way, Norbert, I was talking about after you've had that meeting, what type of disclosure we would expect or whether that would just wait for the -- wait for the 4Q call?","Mary Kay Ladone","I think, Mike, it'll depend on the timing and what opportunities we have to communicate and what type of information we have to communicate. So I don't know that we have an answer today for your question.","Norbert G. Riedel","And on the hemophilia pipeline, I think, as we move forward with our BAX 855, our longer-acting Factor VIII, we plan to have an IND submitted by year end as we mentioned and we will report out on the Phase I data. Typically -- although we haven't done final decisions, typically large symposia like the Hemophilia Meeting would be a forum where we talk about those data. And so it'll be within the format of what we typically do. On VIIa, the same, we will go into Phase III by year end and make those announcements as we actually get the okay from the regulators to proceed.","Mary Kay Ladone","Mike, and I'd add on Alzheimer's, I think it's similar to the HyQ situation. It all depend on what type of information, the timing of information and what we have to disclose. So we've made no decisions at this point.","Operator","Jonathan Palmer of CLSA is on the line with a question.","Jonathan J. Palmer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","For Bob Parkinson, I just want to follow up on a strategic topic from last week's meeting and you touched a little bit on this with Matt's question. One of the growth vectors you discussed last week was this public and private partnerships and we spent a little more time on the Brazilian recombinant deal this morning. My question for you is, how do you institutionalize this objective across the organization and really leverage the portfolio? And is there a formal group responsible for pushing this initiative?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, that's a great question, Jonathan. Well, one of the areas that we've really focused on this year is broadening our engagement and really the global resources focused on what we call market access, which is beyond the traditional go-to-market model of feeling the sales force and detailing the health care professionals. I mean, we've always had gap organizations in place that have established relationships with the government. But locally in the country, but rolled up through the regions as well as in the U.S., we've increasingly, I think, formalized the process that we are becoming increasingly attuned to what the priorities are of the governments who at the end of the day are the payers for most of health care, and then identifying those areas in which we think we can be a viable partner. As an example, and I won't say which government it is, but we had representatives from the Health Ministry here in Deerfield a couple of weeks ago talking about several different issues of priority for them. One of which is a common theme almost around the world that governments are challenged by is how do they manage the escalating costs of treating end-stage renal disease. And increasingly, there's an open-mindedness and a recognition that treating patients in the home not only is more convenient for the patient, oftentimes can lead to enhanced clinical outcomes, but clearly, care can be delivered at a lower cost than a traditional in-center type of environment. So we have, and we will continue to expand our resources, refine our competencies in an untraditional way starting with attempting to understand and empathize with the position of the governments and the payers on what their priorities are and then doing a crossmatch with the therapies that we're in, whether it's end-stage renal disease, whether it's in plasma therapeutics or whatever it may be, where our leadership position, we believe, objectively we present ourselves as a viable partner, and challenge them to open their minds to a different way of collaboration. One of the things that I feel very strongly about is I think, I used this expression last week, necessity is the mother of invention. And I think they need is becoming so intense for governments and payers, it's forcing them to say we have to think about unconventional and different ways to partner with industry if we're fundamentally going to get at these cost drivers that historically, everyone's been frustrated at their inability to deal with. And the traditional vendor-customer relationship where price on the product is the only variable, clearly, we understand why people are focused on that, to try to attempt to drive cost down, but we're reaching floors in that. And so we're really perceiving, in developed markets, an open-mindedness to collaborate in ways that heretofore they haven't. Conversely, in emerging markets, who have the challenge of providing access at what we call the base of the pyramid, which is as much of their population as possible to therapies, they too are looking for ways to finance access more broadly to care. And again, the traditional, what I call Western models of go-to-market, I think have to be challenged and kind of turned on end as it relates to emerging markets. So I'll stop there. I touched on several different elements, but there's a reason we broke this out as a fourth growth vector. We used the examples of the recent Sanquin collaboration, Jean-Luc took the group last week through the collaboration on what's referred to as the PD First program in Thailand. We hope to share more specifics with you shortly on the collaboration in Brazil, but I think these are just the first of what's now going to be a continuing stream over time of collaborations that are going to be significant contributors to our growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just had a question on prophy. Clearly, that's been a great driver for you in recombinants. I wanted to understand, in terms of units, when patients convert from on-demand to prophy. How much of a benefit is that for you in terms of total volume?","Robert L. Parkinson","It's significant. Mary Kay, you want to...","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes. I mean, moving from on-demand therapy, which could be 44 bleeds a year, to prophylaxis where you're taking it, depending on whether you're doing it PK or through standard prophylaxis, either 2x or 3x a week, you're probably talking volume increase of about 2x to 3x the volume.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. I read papers that go -- states from 2x to 6x, so 2x to 3x is helpful.","Mary Kay Ladone","This is weight-based. I wouldn't -- I'd say 6 sounds a little high, Matt, but it is weight-based, so it does depend. It's customized to the patient.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Appreciate that in a difficult market, you guys delivered a decent quarter here. And you talked last week about your long-range plan goals. The growth here was a little bit lower than your goals, and I know you said that it's going to be back-end loaded. Can you help us with sort of the shape of the curve there over the 5 years in terms of how you think the growth is going to be this year and next year and in the out years?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, actually, what I mentioned was during the conference, that it actually won't be that dramatic on either side, about approximately 5. And the dynamics are in the outer years, we'll have more new products contributing to top line and bottom line growth, but we'll also have increased competition, whether it's in the hemophilia space or Factor VIII or in Suprane and cyclophosphamide on the Med Products side. And in the near term, as we start ramping up capacity, particularly in 2014, that will help the plasma situation. But in '13, we're still constrained. So to think about the dynamics around the approximately 5, I don't see a big swing over the 5 years plus or minus around that range going forward.","Operator","Our last question, we have Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital on the line.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Brandon on for Glenn. First, can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of Octapharma regaining footing in the U.S.? Are you still seeing -- still not really seeing Octa in the U.S.? And then also can you give us your expectations for U.S. IVIG pricing as the contracts are renegotiated for 2013?","Robert J. Hombach","Given the strength of the demand in the U.S., the Octa return has effectively been a nonfactor for Baxter, given our product constraints, even though we've shifted a fair amount of product to the U.S. to try to meet this very strong demand. They are still operating with a suboptimal offering of a 5% concentration versus the 10% everybody else has. And despite being one of the lower-priced players in the market, they really haven't, I think, had much of an impact. But again, I think this really is about the strength of demand in the U.S. kind of overwhelming any of these other factors. So it really hasn't hit our radar screen.","Mary Kay Ladone","And we would not comment, Brandon, on IVIG pricing and contracts going into the contracting season.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And also, are there any large BioScience tender that we need to be keeping an eye out for?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, the one that is still pending in the recombinant space is the Canadian tender. And so we have been informed that we have been awarded a portion of that tender that's pretty consistent with our current position in the marketplace. The CBS has asked us not to be specific about the details, but I would tell you that the pricing is pretty consistent what we see in other major tender markets. And so as we go into 2013, that will be a modest headwind. But given all the other factors we talked about, the ADVATE prophy in the U.S., the potential opportunity in Brazil, our opportunity to continue to penetrate other emerging markets like China with approval now and eventually Russia by 2013 with ADVATE as well, we don't think that's going to be a net headwind for the year overall for the recombinant franchise. But other than that, there's no major tenders pending.","Mary Kay Ladone","Right. And I would say Brandon, too, that this is the fourth and last of the national tenders that have played out over the last several years. So we'll be soon approaching a time where we may be participating in these tenders when they're renewed over the next coming -- the coming years, which again, is not included in our long-range guidance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman","Thanks, Candace. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results along with our financial outlook for 2019. A supplemental presentation to complement this morning's discussion can be accessed on our Web site. This presentation, along with related non-GAAP reconciliations, can also be accessed at Baxter's external Web site in the Investors section under Events & News.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our Web site.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth which for historical periods adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for U.S cyclophosphamide, our acquisition of two surgical products from Mallinckrodt in the first quarter of 2018, and for a full-year 2018 approximately 7 months of sales from the acquisition of Claris in July 2017. 2018 operational sales growth guidance adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and generic competition for U.S cyclophosphamide.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Good morning and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to share our fourth quarter results with you today and to discuss our expectations for 2019. I will begin with a quick review of our fourth quarter performance before sharing my reflections on the year as a whole. Jay will then provide more detail on the financials, including our 2019 outlook. We will wrap up with Q&A.","Baxter closed the year with a solid fourth quarter, delivering sales growth of 2% on a reported basis, and 5% on both a constant currency and operational basis. A strategic execution with strong operational performance and disciplined financial management resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.78, up 22% year-over-year.","Drivers of growth in the quarter included the company's Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, Advanced Surgery, and Acute Therapies businesses; increased demand for Baxter's contract manufacturing services also contributed to performance in the quarter. This strength helped offset performance in our Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses, which was in line with the guidance we shared on our third quarter call.","Growth in Renal Care continues to benefit from increased demand for our peritoneal dialysis products globally. In the U.S., we experienced the highest growth for PD patients of the year with patient volumes increasing high-single digits in the fourth quarter. And in Japan, the successful rollout of Kaguya is also contributing to performance with patient growth advancing mid-single digits in the quarter.","In Pharmaceuticals, growth in the quarter was driven by strength across the portfolio globally, increased sales of premixed injectables, anesthesia, and critical care products as well as a strong performance in our pharmacy compounding business, all contributed to growth. This helped to offset expected lower U.S sales of BREVIBLOC and cyclophosphamide in the quarter.","Advanced Surgery achieved growth of 17% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, including a contribution of approximately $20 million from sales of RECOTHROM which benefit from competitive supply constraints during the quarter.","Performance in acute therapies continued to be driven by improving utilization for CRRT globally as well as increased demand for our multi organ support products. Finally, performance in our U.S Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses has stabilized, and we are in the process of executing on efforts to return demand for impacted products to pre-hurricane levels. In addition, we are seeing closer alignment between end user unit demand and financial unit purchases for a large volume IV solutions.","As we discussed last quarter, going forward we continue to expect these businesses to grow in line with their respective market growth rates as well as benefit from new product launches. In addition, last quarter I mentioned that we were taking decisive action to renew strategic momentum in our U.S hospital businesses.","To this end, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Heather Knight will join us as the new General Manager for our U.S hospital business effective February 11. I worked with Heather previously, so I know firsthand that she will bring outstanding leadership skills and superior insights on the medical device market.","On our fourth quarter performance illustrates important progress in our long-term strategic journey, Baxter's emphasis on increasing innovation, unwavering financial discipline, and driving operational efficiency, all contributed to our ongoing growth.","For the full-year 2018, Baxter achieved sales growth of 5% on a reported basis, 4% on a constant currency basis, and 3% on an operational basis. Our overall strength was also reflected geographically, where we achieved mid-single digit constant currency sales growth across all three of our geographic reporting segments: Americas, APAC, and EMEA.","Of note, Q4 represented the highest quarterly operational growth of the year for both our APAC and EMEA regions. Our momentum carried over to the bottom line. Our adjusted EPS was $3.05, up 23% year-over-year. And Baxter generated free cash flow of over $1.4 billion in 2018, up 16% versus 2017. Creating value for stockholders is essential to our business model.","In 2018, we increased our quarterly dividend by 19% and returned over $2.4 billion to investors through our share repurchase program. In addition, the research and development and commercial milestones we achieved in 2018 and the early weeks of 2019 demonstrate a promising future of organic growth through innovation.","Earlier this month, we announced that we had enrolled the first patient in our U.S clinical trial for our in-home, on-demand PD solution generation system. Now, a few weeks later, patient treatments are underway. We believe this technology has great potential to improve the patient experience and simplify therapy management. ","In 2018, we announced a collaboration with the Mayo Clinic to establish a Renal Care Center of Excellence, serving patients across a continuum of care to drive improved outcomes. This will be an opportunity to put our combined expertise to work in new ways. It also represents a meaningful pathway for pursuing other creative collaborations with the potential to advance patient care and drive business performance.","And 2018 also featured a range of pivotal, differentiated new product launches from across all six of our businesses. Our leading-edge PrisMax, CRRT in organ support technology is now helping treat acute care patients in multiple European markets. As I mentioned earlier, the Kaguya APD cycler with embedded share source technology is quickly being embraced in Japan, and is a compelling in-home therapy option. Our spectrum IQ smart pump platform is now being adopted in the U.S and Canada.","And the Evo IQ pump platform is being launched in other global markets. Additional launches across the U.S and around the world include IV pharmaceuticals, surgical hemostats, and sealants and nutritionals. As 2019 unfolds, we are moving ahead at full speed. We are continuing to address unmet patient and customer needs, building out our pipeline and working with regulatory agencies to successfully launch our products across the globe. ","We continue to thoroughly assess opportunities to further our impact to patients and healthcare providers through strategic partnerships and business development. And we remain intently focused on expanding efficiencies across the organization. This all supports our objective to accelerate performance and deliver top quartile results for all stakeholders.","Now I will pass it to Jay, who will walk you through the financials in more detail. ","James K. Saccaro","Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our fourth quarter results demonstrate a strong finish to 2018. Throughout the year we delivered consistent bottom line strength through improved operational performance coupled with the ongoing benefit of our business transformation initiatives.","Moving into 2019 and beyond, we continue to be well-positioned to achieve our long-term financial goals. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results, before providing our financial outlook for 2019. Beginning with the fourth quarter, global sales of $2.8 billion increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on both a constant currency and operational basis. This was favorable to our expectations driven by performance in our Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, and Advanced Surgery businesses.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 22% to $0.78 per diluted share. This also exceeded our previous guidance of $0.71 to $0.73 per share, driven primarily by sales performance, disciplined financial management and a modest benefit from increased share repurchase activity, which Joe referenced earlier.","Now I'll walk you through performance by our geographic segments in global business units. Note, for this quarter constant currency sales growth is equal to operational sales growth for all businesses with the exceptions of our Pharmaceuticals and Advanced Surgery businesses and for the Americas region, for which we will provide operational growth in addition to constant currency growth.","Starting first with sales growth for our three geographic segments. Sales in the Americas advanced 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. Sales in both our EMEA and APAC regions advanced 6% on a constant currency basis.","Moving on to performance by global business units. Global sales for Renal Care were $953 million, advancing 5% on a constant currency basis. As Joe mentioned, performance in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth for PD therapies globally. Partially offsetting this growth was lower U.S sales of in-center HD, primarily related to lower sales of low margin distributed bloodlines.","Sales in medication delivery of $660 million were flat on a constant currency basis in line with the expectations we communicated last quarter. During the quarter, we continue to work with distributors as they reduce their inventory levels. We believe that destocking is largely complete and distributor purchases will now more closely align with end user demand.","With respect to small volume parenterals, we're on track with our efforts to return demand to pre-hurricane levels, as we continue to reinforce to our customers the safety and efficiency of our SVPs for drug reconstitution. Finally, pump sales came in slightly below expectations.","As discussed last quarter, we are seeing a longer sales cycle for Spectrum IQ, given the two way hospital connectivity with the hospital EMR, as well as customer somewhat delaying purchases of new pumps. Despite these dynamics, we gained just under a point of market share in 2018 and expect to gain a similar amount in 2019.","Pharmaceutical sales were $540 million, increasing 9% constant currency and 11% operationally. Growth in the quarter benefited from strength in our anesthesia and critical care products, driven by increased sales of Transderm Scop and Sevoflurane.","Strong sales of Baxter's injectable premixed drugs also contributed to growth in the quarter benefiting from recent product launches. And finally increased demand for Baxter's Pharmaceutical comp -- pharmacy compounding services also contributed to performance. This growth was partially offset by lower sales of BREVIBLOC and cyclo during the quarter. U.S cyclo and BREVIBLOC sales were $39 million and $14 million, respectively, in the quarter.","Moving to Nutrition, total sales were $215 million, down 5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to focus on driving growth recovery through market education and reinforcement of supply availability. During the quarter, we saw a slight pickup in the market and our efforts to regain demand loss as a result of the hurricane are on track.","Sales in Advanced Surgery were $214 million, increasing 17% constant currency and 5% operationally. Sales of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK contributed approximately $21 million in the quarter. As Joe mentioned, RECOTHROM fourth quarter sales benefited from a competitor supply constraint. These issues have since been resolved.","Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $137 million, representing growth of 12% on a constant currency basis. Strong performance in the business continues to be driven by increased global demand for Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapies. Finally, sales in our Other category, which primarily includes our contracting manufacturing services were $122 million, an increase of 14% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by increased demand for our contract manufacturing services.","Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 44.3% decreased 10 basis points over the prior year as the benefit of operational improvements were offset by a certain one-time manufacturing cost in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $597 million, decreasing 4% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by our business transformation initiatives targeted with improving operational efficiency, which helped to offset a loss of approximately $9 million in transition service income received from Shire in 2017.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $165 million, decreased 9% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year as we anniversaried certain milestone and third-party payments made in the fourth quarter of 2017. Strategic investment in our innovation pipeline continues to be a priority.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter were 17.5%, an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Growth was largely driven by operational expansion and continued focus on transforming how we more effectively manage our business.","Net interest expense was $11 million in the fourth quarter and adjusted other income totaled $34 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a benefit from changes in our U.S pension plan and foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions. The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter and as previously mentioned adjusted earnings of $0.78 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.71 to $0.73 per share.","Within the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion or 20.9 million shares of Baxter stock, reflecting our stated intention to strategically repurchase shares trading at a discount to our intrinsic value calculation.","Turning to full-year 2018, sales of $11.1 billion increased by 5% on a reported basis, 4% at constant currency and 3% on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 23% to $3.05 per diluted share. On a full-year basis, we generated free cash flow of more than $1.4 billion, marketing an improvement of approximately $200 million or 16% versus the prior year. This is slightly below our guidance of approximately $1.5 billion, primarily due to a higher year ending inventory balance than we expected.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2019. For full-year 2019, we expect flat to 1% reported sales growth globally, 2% to 3% constant currency, and 3% to 4% operational. I would like to point out some key assumptions reflected in our full-year sales outlook, which included approximately 200 basis points of foreign exchange impact, and full-year's U.S cyclophosphamide sales of approximately $95 million versus $166 million in 2018.","Operational sales growth adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and generic competition for U.S cyclophosphamide in 2019. Operational growth includes the impact and were approximately $75 million related to lower U.S sales of BREVIBLOC as well as approximately $55 million of lower U.S in-center HD sales. Collectively, these two factors negatively impact 2019 growth by approximately 130 basis points.","Moving to guidance by business, on a constant currency basis, except for otherwise noted, in Renal Care we expect growth of 2% to 3% reflecting continued momentum in PD partially offset by lower sales of U.S in-center HD, aligned with our stated strategy of enhancing performance by exiting lower margin product lines.","In Medication Delivery, we expect sales to increase approximately 6%. We expect our Pharmaceuticals business to decline 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for U.S cyclo, operational growth is expected to be flat 2018, reflecting the lower BREVIBLOC sales I just mentioned.","Moving to Clinical Nutrition, we expect sales growth of approximately 3% as we work to return customers in the U.S back to pre-hurricane prescribing patterns. For our Advanced Surgery business, we expect sales to increase 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis. For the Acute Therapies business, we expect growth of approximately 7% to 8%.Finally, in our Other business, we expect sales to decline low single digits as we don't currently anticipate the outperformance in 2018 to repeat in 2019.","Moving down to P&L, we anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of 60 to 100 basis points. We expect net interest expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million and adjusted other income of approximately $80 million to $85 million for 2019. For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% and a full-year diluted average share count between the range of 515 million to 520 million shares.","Based on these factors, we expect 2019 adjusted earnings excluding special items of $3.22 to $3.30 per diluted share. And finally for the year, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion.","Specific to the first quarter of 2019, we expect sales to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis, growth of approximately 1% on a constant currency basis, and growth of 1% to 2% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.66 to $0.68 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open-up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Good morning, David.","Jon Demchick","Hello. This is actually Jon Demchick on for David. Thanks for taking the questions. Would love to kind of dive a little bit into the IV solutions part of the medical device -- the medication delivery business and kind of think about what projections you\u2019re expecting for the first couple of quarters through the year, and how you see the alignment of supply to the financials that you're going to see? Like how much visibility you think is there now today relative to the visibility you saw during 2018?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Good morning, John. We never met, but welcome to our call. I\u2019m going to take the first part of the question and then I will pass on to Jay, who will get into more of the financial impact. Listen, we found now that we're largely the inventory in the chain is largely balanced, meaning that while we see financial results or dollars coming in and the inventory levels at distributors, so sales out to hospitals and inventory is balanced. We saw that throughout Q4, we think that we have a stable market right now, and which made us conclude that we have not lost market share. Our market share is stable and some of the OEM contracts that we had spoken about are coming back a little faster, and we have some opportunities. So what you see in the progression of the quarters is that we have a very tough comp in the first quarter because quite a few remember last year there was a significant amount of buy-in, a tough flu season was the reaction to the hurricane in late 2017. So this is a tough quarter for us to compare, but if you look across the other quarters and for the year, Medication Delivery will be a 6% business, which tells you that this is a well-established business, a stable business. And we have plans to continue to convert that. We have the launch of our new pump coming in. The new pump will drive more stats, will drive more volume and the ability to capture those that will be great. The other thing that makes this quite stable is we are two out of three GPOs signed. In one of them, we are 100% re-signed with the IDNs and we feel very comfortable about our position in the marketplace. Now let me pass on to Jay, who will talk a little bit more of the financial impact.","James K. Saccaro","Yes, just thinking about the IV therapy business, we did have a substantial buy in, in the first quarter of last year. That\u2019s rough -- it was roughly a $15 million positive sales impact in the first quarter. So recognizing this is a low-single digit end user demand that was a -- that was certainly a departure which we\u2019ve discussed in the past. And so as we look at our plans for the U.S business with respect to IV therapy, you will see a decline in the first quarter this year into double-digits. But then as we move to the back half of the year, in the second quarter it\u2019s a more normal quarter, and then in the back half of the year, we do have the benefit of easy comps in large part because -- of some of that inventory coming out of the channel. So really that\u2019s the sequencing that we expect to see during the year.","David Lewis","Okay. And actually guys this is David. I\u2019m stepping in for John. Sorry about that. So two questions for me, Joe, kind of more strategically. And the first one, obviously, is two focus items for investors. The first is fluids, and I think you\u2019ve addressed that for '19 and the first quarter. The second, obviously, is balance sheet deployment, Joe. How urgent are you feeling about deployment in 2019 to sort of get back to 5%. On one hand, I think about the headwinds in your business BREVI and HD, you can almost get back to 5%, just adjusting for those headwinds versus your '19 guidance. But how important is M&A to you this year to deliver your LRP targets in '20? And then for Jay, just thinking about margins, obviously you\u2019ve talked about a margin opportunity of 300 basis points over the next two years guiding to about 50 this year. How good do you feel about the ability to still deliver those margin targets into 2020, just relative to the '19 guide? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Good morning, David. That was well, well orchestrated. So we\u2019ve got three questions out of your call. You said only two, but I will -- those are good questions, so we\u2019re going to answer them properly. M&A, listen, we continue very aggressively looking for opportunities, and I want you guys to think about not on the size base but more so on adjacencies and things that\u2019ll make sense for our company for Baxter. It is -- don\u2019t mistake our aggressiveness in looking for targets with our discipline of really understanding the financials behind the returns for acquisitions, which are unchanged. We are looking for molecules. We have and we require molecules in the marketplace to augment our Pharmaceuticals, we're interested in Critical Care, we\u2019re interested in many other areas that are adjacent to our business. Size is not the priority, but the ability to augment that. Will M&A be a great part of our LRP, we augment our LRP. I still -- I\u2019m still very confident that we have the ability to deliver the LRP. We\u2019ve done M&A at the moment because we have $1.7 billion in new products coming in 2023, and that is still in the plans. If you look at our new product development sales contribution in the second half of 2018, it was great. Now we have some really -- a lot of new products coming in, so we\u2019re confident in that, but I think augmented with adjacencies, M&A, and don't be hung up on size. Some may be a little larger than others, but we\u2019re working intensively. But I want our investors to understand -- I would like to underscore the fact that the returns and the financial returns to our shareholders is very, very important to us, so we would not do a deal that is in the fringes or negatively impact our return to our shareholders. I will pass on to Jay on the balance sheet.","James K. Saccaro","Yes, great. Great. Yes, in terms of margin, but also in terms of actual sales growth, I do think it's important, David, you referenced something. Our operational sales growth this year is 3% to 4%. As you know, excludes the impact of cyclo, but it does include two important impacts. One is BREVIBLOC, we discussed this extensively, roughly $75 million. But then, we\u2019ve also talked about this idea of historically exiting lower margin businesses. I mean, one of the items we pursued is kind of shrinking certain areas where there was little margin in our in-center HD business. But that\u2019s roughly a $60 million impact. So thinking exclusively about sales growth, the 3% to 4% includes within it roughly a 130 basis points of impact that depress it in 2019 relative to the normalized rate of growth we will expect to see going forward. The second item, as it relates to margin expansion, this is one area we\u2019ve been incredibly focused on over the last several years. And this year we will see further margin growth, but I will highlight that this year we\u2019re faced with a number. Of very significant headwinds on the path to delivering this margin expansion. Cyclophosphamide, that\u2019s roughly 1% of margin impact. BREVIBLOC, that\u2019s -- sorry, BREVIBLOC is roughly 50 basis points of margin impact, and I should say cyclo is roughly 50 basis points. And then foreign exchange is roughly 30 basis points. So if we put these items together, we\u2019re talking about again a 130 basis points of headwinds that we fight through on the way to the margin expansion that we will deliver. This year we had a number of headwinds as well. We\u2019ve discussed those in the past and we were able to again deliver nice margin expansion in the face of that. So we don\u2019t point to headwinds as a reason to not deliver margin expansion, but again it does depress margin expansion relative to the normal rate of growth.","David Lewis","Great. Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","David, any handle off for further questions or should we move on? Right.","David Lewis","No, I will stop there. Thanks, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Thanks. Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robbie Marcus","Great and congrats on the good quarter. Jay, maybe I can follow-up on that. The guidance came in, I think, pretty good on the top line, especially considering all the headwinds that weren't factored into street models. But first quarter came in a little bit lighter. So maybe you can walk us through the puts and takes of the cadence through 2019 and maybe some of the product launches or different factors that give you confidence in that second half acceleration.","James K. Saccaro","Yes, Robbie, you\u2019re correct. This is a meaningful acceleration that we will see towards the back half of the year in the back three quarters, I should say. And there are a number of specific items impacting the first quarter growth. So we pointed to operational sales growth of 1% to 2%. But included in that, BREVIBLOC, the biggest impact that we\u2019re going to see is, I believe, in the first quarter. Its roughly $35 million in sales, roughly 1.3 percentage points of growth. The IV buy-in, so we did see a very significant heightened buying pattern in the IV business. I referenced it moments ago. That\u2019s about $15 million or roughly 50 basis points of growth. And then in-center HD, this exit that we pursued is another factor that\u2019s depressing Q1 sales growth. That\u2019s roughly $15 million. So again, as we look at this first quarter growth of 1% to 2%, we\u2019ve almost 2.5 points of sales growth headwinds that are most pronounced in the first quarter of the year. Now transitioning that to an EPS discussion, quite simply $0.05 of BREVIBLOC, $0.01 of cyclo, $0.03 of FX and by the way FX is more of a first half phenomenon than a second half phenomenon. You put these items together and its significantly impacting the first quarter EPS. Furthermore, we\u2019ve a number of benefits that start to accrue to the second half of the year. We\u2019ve the easier comps in the U.S Medication Delivery business that I mentioned earlier. And then furthermore, we start to see the benefit of some of the new products and the acceleration there. Joe -- with Joe in his script referenced some of the great progress that we\u2019re making and we\u2019re pleased really across the board, but it's not overnight that these products come to bear, and so we do see a bigger impact in the second half of the year, on the way to an even bigger impact in 2020.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. One other thing I wanted to dive into is, it looks like the pharma business did very well in the quarter, even when backing out the generic headwinds. I think it's a part of the business a lot of people don't understand the underlying drivers. Can you give us a little bit more insight into what\u2019s driving the outperformance there and how to think about the key growth drivers in '19? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Robbie, the performance is being driven by several factors. Let me start highlighting the success of the molecules that we\u2019ve been launching internally from Baxter, and those are special molecules, not the molecules themselves, but the delivery of the API. And the second is our premix. So premix is the substitute for when we have shortages. We made great efforts to substitute some of our MINI-BAG Plus product lines in the marketplace by premixes and the premixes are more effective and even safer way of delivering the medication and that is doing extremely well. The growth is fantastic. We are moving up 30% plus of growth in premixes. So I know that we both had Medication Delivery and the recap of and recover of our MINI-BAG plus and MINI-BAGS business. But some of that we actually prefer the conversion into premixes which has been extremely success, but the margins are higher by 20%, 30% and we think that that is the way to go. So our Pharmaceutical business is doing extremely well. We have more molecules coming up in '19 and '20. And we feel that that business is finally taking off, ex this cyclo and BREVIBLOC, which eventually will be something of the past and we can move onto the new Pharmaceutical business which is leadership in generic injectables with novel ways of delivering the medication. Thank you. Thanks, Robbie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you and good morning. Just two questions for me. One is a clarification and I'm sorry if I missed this. But are you guys today explicitly reiterating your 2020 operating margin EPS and rev growth targets that you set last year?","James K. Saccaro","Yes, Bob, yes we are. There is no changes to those guidance numbers.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to ask about was just Medication Delivery. We have talked about it a little bit here, but obviously that was a division that cause you trouble for two quarters of 2018. And now your guidance for this year is for 6% growth. I realize some of that is easy comps, but it just seem like a little higher guidance than I anticipated given what happened in 2018. And also given your comments about the tough competitive landscape on the pump side. So maybe you could walk through a little bit what gives you confidence in that 6% from a new product prospective, because even comp adjusted you\u2019re projecting accelerated growth here in 2019.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","So we're definitely getting some benefits from the recapture or the acceleration campaigns with respect to MINI-BAG, MINI-BAG Plus, and then some stability in the LVPs. So the reality is because of the rebates that took place in a number of our product lines, we are able to see above market growth rates in certain product categories. As we referenced in the call, we were pleased to see some of the progress that we made in those areas in -- fourth quarter of 2018, so very, very solid early signs of the recapture campaign paying dividend. And that will continue to pay dividends. Again, above market growth barring the first quarter issue. So that's one factor. The second factor that comes into play is we do start to see accelerated performance on the new pump -- the version 9 of our spectrum pump, which starts to accelerate towards the back half of the year. We have been pleased with the reception of this pump in the marketplace, well received by clinicians around the U.S., so very positive reception. But the sales cycle has been longer than we expected. So as a result of that, we will start to pay that all off in 2019. We have got a line of sight to the pipeline that gives us confidence that we will be able to do that. So you put those things together and like I say, this is a -- this is one where we have a high level of confidence in the acceleration that takes place. And then furthermore, we do have some easier comps in the second half of the year for -- certainly as we look at performance there.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Thank you.","Clare Trachtman","The only other comment I would make there, too, as well is we\u2019re going to see some acceleration outside the U.S as well as we anniversaried some of the comps. As you remember, we took some of that volume to the U.S and now we have successfully -- we are going to successfully bring some of that volume back to those Latin American markets as well.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So the first one I wanted to ask about was the Renal business, that was a little bit of a tick up here and you highlighted now you got all your cyclers is around the world and more people are using them. Can you talk about assumptions for 2019 in terms of any pickup that you could see in PD because of the cyclers? And then, I would love to get a little bit more color on how you're feeling about on-demand PD looking into 2020 and what kind of impact that can have?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","I will take that. Our Renal Care, 2% to 3% is our guidance in 2019. And I just want to give a little bit color why is 2% to 3% and how do we connect the PD patient growth to it. We consciously are walking away from business that were unprofitable in some geographies, primarily bloodlines and was a large volume of product. So our HD business is artificially depressed because our decision -- we were making no money. As a matter of fact, we are losing money in that business and it was a good thing that we are not going to be in that business anymore. Moving to the PD business, we are still looking between 5% to 6% in patient growth. This is a very healthy business. The best geographies in the world right now are North America as well as parts of Asia, Japan and China. We have very successful launch of CLARIA with SHARESOURCE, relaunched in parts of Europe, very difficult time we had with the privacy issues in Europe and now we overcame that issue in many geographies in Europe, and we\u2019re trying to see CLARIA with Sharesource, which is a different cycler. Similar to the HomeChoice here, the old HomeChoice in U.S., but updated with software for monitoring. So that is now been using several different countries in Europe. We struggled in the beginning with the privacy. We got to understand how difficult it is to operate in Europe with software [indiscernible], there's home monitoring, but now that's going well. I will point to Japan, Japan the Kaguya business in Japan is doing extremely well. We already have a 1,000 patients on therapy there. We expect to really accelerate that business in '19 and '20. So expect 5% to 6% patient growth. Very healthy business in the U.S. Our partnership with DaVita is going well, great partner and great customer.","Matthew Taylor","Great. Thank you. And any additional color you can talk about in terms of the pipeline with on-demand PD?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Well, we just have few patients lined up to start receiving the therapy. We have one that is started and he is going well so far. Early to say, but it is something -- this is a very classic Baxter stance. And I would say something we do something. We tend not to say stuff and not do it. So we put our patient on therapy like we promised. We are going to work hard on that therapy. It's complex, because you're making the drug in people's homes, but it's going well so far. And I tell you we are going to have several iterations of this technology going forward, because this is going to be almost a comparison to what the electric car was seven, eight years ago. You start and you started evolving and evolving, and we\u2019re going to evolve this technology. We will continue to be the leaders in home therapy for peritoneal dialysis.","Matthew Taylor","Great. Thank you. And can I just ask one follow-up on the pharma business? You mentioned some of the dynamics before, but I was hoping you could be more specific about kind of the both number of molecules you're launching in '19 versus '20, really thinking about the Claris dynamic there. I mean, should we see some acceleration in terms of the molecules in the growth in '20?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Well, let me -- let's divide this in pieces. We have Claris molecules, which were part of our plan for Claris. And as you know we have the warning letter for the facility, we are doing everything that we are -- we promise to do to the FDA. We will be inspected a couple of times before we can get clearance or VAI for that location. So our focus right now for Claris is to be able to get that facility cleared of the warning letter, and all the efforts that we promised the agency are being done. We also have contingency plan for that plant, because we would like to have Plan B and our Plan B is for most of our products that will be sold in the U.S., we would have CMOs or backups so we can continue operation if something doesn't work. It means that we are working everything that -- every angle that we can to make sure there is no disruption to our plan because the warning letter at Claris. So this is -- this addresses Claris. The other molecules that we have, we have some important molecules launched at the end of '19 and '20, they\u2019re really breakthrough molecules. Not that the molecule itself is breakthrough, but the delivery system of the molecule is a premix and nobody has that in the market. I'm not going to give the name of the molecule, but I'm telling you we have some really interesting stuff going on. The other thing is we have molecules that are launched last year, we have few more launched in this year. The one is a launch last year, I have to say one of them, and I'm not going to give the name of the molecule, is done extremely well with 40% higher sales in our estimates for last year. So that will continue to do well. So our plan for Pharmaceutical is absolutely offset and leaving the past cyclophosphamide and BREVIBLOC and things that were the chief products for the company few years ago were moving into, as we said, we are going to add almost 70 molecules to our portfolio and above double that the ways to deliver those molecules and we are going to do this in a multitude of regions like we promised last year and we are on plan to do it. As I said, we have an important molecule, that hopefully will be launched by the end of '19 and we will announce that properly when that happens.","Matthew Taylor","Great. Thank you, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So couple of, I guess, guidance, housekeeping questions here. Is the guidance assuming any contribution or I guess I should say contribution, the resolution of FDA a warning letter of Claris. And I'm curious, Jay, you mentioned the LATAM business coming back for IV fluids, that happens to be a tender business. I'm just curious have you signed any tenders? Do you have any visibility?","James K. Saccaro","So from an FDA standpoint, there is no resolution assumed in our 2019 numbers for resolution of the Claris warning letter. Obviously, that becomes an important component of our 2020 numbers. So to the extent that we get that resolved along the time frame we expect, then the long range plan that we have are intact with no change. We are looking for mitigation tactics in the event that, that does not occur. But as we look at 2020, that will be an important component for us to get resolved. As it relates to Latin America, yes, certainly there is a different dynamic in terms of tendering in Latin America versus certain other markets. And so, we have moved some volumes back to Latin America. We have clear line of sight to sales performance and where that's going to go. In some cases tenders have been one, but as opposed to going through that in a lot of detail, what I will tell you is we have a high level or a solid level of confidence in our ability to deliver some of the IV sales in the Latin America business.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Jay. Just one follow-up on -- the interest expense guidance. It looks like interest expense is going up. Is there any -- I'm just curious, what is the implication for cash balance or capital deployment just because this is ticking up?","James K. Saccaro","Yes, we have a -- we do have a higher interest expense year-over-year, so that's a few cents of impact. And there is really two factors in play. One is the rising interest-rate environment. But more than that, we have repurchased a significant number of shares. As we said in the past, we have opportunities to buy shares in the market and it's below the intrinsic value, we take advantage of that. In the fourth quarter, we did see a dislocation. We saw fairly meaningful moment in the stock price, but our long-term valuation of the shares was very much intact. We took the opportunity to produce a number of vehicles to repurchased shares. That has a share benefit in terms of share count for the full-year 2019. There is an offset to that, which is increased interest expense. Now as we look at the overall position for Baxter, the net debt situation, we are still significantly below one turn of net debt to EBITDA. And while we\u2019ve said our long-term target is 2X net debt to EBITDA, what I will tell you is I believe we have more -- our main goal is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating and I do believe we have more flexibility than that as we look at further capital deployment. So it doesn\u2019t -- the share repo that we pursued in the fourth quarter really does not impact our business development or capital deployment strategy to any significant extent going forward, but it's a fair point about increased interest expense.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","I just want to, Vijay and folks to underscore what Jay just said, we have said that we were not going to let cash sit in the balance sheet unused. So we are going to return that to the shareholders in a way that we can make the most out of it. So ideally we like to buy more companies and spend money in M&A, but if we don't find the target with the right return, we are going to return money to shareholders in the other two vehicles that we have which are share repurchase and dividend. So I want to make sure that people understand that those three vehicles can be -- are not mutually exclusive. They can be done concurrently, but we will accelerate one versus the other as we progress as I said, money will not sit in the balance sheet unused.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Joe, I obviously caught the comments related to share being stable in IV solutions. I think one concern that investors have is that as we go through contracting process and contract renewals, given some of the pricing around the spot market et cetera, that pricing overall could start to come down. So I was hoping you could perhaps provide a little bit of color and I guess in that maybe some thoughts around just given the tremendous job that you guys have done with creating redundancies for supply, how that also resonates and factors into some of those discussions.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Listen, we were not the benefactors of the spot market sale, because when we end up having -- before we create all this flexibility in our supply chain in Americas, which today is second to none. We have that ability. It's so strong that we can guarantee with penalties to our customers the contracts that we would supply them product, okay? But when we didn't have -- not have that, the other -- the competitors who are selling their product to our customers, were selling sometimes in the spot market with higher prices. So we are not the ones who mostly benefit from that. So I would say pricing in the markets are established by contracts. We have a stable contracts and a stable share. But pricing is a function of competitiveness and that -- so we will always be competitive in the marketplace. But we have what most companies today competing with those don\u2019t have, we have volume of manufacturing, but we have redundancy plan. Think about where we are now approved to sell into the U.S. We can sell our -- out of our plant in the Carolinas, we can sell in the U.S products made in Ireland, products made in Mexico, and products made in Brazil. So we can with the flip of a switch very quickly build inventory contingencies across the Americas, and I think that is a very important position. So how does the price play in this is that, listen, we don't control price other than negotiations which are given -- who are between us and our customers. We did not benefit from this spot markets. So if you are thinking about seeing a decline in price in our contracts in 2019, those will not be there because we're not the ones who jacked up the price for a spot sale and took advantage of that.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, perfect. And just one clarification, and then a follow-up. The clarification is the -- I know you worked hard with the FDA to get clearance for a lot of those facilities to bring supply into the U.S. I just want to make sure that those are permanent approvals to bring supply in. And then the second question, Joe, I wanted to just touch on M&A perhaps in a slightly different way which is, obviously, Amy Wendels come onto the Board of Directors, she is someone that you've worked with for a long time. She has been very, very impactful at Covidien relative to the M&A strategy. And so I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the implications of her joining the Board?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Okay. So listen, going back to the first part of the question and in terms of what is permanent. Mexico is permanent. Brazil is temporary right now, going to permanent after a second inspection that we are expecting from the FDA shortly. Ireland is permanent and we are going to eventually hook up Canada as well as soon as we line up inspections from the FDA. But if you think about Mexico, Mexico is permanent for us, that's a humongous amount of volume that we can bring into the U.S and divert into other places in Latin America as we wish. So there is a lot of flexibility. So Mexico brought -- if you think about a 100% flexibility, Mexico brought to us 85% of flexibility to the supply chain. And the other 15% were brought by Ireland and eventually when Brazil gets permanent importation status, which will happen in 2019.","Lawrence Keusch","Great. And then Amy?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Oh, and the second part, about Amy, well I'm so happy Amy is joining the Board. Amy was a colleague of my at Covidien for many years and work with me for 20 plus years at Covidien. So and -- Tyco Healthcare and Kendall Company. So we go back 1995. She will be instrumental on the Board in helping is not only M&A. Amy is a strategist, is a healthcare strategist. She is excellent in that area and we are very excited that she will be part of helping us with her strategy as well as making sure that our team is in the best shape ever. This is great news for Dennis [technical difficulty].","Lawrence Keusch","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a strong quarter. To exit the year, Jay, I know how much you love to talk about cash flow and not to nitpick on the quarter, but cash flow did come in a little bit under the updated guidepost Q3 for the year. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and what the drivers for the cash flow guidance for 2019 are? Thanks so much.","James K. Saccaro","Certainly, Danielle. Thanks for the question. As you know I do always focus on cash flow, it's a critical number for us. From a fourth quarter perspective in 2018, actually -- it actually was quite a good quarter, right? Operating cash flow growth of 50% nearly and free cash flow growth essentially double and we grew $270 million to over $500 million. So very solid performance. But cash flow is admittedly a number that it's very back end loaded. A lot of the activity, roughly 40% of the cash flow in the year comes in the fourth quarter and a large component of that comes in December. And whenever you try to forecast performance in a month, there is a lot of choppiness to that. And so we -- to your point, we did comment a little bit below our expectations. The reality is there were few factors in play. The sales mix came in a little bit different with more drugs and less devices. Some of the devices that we had earmarked to place in Q4 moved to Q1 with no implications to long-term revenues, solid customer demand. But like I say, it's difficult to anticipate exactly when devices will go out the door. And then the final factor which is an interesting one, is some of our sales over performance came in December and whenever that happens you get the inventory benefits to cash flow, but you don't get the payoffs in the receivable collection even if you have a 30 day DSO, you\u2019re collecting -- if you make a sale in December, it's not going to show off until January. And so, you put all these factors in play, I mean, cash flow did come in a little bit below our expectations. But I will tell you anytime, we grow free cash flow 16%, 17%, which is basically what it was for the year, largely in line with earnings growth and I think it's a decent performance. And so as we look forward, we will have a solid -- we have solid line of sight. What I hope that we have made some improvements to our process to get a better handle on December, but we use the word approximate when we talk about cash flow guidance for this very reason, and it tends to be the most volatile number we forecast. But like I say, our conversion ratios are continuing on to a very good extent. This continues to remain a focus for our entire organization. And in fact, later on today, Joe and I have a meeting with our supply chain team, discussing our -- some improvements to our S&OP process. And we brought in a new leader to this area, supply chain, S&OP process is really the sales and operations planning process that we have at the company. So opportunity there, but, by and large, a very solid cash flow year.","Danielle Antalffy","Great explanation. Thank you so much.","James K. Saccaro","Thank you Danielle.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Matt Miksic of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Matthew Miksic","Hey, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Miksic","Hey, how are you? And congrats on a really strong end of the year. So I couple of clarifications here just on guidance and one on capital deployment. So maybe for Jay, just a clarification on Q1. The color on the 230 basis points of nonrecurring growth items in that 1% to 2% growth guidance was extremely helpful. If I look at that, right, I just want to make sure we are looking at this the right way, this would put sort of growth -- underlying growth, if you will, closer to 3.5% to 4.5% for the first quarter ex those items. And I\u2019m just wondering, if that\u2019s true, just maybe flesh out the impact on the bottom line. I get about $0.05 to $0.07, but anything you could do to quantify that or color around that would be helpful? And then as I say, one question on capital deployment.","James K. Saccaro","Certainly. So in the first quarter, you're right, Matt, BREVIBLOC is $35 million. It's like 1.3%. The IV buy-in and in-center HD are another two factors, adding about 1%. So it is a fairly substantial impact. I will stop short of adding those to the reported operational growth number to come up with this fictitious adjusted number. I don't want to do that, but you can certainly do that to get a more accurate long-term representation of what the growth rate will be. We try to be judicious at using adjusted financial measures here. But then from an EPS headwind standpoint, it's actually more than that, because BREVIBLOC is a $0.05 headwind. Cyclo is a $0.01 headwind. Now that's not included in the operational sales growth number, but it is, of course, included in the EPS number. So that's a $0.01 headwind. And then foreign exchange is also a $0.03 headwind. Now we\u2019ve a number of good guys, things like share count and so on. But like I say, those are $0.09 of specific headwinds to the first quarter that, by and large, are the most pronounced in the first quarter of the year. So you point to we do have a bit of a decline in EPS in the first quarter before we see the acceleration. But really, those are the key factors that impact that. I would say that the IV buy-in is also probably about $0.01 of impact to earnings with the in-center HD is less than that because it is a low margin business. So that\u2019s really the overview.","Matthew Miksic","Okay. Now that's super helpful. And on the follow-up, I guess taking kind of a similar analysis to the full-year, and I understand your organic growth guidance is your organic growth guidance of 3% to 4%. But if we look at the 130 basis points kind of in a similar way, one could argue sort of the underlying growth of your businesses is already kind of tracking into that 4% to 5% long-term growth CAGR that you\u2019ve talked about through 2020, at least and that\u2019s our analysis, of course. But on the strategic front, I just want to confirm and clarify the thoughts on urgency for a deal. I think there's a perception that a deal is maybe more urgent somehow to get to this 4% to 5% growth and -- or whether potential enhancements to the portfolio and growth and so on, strategic investments would be additive to those long-term goals. Just any sort of clarifying thoughts you have on that as we wrap up the call?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Matt -- no Mike. Sorry for that, Matt. I know you\u2019re Matt and now I've called you Mike. Matt, first of all, the worst thing that any of us can do here at Baxter is to rush into a deal just to make sure that it helps us in the short-term. And usually those decisions are bad and ill-conceived ones. We are looking for deals for a while, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve a strong M&A team onboard. But that doesn't mean that we are desperate for a deal, we're not. As a matter of fact, we've turned many deals down. And I can tell you we may -- we did this in the last three quarters. We've turned deals down because financials were not there. We couldn\u2019t make ends meet when we -- but we continue to explore every opportunity. We work very closely with our Board in terms of creating a strategic intent, a strategic drive to bring the deals onboard. It has to be strategic. It has to be accretive. It has to return financially, it has to be a company that will benefit Baxter in the long-term. So if we don't find it, we use the money for something else and benefit the bottom line of the company like we did at the end of '18. But there's no urgency. I want our investors to know that this thing of having to make a deal to make '19 happen or '20 happen, it will help us get even better, but it doesn't mean that we need them. And we will not make stupid decisions to get to the -- to a number just because we have the cash. Thank you.","Matthew Miksic","Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida","Thanks, folks.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Candice. Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter 2017 financial results along with our updated outlook for 2017 before taking your questions.","As a reminder, we have posted a supplemental presentation to complement this morning's discussion. This presentation can be accessed on Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events & Presentations. In addition, I would like to remind you to please limit yourself to one question during the Q&A session so we can accommodate others in the queue.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development, and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will get started by sharing some comments on our first quarter performance, then I will turn it over to Jay who will walk through the rest of the P&L and provide an update on our guidance for the year. After that, we'll close with Q&A.","We opened 2017 with a strong quarter, reflecting continued progress across our three strategic vectors of portfolio management and innovation, operational excellence, and capital allocation. On the top line, Baxter delivered sales growth of 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. Operationally, Baxter's sales rose 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for the U.S. cyclophosphamide market, and the previously communicated selected strategic product exits the company is undertaking. The results were driven by strength across our U.S. businesses as well as growth in peritoneal dialysis, acute renal therapies and nutrition (03:27) globally. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.58 per diluted share. This reflects solid execution on the top line as well as the sustained momentum of our business transformation efforts.","Now, I will walk you through performance by business, and I will be speaking to growth figures on an operational basis to provide a clear understanding of underlying performance. Global sales for Hospital Products were $1.6 billion, advancing 10% operationally. Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $585 million, up 13% operationally. Performance was driven by IV solutions strength in the U.S. along with increased sales of IV access sets, reflecting the ongoing pull-through from our growing SPECTRUM pump installed base.","Moving to Integrated Pharma Solutions or IPS. Global sales were $552 million, increasing 4% operationally. Contributing to performance in the quarter was increased demand for the company's nutritional therapies globally in four (04:43) premixed injectable drugs enhanced (04:47) drug reconstitution systems in the U.S. We are continuing to bolster growth in the IPS business through both organic and inorganic opportunities, particularly in the generic injectable pharmaceuticals.","We remain on track to close our acquisition of Claris Injectables in the second half of 2017, which will greatly expand our marketed portfolio and pipeline. And in the first quarter, we announced a new strategic agreement with ScinoPharm, one of the world's leading API manufacturers to help develop, manufacture and commercialize five injectable drugs used in a range of cancer treatments with an option to partner on an additional 15 molecules. In addition, we are preparing to launch several proprietary premixed injectable molecules in 2017 through our internal research and development pipeline. As we have stated previously, we plan to continue expanding our presence in the generic injectable space.","Moving to Surgical Care, which includes anesthesia and biosurgery, total sales were $334 million, increasing 11% operationally. Performance in the quarter was fueled by strong U.S. growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven primarily by increased demand for Transderm Scop due to a temporary supply disruption in an alternate product during the quarter. Increased sales of Brevibloc, a fast-acting IV beta blocker, also contributed to the growth in the quarter.","The biosurgery business advanced mid-single digits on a global basis driven by double-digit growth internationally of our core hemostat sealant (06:32). As we have previously mentioned, we have increased our investment in this business in an effort to turn around performance. We expect to begin recognizing the benefit of these actions towards the latter part of this year and beyond.","Some recent highlights include the acquisition of Wound Care Technologies Incorporated, the manufacturer of the DERMACLOSE Continuous Tissue Expander. DERMACLOSE is a highly innovative device used to facilitate the suturing and stapling of the skin around moderate to large wounds and represents our entry into a complementary product category. We are also focused on enhancing growth organically. Early this month, we unveiled customer-centric enhancements to both our FLOSEAL and TISSEEL hemostatic agents. They are designed to improve safety for patients and ease of use for clinicians. And in March, we announced the publication of two compelling analyses in the Journal of Medical Economics supporting FLOSEAL as a cost-effective hemostat that may contribute to broader cost savings at hospitals as compared to other options.","Finally, in the Hospital Products sales in our Other category, we were $108 million, up 18%. Growth in the quarter benefited from continued demand for our contract manufacturing services, including our expert thesis (08:05) cytotoxic manufacturing at our J\u00fclich, Germany facility. During the first half of 2017, we expect higher growth for this business as we continue to anniversary the impact from one of our customers bringing manufacturing in-house.","Turning to our Renal business, sales were $896 million in the first quarter, up 2% operationally. Globally, peritoneal dialysis achieved mid-single digit operational growth, reflecting an increasing patient base and ongoing market momentum of our new Automated Peritoneal Dialysis or APD cyclers, AMIA in the U.S. and HOMECHOICE CLARIA for international markets. The success of AMIA and HOMECHOICE CLARIA APD is due in large part to our proprietary shares towards (08:54) telemedicine technology, which recently surpassed 0.5 million patient treatments. In a related development, Baxter also received approval in the quarter for a new KAGUYA APD system in Japan, which we expect to launch later this year. Japan is a market in which we are looking to broaden our presence across the portfolio.","Renal growth in the quarter was impacted by a mid-single digit decline in in-center hemodialysis globally. Positive performance in our U.S. in-center agency business was offset by lower sales internationally due to continued competitive pressures on dialysis. We continue to focus on enhancing the profitability of this business while also stabilizing the growth profile. The acute renal business delivered solid mid-single digit growth globally in the quarter. As we have previously mentioned, we believe the acute market holds substantial opportunity for us, and we are pleased to report that our next-generation leading-edge PRISMAX acute care technology now has been deployed for patients' use in several European locations as part of an initial limited distribution. Clinician and patient response to-date has been favorable, and we look forward to the full European commercial launch in 2018.","In summary, our companywide results for the quarter reflect our focus on disciplined execution to drive improved operational performance. Certainly, our business transformation efforts have been central to margin expansion and we are by no means finished. We are pursuing several new fronts to accelerate these efforts, which we expect will generate incremental savings going forward, a portion of which we intend to redeploy back into the businesses to drive innovation and growth.","The most important point to stress in closing is that we are on a continuing journey, and our results this quarter reinforce our confidence that we are on the right path to achieve our goal of sustained top quartile performance.","With that, I will turn it over to Jay.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results, reflecting continued momentum towards delivering on our long-term financial goals. Sales in the quarter increased 4% on a reported basis and 7% operationally, which was ahead of our expectations, driven by favorable performance in the Fluid Systems and anesthesia businesses. Volume and mix were the primary drivers of growth in the quarter with price contributing approximately 1%.","Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 44.3% represents an improvement of 200 basis points over the prior year, driven by improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio, favorable manufacturing performance, and a benefit from our business transformation efforts aimed at simplifying the portfolio to drive efficiency and reduce costs.","Adjusted SG&A totaled $560 million, decreasing 10% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on effectively managing our expense base to eliminate costs and reduce inefficiencies.","Transition Service Agreement income totaled approximately $20 million in the quarter compared to approximately $28 million in the first quarter of 2016. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. For the year, we expect TSA income to decline by approximately $45 million versus 2016.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $130 million decreased 4% versus the prior year. As Joe mentioned, we expect to continue to ramp up our investments in R&D to drive innovation and augment top line growth.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.4%, an improvement of 590 basis points versus the prior year. Operating margin compared favorably to our expectations driven by improved gross margin and disciplined expense management. Interest expense was $14 million in the first quarter. Adjusted other expense totaled $2 million in the quarter, reflecting a lower benefit from gains on balance sheet positions as compared to the prior-year period. In addition, performance in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from dividend income from Baxalta and gains on the sale of select investments.","The adjusted tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter, which reflects a benefit of $0.03 related to the adoption of new stock compensation guidance. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.58 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.50 to $0.52 per share driven principally by operational strength. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million or approximately 1 million shares. These targeted repurchases were more than offset by option-related dilution.","Finally, before I turn to our updated outlook for 2017, I will provide some commentary regarding our cash flow performance in the quarter. During the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $83 million driven by strong operational performance, disciplined management of capital expenditures, which declined approximately $60 million to $123 million, along with continued focus on improving the company's working capital. This performance enhances our confidence that we are on track to achieve, if not exceed, our full-year objective of approximately $1 billion of free cash flow.","Let me conclude my comments by providing an update on our outlook for 2017. Starting with sales, on a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect full year 2017 sales to increase between 1% to 2%, and on a constant currency basis, 2% to 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact and select strategic product exits, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%. All three of these sales ranges represent an increase from our prior guidance. This growth does not reflect any benefit from the proposed Claris acquisition, which, as Joe mentioned, we expect to close in the second half of 2017. Following completion of the acquisition, we'll provide updated expectations.","We now expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 2% to 3% on a constant currency and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. Within Hospital Products, we now expect Fluid Systems constant currency sales growth of 4% to 5% or 5% to 6% on an operational basis. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions business, we expect constant currency sales to decline low-single digits. We expect full-year sales for cyclophosphamide to total $135 million as compared to our original guidance of $115 million. Our updated assumption is that additional competitors will enter during the third quarter of 2017.","On an operational basis, IPS sales are expected to increase approximately 4%. Within Surgical Care we anticipate sales to grow approximately 3% constant currency or 3% to 4% operationally. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect IPS (16:50) and Other to increase high-single digits. For the Renal business, we continue to expect full-year constant currency sales to increase 3% to 4% or 4% to 5% operationally.","Moving down the P&L, we now expect an operating margin of approximately 15.5% or approximately 200 basis points of improvement versus 2016, reflecting a strong first quarter performance and a lower impact from cyclophosphamide. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to provide updated long-term financial guidance on our second quarter earnings call.","We expect interest expense to total approximately $60 million and other income of approximately $15 million for 2017. For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 21%. This is a slight increase in previous guidance driven by the geographic mix of earnings.","For full year 2017, we anticipate an average share count of approximately $555 million (sic) [555 million] (18:00). Based on these factors, we now expect 2017 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.20 to $2.28 per diluted share. And finally for the year, we continue to expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1.75 billion, and as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, free cash flow of approximately $1 billion.","Specific to the second quarter of 2017, we expect sales to increase approximately 2% on a constant currency basis and to be comparable to the prior year on a reported basis. Operationally, sales in the second quarter are expected to increase approximately 3%. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open the call up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com. And our first question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, the first question I had, I wanted to understand in your guidance what you're assuming for some of the new things like Claris, the ScinoPharm partnership, and the contribution from the molecules that you talked about launching, which is all the injectable stuff.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. With respect to Claris, we have included no impact from that transaction. We expect that the transaction will close in the second half. Upon closing the transaction, we will provide updated guidance, both from a sales and an EPS standpoint. As it relates to ScinoPharm, there is really no material impact in 2017. The large majority of those molecules will launch in 2020, so we have a few years before we start to experience the benefits from that important partnership.","And then finally, from the other injectable products, we haven't broken out the specific sales related to the Carrera (20:56) molecules. What we have said is we expect the original set of molecules to generate approximately a little north $200 million in annual sales, but that ramps up over a number of years. In 2017, the impact is still modest. So, what I would say overall is we're very excited about the generic injectable space. It's an area where we believe Baxter can win and do very well, but we're really setting the stage for that success in the first half and second half of 2017.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, Jay. Thanks for that. And then I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color about what's going on in the Renal business. That's an area where we had expected you might do a little bit better this quarter with the launch of AMIA and continue to see a little bit below market growth there. So, what can get that to pick up, and I guess, what's causing kind of the lower-than-average growth in that segment now?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Matt, the performance of our Renal business in the PD, peritoneal dialysis, and acute renal care is doing very well. And because we are market leaders in both of them, our growth for the vast majority dictates the growth of the market. We have added a good number of patients for the PD business. And AMIA has been a tremendous success in the U.S. As a matter of fact, the growth is at or above what we have said before in terms of market. The issue that we have is simply in-center HD and is focused in Europe for the vast majority. We have had a decent amount (22:38) of competition \u2013 price competition actually in Europe on the dialyzer, and we have plans to come back at that with growth opportunities in Asia to offset that. And our issue in Renal is primarily Europe in-center HD, and we are attentively looking at that.","Just a note on the general business of Baxter, for Europe, we have made significant changes in management and as well as country management. We are revamping that organization and looking forward to the new folks to make an impact. So, that's the area of focus that we have right now. But in terms of the Renal business, not only we are very happy with the PD business and acute renal care. Matter of fact, the acute renal care, we are taking market share in the U.S. as we speak. We continue to convert at a large rate hospitals in the U.S., and the profitability, most importantly, has increased significantly in the renal business. So, we're quite happy with that. So, the focus, as I said, is in fixing Europe in-center HD.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you and your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats on a really impressive quarter here. Maybe the first one, a big picture question for Joe. We've had a number of deals hit the tape recently, a lot of consolidation. And just given your thoughts on portfolio optimization rate (24:26), some of the valuations we've seen here are pretty healthy. I'm just curious how you're thinking of acquisitions, tuck-ins versus even possibly divestitures. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Vijay, good morning. My perspective has not changed about where Baxter stands. We're open to the tuck-ins, and we're doing them, and we're working very hard to get even more opportunities. We have a good pipeline in our pharmaceutical business between partnership and some tuck-ins and even in our advanced surgery, our biosurgery business. With the performance of the company and the work that Jay and Cathy Skala have done in our business transformation process and how quick we are integrating and simplifying our back office, I feel more confident that Baxter could do a 20%, 25% of our market cap deal without a problem, okay? It doesn't mean that we're going to do it, but my confidence has increased in the management of the company in really pulling off something that would be a good deal for our shareholders in terms of bringing synergies to the bottom line and a good accretion to the top line.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","That's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up for Jay. Jay, I mean, operating margins was impressive, right? It really was. But when you look at the guidance of 15.5% versus what you did in the quarter, right, it sort of implies maybe 15-ish in the back half. Maybe the delta is some of this is TSA, maybe cyclo. I'm just curious. Is there anything else going on in the operating margin line? Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Great. Yeah, from the first half to the second half, there were a couple of drivers that impact the operating margin and EPS. And just to run through those, one is cyclophosphamide. From first half to second half, we expect $40 million run rate decline, and so that's about $0.06 of impact. We also expect a ramp down in TSAs of approximately $30 million. So, that's roughly $0.04 of impact. And then the other important thing that we're doing in the second half of the year is we're accelerating some investments in R&D. It's important for us to really set the stage for accelerating growth in the future that has been a core area of focus for us over the last eight quarters. And so, for us, we are ramping up some spending, about $40 million or roughly $0.07 of impact related to first half to second half increases in R&D spending.","The final point I would make with respect to second half EPS, not operating margin, is the tax rate because the primary source of benefit related to the new stock option exercise and stock issuance guideline is a first quarter impact. The tax rate picks up in the second half of the year roughly $0.03. So, interestingly, if you total all of this, we're talking about $0.20 of impact in the second half of the year or roughly $110 million, $120 million worth of pre-tax impact in the second half. So, that's really the drivers as to why we're not seeing the standard rates of growth that we've seen previously in the second half of this year.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, guys. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Joe, you keep raising that percentage. Today, you said 20% to 25% of market cap, the upside size of M&A versus 15% to 20% prior. Is that where your head is at now, that bigger deals are making more sense than maybe 12 months ago?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Mike, you have a good memory, and I'm happy you listen to what I say. We do have more confidence in Baxter. First of all, as a new CEO last year, you're just getting to know the company. You're getting to know the management and its capabilities. No, we have a solid team, a very, very good team, and the execution has been great. So, that gives me confidence that we can do something bigger if the opportunity arises and things are in the right place, and there is value for our shareholders and never compromising what we think is our primary reason in doing deals, which is deliver more value to our shareholders. So, basically, our confidence goes up, the percentage goes up, and I think it's really reasonable to assume that if there's an opportunity, Baxter has the balance sheet, has the borrowing capability, and we feel comfortable with it.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just a couple of quick financial follow-ups, if you don't mind. So, one, you didn't raise your operating cash flow guidance even though you raised effectively your net income guidance by $50 million, and you had a very strong cash flow quarter. So, maybe if you could just shed some light on that. And then second, can you just give us more on what's going on in the SG&A line than what we have so far and maybe give us a sense of head count changes or anything else you can share? Underlying SG&A expense was down 10.5% this quarter. That's obviously pretty dramatic, and it's hard for us outside the company to see some of those changes that are going on.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. First, as it relates to cash flow, great performance in the quarter, and it was definitely a little bit ahead of our expectations. It was certainly ahead of last year, but as you'll remember, Mike, we did have a tax payment last year that distorted the Q1 result. But importantly, the pieces that I think we're pleased with, days payable, we held flat, but days inventory on hand, we improved 16 days roughly year-over-year. DSO was down nine days year-over-year, so this relentless focus on working capital balances is paying dividends, and the teams are hard at work driving a result in this regard.","The other piece of this relates to CapEx where we continue to focus on driving savings where possible, taking a zero-based approach to CapEx and capital spending. The reason we haven't raised guidance, in my prepared remarks, I said our confidence in our ability to beat or exceed guidance has increased. So much of our free cash flow is concentrated in the fourth quarter of the year that it's very difficult to have a line of sight to exactly how payables and receivables will land at year-end. And given the back-end load of cash flow, it's a very volatile number. So, I think for us, we have an improved line of sight, increasing level of confidence. We'll watch this throughout the year, and perhaps if things continue along the current trend in Q2 or Q3, we'll be able to update guidance and provide some updated numbers in that regard.","As it relates to the SG&A initiatives, yeah, I will tell you, we as a team are very proud of the progress that we've made in the transformation of Baxter. We started this in the second half of 2015, you recall, really accelerated the efforts in earnest in 2016. And our business transformation office led by Cathy Skala is focused on a number of important initiatives. One of them relates to zero-based budget. And I will say that in 2017 in the first quarter, we benefited from a lot of the zero-based efforts that we put in place last year related to organization efficiencies, related to spending initiatives. So, really, the primary driver of the benefit in the first quarter was driven by many of these savings initiatives that we initiated last year.","And then the other thing that we've done is for the back-office functions, principally finance, IT, HR, we started an initiative to drive and improve the efficiency of those functions. The most notable area to-date, the most achievement in this area has been led by our IT team. So, Paul Martin, our CIO, and his entire organization have been incredibly focused on creatively driving down the cost of the IT infrastructure. And so, that was one element of driving improvement in the first quarter.","So, those are a few of the highlights I would say. We'll stop short of getting into specific head count. We have delineated this program in detail in our 10-K where we talk about the spending requirements to the program but also the overall savings programs, and I would say that this is very much tracking in line or ahead of expectations at this point.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a quick one on long-term guidance for Joe or Jay. So, as it relates to long-term guidance next quarter, you've been pretty transparent about that. I think investors are very focused on margins, Joe. And I think given your comments on your comfort and transformation, it sounds like we get a material update as it relates to margins. But I wonder if you could talk about organic growth transformation for a second. Have you seen enough from some of the pipeline developments in biosurgery and the continued traction in Renal and Fluid Systems to kind of have a fundamentally different view for how this business can grow in the future from an organic perspective?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","David, I would say that all of the efforts that were put into innovation and the better deployment of R&D dollars and portfolio management are all starting to give us more comfort that our top line growth can be augmented organically towards the end of 2017 into 2018. Those are not overnight programs. Those are programs that take a significant amount of time if you know our products. Even our hemostats, those are long-term studies that need to be done.","But as what I have seen so far coming out our R&D reviews and portfolio business reviews that we're going to start getting momentum towards the end of this year, beginning next year with the things that we started since we started as CEO. I would say that there are some very notable upticks in areas like PD with AMIA and HOMECHOICE CLARIA. We are seeing the launch of some technologies across the board that were not before emphasized by the company such as our extra portfolio (35:48) technologies as well as acute renal care new technology we match (35:51).","So, I would tell our investors that there's a significant focus in innovation, but innovation is the part that takes a little longer, and we see that hitting most in 2018. Our story is one of providing value to the shareholder. We went very hard at our cost structure as well as our efficiency selling products in the market, and you can see that. The Claris acquisition will bring some really good molecules, between 150 to 175. I gave the team led by Robert Felicelli a specific goal that by 2021, we need to have more than 300 molecules in the marketplace as well as understanding and potential pipeline of biosimilars. So, we are just in the beginning of our journey to develop a really strong top line organic growth company. And in the meantime, to deliver value to our shareholders, we're hitting everything that we can in terms of making this company the most efficient and effective in everything we do.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Joe, very, very clear. Maybe just a quick couple of follow-ups for Jay. Jay, just second quarter numbers seem a little conservative. There's some modest comp- adjusted deceleration. It is your toughest comp of the year, but the question is just, is there anything momentum perspective in your mind that really changes into the second quarter or is that just the comp? And then Fluid Systems, really significant upside relative to our number. Can you just give us a snapshot of what's happening with momentum right now between pumps, disposable pull-through, and price? Thanks so much.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. First, as it relates to Q2, to your point, David, it is the most difficult comp of the year. Q2 last year, we had 12% growth in the U.S., so a really strong performance. And we had a very strong pump placement quarter along with strong sales in our Surgical Care area. So, from a comp standpoint, it's a challenging one. I would say there's two other factors in play that are factors that are well understood from our perspective. First is Fluid Systems in the U.S., 20% growth. We do expect that to come down over time as we anniversary certain agreements and as we start to get to a more steady-state approach from a pump placement and sets growth standpoint. So, that 20% growth is not a number that we expect to see for the continued future. That will moderate down.","And then the other factor is, as Joe referenced in his comments regarding sales, we did have a bolus of sales related to a product called Transderm Scop, about $20 million or so of sales in the first quarter. We expect the alternate supplier to be back on the market. In fact, they are on the market, so those sales will moderate down. That benefit will be more muted as we look to the second quarter. So, what I will tell you is, it is, however, consistent with our original expectations from a sales growth standpoint.","As it relates to the Fluid Systems business, 20% growth in the U.S., zero percent, international. If we were to exclude strategic exits, we would see 3% international growth, 12% growth overall, or 13% on an operational basis, excluding the strategic exits. Really, the way to think about that, our infusion systems was high single-digit growth, and really, with the pumps \u2013 it wasn't really a pump story. It was more about the sets associated with the pumps because we had good pump placements in Q1 of last year. And so, we saw double-digit, near-teens growth from a set standpoint. Our whole theory in terms of our pumps business is as we grow the installed base, these sets ride along at a higher margin and helps transform the margin profile of the company. That clearly played out with the Q1 result with the double-digit growth in sets.","And then the IV business in the first quarter in the U.S., we saw very significant growth, north of 20%. And that was very much a mix of volume along with some pricing. So, again, it was ahead of our expectations overall. We're pleased with the progress there and continue to focus on driving sales of the SPECTRUM pump because that's such an important aspect of our overall business.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, Jay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the Renal pipeline and then one on M&A. So, Joe, you've talked about being excited about the acute renal pipeline in new areas, but I don't think you've given us much color on that. And also, can you talk about the point of care PD regulatory pathway? How close are you to getting FDA signoff on that trial? And then I just had one follow-up.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Hi, Larry. The Renal pipeline is one of the richest that we have right now. And we reorganized our company that put squarely under the general managers and presidents of the businesses, the research and development management with people that we brought from other companies to Baxter. It has enhanced significantly our ability to not only develop, put products in the market but also accelerate the clinical studies that we're doing. So, I'll give an example. We're very excited about THERANOVA. We're going to be investing in the next few years $25 million in clinical data because we are convinced and have sufficient data in hand right now that proves this product is superior to any dialyzer in the market today.","When it comes to acute renal care, we have great products for the sepsis treatment. We're going to continue to double down (41:56) in places like Japan and bring that technology on a global basis. And then let me talk about the point of care. A lot has been said by a bunch of different people about point of care and PD and all of this stuff. And Baxter is probably the only company that has the capability to vertically integrate all of these technologies. And to that end, we will be putting our first patient on point of care treatment towards the end of 2018. So, we have a very strong belief, and our pathway is now determined that we can do that. So, that is a great achievement to the chronic renal team that has put that together. So, as I say to the folks at Baxter, go compete for the dollars, go show the best ROIC, and Renal has done a great job so far. I hope the other divisions will follow through, go fight for that dollar that we have available for product development and clinicals.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Joe, that's very helpful. Just one clarification on that and one follow-up. The first patient on point of care by the end of 2018, is that the first patient in your clinical trial or is that when you're basically saying that you can launch?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Clinical trial. Will be first \u2013 a little \u2013 I would say fourth quarter of 2018 we'll have a (43:16) first patient clinical trial. And from that point on, we're going to roll it out as soon as we can in terms of getting the population defined by the agencies in terms of clinical trial. And the launch, we'll be looking at probably towards the end of 2019.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. And then just on M&A, can you talk about the M&A pipeline and why we haven't seen more activity besides the Claris deal? And given the change in the deal size that you talked about earlier on this call, have your targets or areas of interest changed or evolved since you last provided the update? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Larry, this is a very dynamic marketplace. There's a lot of things happening. We have a relentless focus in inorganic opportunities. But inorganic opportunities is now what will drive our company solely. So, we do a very good balance between how much time we spend in looking new opportunities, how much time we spend managing Baxter's current businesses and making sure that all the businesses are performing well. We are every month looking at least 10, 12 opportunities. Some fall off for financial reasons. Some of them have changed in dynamics and performance and situation. With the expansion of our reach in terms of size, it brings a bit more opportunity to the table in terms of evaluating. This doesn't mean that we're going to do the deal, but this means that we're going to evaluate. And one thing Baxter is starting to do very well, we're very fast at evaluating the deal coming to the table, have enhanced significantly our internal capabilities, which are under Andy Kidd who runs the strategy for us and BD&L (45:12) and David Roman who is in strategy as well here. So, these teams have been put together, a significant amount of horsepower. So, we are doing everything we can, but the first thing is if it strategically makes sense, it needs to make sense for our shareholders. The money, when we look at this, this is not our money. We're just here taking care of the money for our shareholders.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good morning. So, I want to ask a quick question for Jay and then a follow-up for Joe. So, Jay, just to start out, obviously, a lot of people looking forward to next quarter when you will give us an update on the long-range plan. In anticipation of that, are there things that you think we should be focusing on in terms of major puts and takes to the long-term plan, things that you'd want to highlight that investors should be considering as we think about the long term relative to your previous guidance obviously?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Look, I don't know that we would \u2013 we have items that are new items to point out with respect to our long-term guidance at this stage. The biggest note I would make is we are certainly ahead of our expectations, and the guidance that we give for this year in 2017 currently sits at $2.20 to $2.28. I believe that's above the 2018 guidance we shared in July of last year. So, a lot of work, a lot of strong momentum. That's probably the biggest change that we've seen in our overall guidance. In areas like working capital or CapEx, we've also seen some improvements, so those would be a couple of other items that we're hard at work in our long-range financial planning process isolating. Beyond that, there's no major dynamic change. We are excited about some of the portfolio items that Joe highlighted in his comments earlier and some of the work that our teams have done from an R&D standpoint, so that should feature \u2013 but again, the biggest impact, those will come a little bit later in the long-range plan.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then for Joe, just on this M&A commentary, I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about your priorities, and two, I guess, two specific questions. One, as you consider M&A, would you consider something that's a little bit more of a white space? And then secondly, on the wound management side, I was wondering if you could just talk about that transaction a little bit more and your interest broadly in wound management as a category. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Hi, Bob. We have four areas that we consider core growth in our portfolio. It doesn't mean that we don't pay attention neither invest in those other areas. We do and we pay a lot of attention to those. But Renal is about new therapies and end-to-end care of our patients. Then we have critical care, which is an augmentation of what we already have between acute renal care as well as our IPS, our fluid management business. Then we have the Baxter Pharmaceutical business, which is to go into generics and eventually into biosimilars, okay, all injectables, cytotoxic molecules, oncolytics, so that's in Baxter Pharmaceutical.","And then you have advanced surgery, which is to complement our product. So, the way we think about this, by defining broader categories within Baxter, allows us to look at spaces that is less singularly focused on product but more focused in areas of care. So, in process of looking at this, we really stumble at opportunities and encounter opportunities that has a little bit of white space in them. At the moment, we are looking at augmentation to support areas of growth for us, not specifically and exclusively in white spaces. We're not there yet. We have our venture capital group here at Baxter where we look at opportunities in white space, but those are at the venture capital level. So, this should give you a bit more color on how we think about deals.","The second in wound management specifically is a natural adjacency of our biosurgery business, which is an adjunct, that knowledge in the OR, are opportunities such as this one we just acquired. It's a small business but goes nicely into our wraps bags (50:08). The wound management per se in terms of traditional wound management, specifically is not an area of interest. As I said, we may come across a company that we like overall products but has that as a small business. It's a different conversation. But to have us specifically targeting wound management is not something that is in the cards at the moment in time. This has to do with wound closure, which is very adjacent to our hemostat and sealing business.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a good quarter. Jay, I wanted to ask you about fiscal 2017 guidance and the incremental guidance on EPS beyond the Q1 outperformance. What segments do you expect to drive incremental strength versus prior expectations there?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. So, as we look at the updated guidance, the midpoint of the range increases about $0.10, and principally, $0.07 of that has arrived in Q1. We expect another $0.03 related to cyclophosphamide. So, really, those are the drivers as we look at the margin improvement on a full-year basis. The Q1 driver, clearly Fluid Systems, had a stand-out quarter. That was an important aspect along with some SG&A savings that contributed ahead of schedule to drive the $0.07. But really, as we move forward, the big change to guidance relates to cyclo. As we look at other factors like foreign exchange, sundry, interest, tax, and share count, they all essentially net out to zero. So, the big drivers are the two that I've mentioned.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just longer term, if we think about Claris and what that brings to the generic injectables business, how does that change the growth profile of that business? That's a global market that I think is growing in the 9% to 10% range. So, curious if you think Claris is something that gets you to within that market growth range, above that market growth range? And then, Joe, you mentioned augmenting existing businesses. Do you feel like generic injectables is now set with Claris and you'll look elsewhere to augment your businesses? Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Danielle, if you look at our long-term objective is to be at mid-single digit growth rate, okay? And the only way to get there in the markets that we are today is to go into a business like the generic injectables, which will change the weighted average market growth rate of our company. So, I would say that Claris will have an impact likely in 2018, and then when you go in 2019 and 2020, they will bring probably 50 to 100 basis points of incremental growth to the company because it's not Claris itself, but it's everything else that will be attached to Claris. Claris has great manufacturing capabilities. In our integration plans, we are already starting to expand a couple of their buildings to put more capability like dual chamber bags and other things there. And so, we are looking at that as a platform. So, I would say that with comfort that 50 to 100 basis points in the midterm growth rate is acceptable. We're looking at Brik Eyre and Robert Felicelli (53:55) to really deliver on those numbers and also to augment our molecule pipeline.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much for taking our questions. So, I wanted to follow up, Joe, I know you've gotten a couple of questions on M&A and strategic thinking on acquisitions. And I guess, one of the questions that we get and we hear in the press, particularly following some of the recent deals, this sort of this idea of scale or leverage on a platform or leveraging your distribution. And you could say the small wound care, wound closure acquisition you talked about sort of fits that on a smaller scale, and specialty injectables kind of in place and your ability to sort of continue to add molecules there, you're talking about a larger deal, I guess. To what degree does growth, does scale, does leverage, does distribution overlap kind of play a role in your thinking? And then I have one follow-up.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Matt, you have to think about what are the major prerequisites for something to get into the funnel. And one of them is be within those four pillars I mentioned before. The second thing is to make sure there is category of leadership in the products that people make and sell. Then once you pass through those broad lenses, it's about what can Baxter do to be a better owner for that business. And if you look at our contract capability in the U.S., (55:45) growth in the U.S., this is phenomenal job (55:47) doing this. So, that is a positive. Baxter is a hospital company, and we are a supply company. We are in every hospital in this country. So, we should have the ability to bring synergy (56:01) in terms of distribution as well as how we manage sales and marketing within the regions of the world because we are effective and very efficient in doing it.","Above and beyond that, the scale of products and the ability to synergize by channel, you have the whole efficiency of cost to maintain the infrastructure, the pure G&A, which I think now we are in a position to really bring a lot of synergies to the table that about a year-and-a-half ago, we were not. So, that gives me confidence that once and if we find the right opportunity for Baxter and our shareholders, we will have the channel synergy as well as the cost synergy.","Now, remember, we always have this conversation about improving our weighted average market growth rate, and that's the only and sole focus of going into businesses on an inorganic manner and to get businesses that have markets that they serve that will be complementary to ours and the growth will be accretive to us. So, once we get those things on the table, we can make our decisions more clearly.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Now, that's very clear. Thank you for that. And then I had one follow-up on just one of your business lines. The pump business \u2013 and I apologize I've been hopping back and forth between a couple of calls, so if this has been asked, just let me know. But your thoughts on sort of the health of that general business. You've obviously done quite well in that in terms of regaining share. Where should we think about that business going from here? And is there anything else in the product pipeline that we should be looking forward to to kind of sustain this growth rate that you've been able to put up?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. We'll forgive you for flipping calls back and forth like that (58:12).","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","So, this is a platform for Baxter. Baxter had this product line for decades in several different shapes and form. We are here to stay. We have this SPECTRUM platform today in the U.S. and Canada, which is doing very, very well. Most importantly is not only the pumps but also the ability to place the sets. And the sets are what continues to deliver on profitability and revenue growth. We have a couple more generations of our SPECTRUM pump coming up in the next couple of years, and then we're going to launch a new global platform that includes different types of pumps that were currently in development.","We're outside the U.S. We have a partnership with a foreign manufacturer where we're going to be augmenting our product lines in Anglo-Saxon speaking countries, so we have the ability to replace our old platform called COLLEAGUE, which is still being sold outside the U.S. in a few countries with a much more modern. But the beauty about our platform on a global basis is our drug library is second to none. And having that being retrofitted in any platform, including the one that we are developing with a foreign partner at the moment, is really important. So, our teams are working very hard. We have augmented our research and development teams across the globe. We have strong center in the U.S. We have centers now in India. We augmented not only with third-party design houses but also our own people in our R&D centers in India. So, we are ramping up to really make this business a leading business in the industry that it competes.","Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, I wonder if you can comment on Surgical volumes in the first quarter. One of the companies that we covered last week came in with better volumes, and they thought maybe the uncertainty about healthcare reform may have pulled forward some volumes into the first quarter. And I looked at your Fluid Systems, up very strong. So, maybe comment on what you saw in terms of volumes. And do you think there was any pull forward in cases? And then I had a follow-up.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Glenn, I don't think there was any pull forward. I think our cycle of sales and growth that Jay had explained here, it had to do a lot with the placements of products that we had early this year and also in the last year-and-a-half. So, we see the U.S. supply business as steady, as low single-digit growth, but it is growing. And we don't see at the moment anything that would create major disruption to the system. Clearly, healthcare reform is up there. And now, they were looking at tax reform and how things are coming along, but I think in businesses like ours where the significant infrastructure products that are used for day-to-day operation of a hospital or a care center or patient care like our PD business, we see that the market in the U.S. is still a good market. The increase of growth is about 2%, 3%. So, we find no disruption in the near term or foreseeable future to that market.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about your emerging market growth in the quarter? And the reason I'm asking is your international results came in a little bit below our expectations, and I know you've exited some business lines, but I'm just trying to search for why international may have come in a little bit lower. Maybe it's emerging markets. So, can you talk about emerging market growth? And has emerging market growth been meeting your expectations, exceeding expectations, or coming in light? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Glenn, once you take out the businesses that we exited, which are all in emerging markets, so we are talking about India, you're talking about Venezuela, you're talking about Turkey. Our growth was 6%, and emerging markets is 20% to 22% of our overall sales. You have an impressive growth in Latin America ex Venezuela of 10%. We had good growth in China, 5%. Remember, we are not in physician-preferred medical devices in China. We are local manufacturer of fluids in China for PD and so specialty fluids or IV as well as nutrition. So, 5% is a good growth in China for those products. Emerging Asia, 5%, and East EMEA (01:03:45), which is all the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa is about 4%. So, I'm quite happy with that. We had to exit those businesses because the profitability profile of them were way below what we had set as acceptable for our company. But ex those businesses, we are pretty good there. The issues that we have in international, some parts of Europe which are underperforming, as I said, we're taking measures to replace management but also to extend product line offerings and clinical trials to get new products in the market there.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you for the color, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

Your lines will remain in a listen-only mode until the question and answer segment of today's call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Candice. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me are today Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter financial results and updated outlook for 2016 before taking your questions. I would just like to remind you that during the Q&A session, if you could please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate others in the queue.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments, and regulatory matters, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting an investor conference on May 9 in New York City. At the conference, we will be providing an update on our strategic and financial aspirations, along with showcasing our innovative new product pipeline at an innovation fair. More details, along with the link to register for the event, can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Clare. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported a strong first quarter, with both the top line and bottom line results exceeding our expectations. I will provide some brief comments performance before turning it over to Jay for additional details and an update on our full-year outlook. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A.","So let's get started. Worldwide sales grew 4% on constant-currency basis and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Operational growth was at the high end of our guidance, and we're pleased with the sequential quarterly improvement in sales growth for total Baxter within both the Renal and Hospital Products segments. Sales growth was primarily driven by strength in U.S. Fluid Systems and PD businesses, along with strong performance in acute renal therapies. They delivered adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share. These results reflect a positive sales mix, continued spending discipline, and some favorability from foreign exchange versus previous guidance.","Let me summarize performance by franchise. Please note that I'll be speaking to sales growth on a constant-currency basis, excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchises, to provide a clearer picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance.","Starting with Hospital Products, global sales totaled $1.5 billion and increased 4%. As planned, first quarter sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide totaled $60 million and were similar to the prior period. As a result, sales of cyclophosphamide did not impact the growth rate for the quarter.","Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales totaled $524 million, up 11%. Growth in the franchise was driven by strength in the U.S., supported by the continued successful launch of the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump, as well as favorable pricing and demand for IV solutions in the U.S. We have successfully renegotiated all of our large GPO contracts, including the recent agreements with HealthTrust. These contracts build upon our partnership with U.S. customers that will ultimately allow us to serve more patients and position Baxter for continued growth.","Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise totaled $556 million, an increase of 3%. After adjusting revenues for a government preparedness order last year, sales in the category increased 6%. Growth was driven by strength across the franchise, including the traditional products, pharmacy injectables, and hospital pharmacy compounding services. This category also includes cyclophosphamide, which as planned did not impact growth in the quarter.","Key to growth in our IPS business is broadening our product offering. Last week we launched vancomycin saline in the company's proprietary GALAXY flexible container, which enables unstable molecules to be premixed and ensures key sterility (5:34) and operational efficiency at the point of care. Vancomycin saline is the second of nine molecules that we'll be introducing over the next few years, and we recently submitted our third molecule for review with FDA.","We also continued to expand our nutrition portfolio globally and recently announced the approval of our NUMETA G13 in the U.K. and Denmark. These markets represent the first of 20 countries where we look to launch this year. NUMETA G13 is a triple chamber parenteral nutrition product focused on meeting the specialized needs of preterm infants. Expanded formulations of NUMETA will help address an underserved market segment.","Within Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, first quarter revenues totaled $305 million, declining 2%. Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower sales of selected noncore biosurgery products and weaker-than-expected international biosurgery sales. Partially offsetting this impact was midsingle-digit growth of both U.S. surgical sealant and hemostasis products, as well as international anesthesia products, where we continued to expand the market and capture share. Baxter is now the market leader globally for inhaled anesthetics. Surgical Care remains an attractive area, and we are prepared to accelerate performance through innovation. In the first quarter, we received approvals for expanded indications for HEMOPATCH in the EU and FLOSEAL in Japan. Both offer great utility among surgeons using these hemostatic agents.","Finally, sales in the Other category, which is primarily our pharma partnering business, totaled $92 million. As expected, sales declined 14% resulting from a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter.","Turning to Renal. Global Renal sales totaled $898 million, up 5%, and we're pleased to see growth accelerate within this business. Performance in the quarter benefited from low double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business as we build on the momentum from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler. The launch is trending better than our expectations, with more than 500 AMIA cyclers sold and more than 100 patients in treatment. The feedback we've received from clinicians and patients has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly with respect to the benefits associated with our SHARESOURCE two-way remote connectivity platform. We look forward to continuing to expand this launch and increasing the adoption of home therapies in the U.S.","A standout from the quarter was global growth of nearly 20% of our acute business, driven by increased adoption of extracorporeal therapies, including Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injuries. In addition to underlying market growth, Baxter's CRRT business continues to gain market shared globally. And in chronic hemodialysis, we experienced low single-digit growth, a positive reversal from the trend we experienced last year.","With good momentum from our first quarter performance, the Baxter team is looking forward to our upcoming investor conference on May 9 in New York. We've recently completed a deep-dive portfolio analysis across all businesses, which has informed us how we must channel our investments moving forward. We're well-positioned to leverage our greatest opportunities and prepare to retool where necessary. I would also point out that we will be hosting an innovation fair prior to the start of the formal presentation showcasing our exciting new product pipeline. I look forward to seeing many of you on the 9th.","With that, I will pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we'll have some time at the end for questions. Jay?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Operational sales growth of 4% came in at high end of our guidance range, and including foreign exchange, sales declined 1%. Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 42.3% compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing, and a lower negative impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A totaled $620 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 13%, reflecting our ongoing focus on controlling spending and rebasing our cost structure.","SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta of approximately $25 million in the quarter. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $136 million declined 5% versus the prior year on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted R&D spend declined 2% as we continued to balance investments in key programs to support future growth while reducing infrastructure-related expenses. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.5% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by the positive gross margins and the operating savings I just referenced.","Interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter. During the quarter, Baxter retired approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt through the utilization of a portion of our retained Baxalta equity in two debt-for-equity exchanges. Following these exchanges, the company's gross debt now totals approximately $3.4 billion, and our net debt totals approximately $1.15 billion. At the end of the quarter, Baxter held 30.5 million Baxalta shares, and we intend to utilize this remaining equity through a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan and an equity-for-equity exchange, which was launched last week. We expect to complete utilization of all remaining Baxalta shares during the second quarter.","Other income totaled $27 million and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $10 million, and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake. The adjusted tax rate was 19.8% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.36 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.28 to $0.30 per share. To decompose this favorability, it was driven by $0.04 of operational strength, $0.02 of benefit from other income, and a lower foreign exchange headwind, which contributed approximately $0.01 relative to original expectations.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant-currency basis, we now expect 2016 full-year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 3%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying growth of approximately 4%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 1%.","We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of approximately 3%, or approximately 5% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. Within the Hospital Products franchises, we now expect sales growth of high single digits for Fluid Systems, driven by the continued strength in the U.S. business. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we now expect sales to decline low single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. Our full-year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide of $180 million remains unchanged, and is based on the assumption that two additional competitors enter the market in 2016, the first by mid-year and the second during the latter part of 2016. After adjusting for cyclo, sales are expected to increase low single digits.","Within the Surgical Care franchise, we now anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we experienced in the first quarter. The growth trajectory for this category is expected to improve as we build upon new indications and geographic expansions. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect the Other category to increase 6% to 7%.","For the Renal business, we continue to expect full-year sales to increase approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses and a stabilization in our in-center HD business.","Moving down the P&L, we now expect an operating margin of approximately 11.5%, a 50 basis point improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting favorable sales mix, disciplined management of expenses, and a lower headwind from foreign exchange. We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $35 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This represents an increase from our original guidance, and it's driven by incremental strength we're observing within our U.S. business. For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 545 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share, as compared to our original guidance of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share.","Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow to now exceed $1.4 billion. We expect CapEx of approximately $900 million, which results in more than $500 million in free cash flow. Specific to the second quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, to increase approximately 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.38 to $0.40 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.","And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your question, please?","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. So first question \u2013 the strength in the Fluid Systems business in the U.S., could you maybe try and break that out between the pump business and the medication delivery piece?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure. We did report a very solid first quarter in Fluid Systems, with approximately 28% growth. And really there were a number of drivers of that. We are seeing continued strength in infusion systems, which is growing north of 30%. A lot of that has to do with pump placements \u2013 or pump sales, I should say \u2013 along with the attendant sets. But, having said all of that, we also had a very solid quarter in IV therapies, benefiting from both volume and pricing. So in short I think it's a combination of factors that led to the solid performance.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And maybe can you do the same for the U.S. dialysis business? Could you just talk a little bit about the difference between the underlying PD business and the other businesses?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, overall Renal in the United States in the quarter grew approximately 8%, and we did see even faster growth in the PD business. As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're off to a great start with AMIA. It's a fabulous, innovative new product for us. It's been very well-received. And so that's one of the factors. But I think beyond that, we are seeing volume and price growth in this important area, and we're pleased with PD performance, which really drives the lion's share of the growth in the quarter.","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","The other piece, Mike, was the acute business, which had very strong growth as well in the quarter.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last follow-up; I'll let some others jump in. The cash flow improvement is obviously important and impressive. Can you just talk a little bit about the plans to rein in CapEx spending, where you stand with that? You're still at $900 million for this year. Without getting ahead of us with the analyst meeting upcoming, can you just talk about where you are in trying to bring in the overall CapEx budget? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure. Look, I think both Joe and I would very quickly acknowledge that 9% of sales for a company of our nature is too high. There are elements that we have to consider as we think about the Baxter business, but there is a clear opportunity for us over our long-range plan horizon to improve CapEx spending and to reduce it to a number that is below the 9%. One thing I would point out, Mike, that we didn't really discuss in detail on the fourth quarter call, is when we were meeting with you all in May, we highlighted $900 million on average for CapEx over the long-range plan, but we did say that the early years would be above the $900 million, implying a number closer to $950 million in the first year of the plan. But we were very pleased with some of the zero-based activity that we did on the CapEx budget to reduce CapEx spending to start the year. And then as we move forward, this is going to be a continued area of focus for us, and our full intent is to drive this down over the plan.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just to complement Jay's answer, Mike, it's not only the zero budget that we did, but also using innovation to replace large capital spending programs that we have. We're looking forward to talk to you folks next week about point of care, and this is one of the ways to reduce large capital spending, primarily for the PD business.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you, Joe.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to start on the Surgical Care business. In your guidance, you've contemplated an acceleration throughout the year from the negative 2% up to the 1% to 2%. Could you maybe just help us understand how much of the drag in the business is coming from discontinuation of noncore product lines versus any other factors that may be negatively influencing that business? And then what specifically drives that turnaround expected throughout the year?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, good morning. The Surgical Care, when you get towards the second half of the year, the comps will help that business, because we're anniversarying some of the negative trends in that business.","I would like just to take the opportunity to make the point that this business has two very distinctive areas. One is our hemostatic sealants, which are doing well. We need to do a better job in the international market, and plans are in place for us to accelerate that with more indications and more focus by a couple organizational change we're going to be undertaking. But more so is to highlight there are a couple categories in that biosurgery business or businesses that were purchased a few years ago that are really laggards and businesses that probably don't fit in our portfolio. Very small product lines, but they are the ones which are dragging the comp on this business. So I want to just reassure our investors that we have a significant amount of focus in this technology. Our base business \u2013 FLOSEAL, TISSEEL, COSEAL \u2013 those are great products and doing very well. And we are looking at a couple of those laggards then to see what we're going do with them.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up. In your prepared remarks, Joe, you brought up that you'd renegotiated all of your GPO contracts, I think in reference to parts of the Fluid Systems business. Could you maybe just put that into perspective for us? What does that mean in terms of the growth rates of these franchises? Does the renegotiated contract provide greater visibility and sustainability of growth? Are there price escalators in there? How should we think about those, just with some context around the overall business performance?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, I cannot comment on the particulars of the contract. I just have to underscore the fact that we're very happy with the signing of our latest contract with HealthTrust. It's a great opportunity for the company. We are market leaders in IV fluid systems, and we're going to continue to be the leader in this market by providing enough capacity to the marketplace. We're being very smart about how to optimize capacity from all of our North American plants to make sure that we have enough capacity for the U.S. market and will not disappoint our customers. This is part of signing the contracts. It's a cycle between three and five years that we always have, and our team here in the U.S., Brik Eyre and Scott Luce, have done a superb job really working with the GPOs and having them see how much of a value Baxter as a partner is. So this is \u2013 but I cannot get into the pricing and arrangements and volume that we have in those contracts.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And David Lewis of Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Maybe one for Jay and then, Joe, maybe a two-part strategic question for you. So, Jay, I mean, for us, the standout in the quarter obviously was SG&A, and I guess if we update for the quarter, your target of 11.5% for the year looks very achievable. Is there a reason why the cost controls, down 13% constant currency in the first quarter, won't hold throughout the variety of the year? Because it seems like if you build on this SG&A momentum, 11.5% looks conservative to us.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, David, maybe I decompose the SG&A performance in the first quarter and then talk about the annualization of that. There are really four main elements that contribute to the $100 million decline constant currency year over year in SG&A. One is TSAs of approximately $25 million, one is pension of approximately $20 million, and then there are two other elements, which I referred to as some of operational controls, that we put in place: restructuring of $25 million and spend controls of approximately $25 million. It's clear we're very proud of the progress that we've made on spending, and I think the first quarter is clear evidence of that.","But as we move to the latter part of the year, there's a couple things to be mindful of. First, the TSA income \u2013 we started recording this in the second half of last year. So that benefit on a year-over-year basis goes away in the second half of the year. And then the second comment is, with respect to restructuring and spending, we did have some benefit in the latter part of last year as we started to implement controls very quickly after the spinoff. And so some of those benefits, it's not appropriate to annualize that performance as we move forward. But it's safe to say cost is a clear focus for us. I think the organization has taken this mandate, and really we are going after this aggressively. We're pleased with the progress, and the first quarter is evidence of that.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And then, Joe, you're obviously having some early operational success here specifically on margins. So I wonder \u2013 kind of two-part question. The first is have your thoughts around pursuing sort of larger M&A this year changed in light of slightly better revenue and operating margin trends? And the second question, somewhat related, is your prior management team seemed to be de-emphasizing generic injectables, but my sense is this management team seems to be reemphasizing generic injectables. So, one, larger M&A this year; and, number two, in that broader medical management business, is generic injectables more of a focus for this team than it was the prior team? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, this is a clear area of focus for us. We talk about M&A, and obviously M&A is opportunistic, but transformative M&A is not in the cards as we speak right now. So we're looking at strengthening our current core businesses, and by doing it, we're going to go into adjacencies.","So why is injectable generics a good area of focus? We have a tremendous technology galaxy in house. We have a good program. We have several molecules for the next three to four years to come. They are in the pipeline, and we're going to accelerate them as much as we can, as those need to be approved by the FDA. But, in terms of technology, we do a great job on that. So the logical extension of that would be to go in an area that is strengthening those core competencies. Now, I cannot speak from prior \u2013 about the prior management's strategic decisions, but when I look at this, I see that as a natural migration of our business.","Now, the competencies to manage a business like that are slightly different, and we're going to make sure that we have that in house. We're going to acquire that to be able to be even more successful. But this is an area of tremendous attractiveness for us, and I want to make sure that we are focused on that. But with all that said, the opportunistic nature of acquisitions will drive how we're going to approach this market.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very clear. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And Bob Hopkins at Bank of America is on the line with a question. Your question, please?","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we can, Bob. Good morning. How are you?","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Hi. Good morning, Joe. Thank you very much for taking the question. And congrats on the good early start. So two questions, one first for Jay or for Joe. On the Renal side, you had a really good growth quarter here this quarter. And so I guess I'm a little surprised that you're not taking the guidance up for Renal \u2013 or at least I don't think I heard that. So can you just talk about the Renal growth in the quarter and why you don't think you'll see better than 3% growth over the course of the rest of this year?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I mean, look, overall we were definitely pleased with the overall performance in Renal in the quarter. And I think of particular note, the acute business, as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, standout quarter. We continue to be very excited about adoption there. We also had a very solid PD quarter as well. But one quarter doesn't a year make, so for us, we're mindful. We have a reasonable forecast in place for the remaining part of the year. And we do have some tougher comps, particularly in the fourth quarter, where in the fourth quarter of 2015, we had a very strong performance in the Renal business. So that's one where I think there's some tougher comps, and we'll continue to watch this. But as we look at the long-range plan that we've shared, acceleration in the Renal business is a very important component of our long-term success. So I can tell you that the first quarter was one that was definitely pleasing to us.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then \u2013 all right, because I just wanted to make sure there wasn't something that falls off in the back half, or some unanticipated hurdles that you want us to be aware of. And so for the second question, for Joe, just to follow up on the previous question about generic injectables. Just curious, as you look around the world, are there a wide range of assets available in that area? I just want to have a better understanding of how much opportunity you think is out there in the world of generic injectables? Are there a lot of assets for you to look at?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, for me, it's not about a number of assets, but the quality of the assets and also, what kind of APIs you're looking to participate. So we are refining the strategy to make sure that we don't have \u2013 we're not after generic, easy-to-make APIs and things that are small. We're looking for high-quality opportunities, partnerships, different to manufacturer APIs, create a little bit of differentiation for us. We don't mind to go into the more common APIs. But you have to have a construct where your business has some barriers for entry in the areas of technology and know-how of manufacturing. So we're looking at the whole spectrum of business. So, again, it's not about the quantity of targets, but the quality of targets.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you, and Larry Keusch of Raymond James is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Good morning, everyone. Joe, unless I missed it, I didn't really hear much of an update on the emerging markets performance for the quarter. So if you could spend a couple moments just walking us through how things are progressing in those emerging markets?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Emerging markets are doing well. We're very happy with the performance in Latin America. Like many companies, we have, in China, seen a overall decline of growth rates. If you equalize for a Renal adjustment that we had in China, our growth rate, you should be seeing towards the end of the year close to 9% to 10%. Okay? So our emerging markets is a healthy business. We right now are focusing in what we call the singles and doubles opportunities, and we just established our \u2013 we repurposed our R&D center, which is a global center in China now, to be China for China. Also very interested in the RTS, our renal clinics in South America. We have some expansion opportunities there.","So our emerging markets is doing well, but we want more from it. We're not \u2013 we're satisfied, but we're not happy \u2013 we're happy but not satisfied, the other way around. We're happy but not satisfied with the performance. And we have some good opportunities ahead of us. We're going to be investing specifically in areas such as China, some parts of Southeast Asia. There's also selected markets in Latin America. As currency weakens in some countries in Latin America, offers an opportunity for potential acquisitions there at a reasonable price, with a good return on investment.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And did you mention what the emerging markets growth was for the quarter?","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Larry, it was about 3% in the quarter.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then, Joe, just one other, I guess, sort of strategic tactical question. There's this thought out there that connectivity between devices and software, between the pharmacy, nursing station, the patient room, is becoming more important, certainly up at the C-suite level. I'm just curious if, a), you do think that's a trend that will continue to increase, and maybe just spend a moment on how you guys think you are positioned there, and are you looking at both organic and inorganic opportunities there?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It is a trend we'll continue. The ability to reintegrate the EMRs with the general floor in ICU connectivity, and connect the patient data with libraries and (35:54), I think it's very important. The importance is not proportional to the adoption. There is a need, but the adoption is not as clear path and immediate as one may make you believe. So, from our perspective, we have a significant effort in connectivity, wired and wireless. And we have two new versions of our pumps coming up in the next three years, but we're also working diligently on a global platform that we're going to probably have more news in about six months down the road.","But we have a significant effort. It's a great opportunity for us. And as we continue to gain market share in our infusion systems, you will see us coming up with new pump versions that will enable that feature. Enabling of the feature doesn't mean that the adoption is going to be there. It just makes sure that the hospital or the hospital system has the ability to connect with the EMR. Not everyone is ready, but we will be ready, as our customers become more diligent about using this feature.","I just want to underscore the fact that our AMIA and CLARIA PD cyclers, both of them operate with a very sophisticated cloud-based system for communication between clinician and patient. So we're already there; we have the technology, and we see the future of Baxter connectivity is enabling our SHARESOURCE technology for also infusion pumps and other devices that may be needed, including our home hemodialysis system, our VIVIA program.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and Matt Miksic of UBS is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. A follow-up, if I could, on the Renal business. And in particular, I think we all on the call and investors following the company understand the profitability opportunity, margin opportunity for pump as you place the pumps and win more business, win more share back, and drive more consumables. There's a \u2013 I think a \u2013 we perceive, anyway, an opportunity to take up margins in that business over time. Would love to understand how maybe some of the same dynamics could play out for Renal, what you see there in terms of improving margins over time, if there's new product cycles or consumables or some geographic trends, would be very, very helpful. Then I have one follow-up.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","From my perspective, we think that there's upside potential in the margins for Renal. And there are different areas. First of all, you saw the performance of the in-center HD business this quarter, and that's the result of stabilization of our dialysis business, primarily in Europe. And as we have new technology coming about, terra nova, we'll \u2013 hopefully will be able to see that trend be steady. So you have natural momentum off that.","The second part is access to the patient. In selected markets in the world, Baxter will make an attempt to connect direct with the patients. I have a great example in Canada, where the government is really into the PD business. They think PD first is a good policy, not only for the patient, but also for the system in terms of reimbursement and cost for the system, 60% penetration in Canada. So there are other opportunities in North America. (40:00) not happy not accessing the patient in North America, so we will have creative ways of connecting to the patient through payers, through providers, to be able to increase the penetration of PD, therefore increasing the future margins of this business.","I have to say that when we look at the acute renal business, that is a phenomenal business for the company, where we're probably going to launch a platform in critical care based on extracorporeal therapies to accelerate even further the growth of that business, with improved margins.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And just to add to that, as you look at the Renal margins over the last year, there's a couple other considerations, less strategic but impacting the numbers. One is we have been investing in a number of R&D programs over the last year, so, VIVIA, AMIA, along with PrisMAX, which are three major platform developments. Those run through the Renal segment's margins. So that's a factor that will go away over time. Related to that, we'll have the benefit of new product launches at a premium price, which will allow us to take margin up in that sense.","And then the final point I would make, just tactically speaking, is you'll recall at our investor conference last year, we did comment that there was 150 basis points of incremental manufacturing costs that we'd experienced in the short term as we looked to address regulatory opportunities for us. That impacted our numbers in the second half of last year and all of 2015, and a large component of that related to the Renal business. We do expect some of these costs to sunset over time. So in addition to the strategic component that Joe walked you through, I think there are a number of tactical elements that will also support margin in this business.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for that. That's helpful color. On a separate topic, R&D, you'd set some expectations for sort of setting the right level for R&D in 2016, and love to understand how you feel about that now. And maybe how some of your thinking strategically, whether it's hard-to-manufacture injectables, plays into sort of how you see that moderating or playing out over time as part of your P&L?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","R&D is a key component for Baxter in terms of innovation and growth. And that's why we're going to be able to show you guys on May 9 our efforts. We're not going to show you everything, but we're going to show a portion of what we think the future holds for Baxter and a significant amount of R&D innovation that is coming through the pipeline. So our commitment to R&D is very strong. We have done and continue to do efficiency programs in R&D, in terms of consolidation of sites and infrastructure. Infrastructure does not provide innovation. What provides innovation are people in the right places developing products for unmet needs and also applications for the specific markets.","And so what you see in terms of reduction in R&D is more of a realignment of resources across the globe, and the right focus and the right products. We're starting to do capital allocations, so we're going to see some movement in R&D. We're going to see some projects that will be slowed down, some that will be doubled down to be able to accelerate.","In terms of hard-to-manufacture APIs, we have some capability in-house, but we always have at our disposal the ability to partner with companies across the globe and acquire companies across the globe. As you know, our balance sheet has good capacity, and we'll be putting that to work for the shareholders' interest. And one of them is the ability to capitalize on our injectable core competences.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, and Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. A big-picture one and then a specific one. The big-picture one is can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the United States and outside the United States as it relates to sort of hospital volumes and your relationship with those hospitals? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Joanne, hospital volumes in the U.S. are healthy. We also need to decompose the growth that we have, because we've been gaining market share in some of our categories, primarily infusion systems. So when you pull that aside, the market share aside, the hospital business in the U.S. is still healthy. Price pressures are always there. But we have much less of physician-preferred products, so we'd only speak (45:11) from products that have high pressure on pricing coming from IDNs and GPOs. We have products that are used on every day, saving lives and sustaining lives of patients, and those products are very stable in terms of pricing, but also the volume is healthy. Despite the fact that on top it we're gaining market share in many, many categories.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then outside the United States?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Outside of the United States, you'll see price pressures in some categories in Europe. Europe is still a low-growth business, not only for Baxter but across a large spectrum of health care. And we see some opportunity in Latin America, and we see some opportunity in China for volume pickup.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. And then my specific question, with VIVIA starting its U.S. IDE, can you give us an update on how that product is doing outside the United States and the timing of when you expect it in the U.S.? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","VIVIA is doing well. We have several patients in Europe. It's a technology that continues to evolve. This is a very unique technology. When you compare it to competitors that say that they have home therapies, they have hemodialysis therapies that are done in the home no different than they're done in the center. Our therapy is done overnight in the home, allowing the patient full functionality during the day for working, productive life.","So if you think about \u2013 this technology's complex, and we keep improving its reliability and its ability to continue to perform in people's homes without a great deal of interference or intervening from clinicians. So the work in Europe is doing well. In the U.S., we're enrolling patients. We have one patient enrolled; we continue to enroll. We have a clinical trial. I think we're a little early to predict the end of the trial and approval in the U.S. We're in constant contact with the FDA. We have a good trial program in place. We'll keep you guys updated as we see needed and we make some progress in terms of enrollment.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Joe or Jay, I was wondering if you could talk about full-year guidance and the drivers of improvement there. I mean, obviously some of the 2Q outperformance flowed through, but you are raising the midpoint of the range even higher than the beat. So wondering if you could walk us through some of the variables that are driving better guidance.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Great. Thanks for the question, Danielle. As we pointed out at the beginning of the year, our guidance range was $1.46 to $1.54, implying a midpoint of $1.50 per share. And we updated it to $1.59 to $1.67, with the midpoint being $1.64. So it's essentially a $0.14 improvement in terms of EPS. There are a number of factors that contribute to that. One is foreign exchange. There's approximately $0.06 of benefit from foreign exchange that we expect to see in the remaining part or over the course of the year. The second piece, though \u2013 and frankly, this is the one that I think we're happiest about \u2013 relates to operational performance. Our expectation now is that operationally, we will be $0.06 better than our original expectations.","And then there's a number of other puts and takes. Interest and other income related to equity gains and balance sheet gains is approximately $0.04, and that offsets tax rate and share count, which is a negative \u2013 roughly negative $0.03 or $0.04. So those are the primary drivers of the performance, but I would highlight that from our standpoint, as we think about the work that we're doing both on the cost side and the pricing, mix side, a lot of those margin improvement efforts that we're undertaking, those are reflected in the $0.06 of operational overachievement that I highlighted.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","And if I could just follow up quickly on the $0.06 of operational improvement, I mean, obviously margins a bit better. How much of it is due to better execution on the sales side of things and\/or improving end user markets?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I would say it's clearly a mix of components that lead to the $0.06, and there's definitely some spending controls that we expect to see as we move forward that contributes a portion. But from an end user market strength, from a pricing and mix strength, that is probably the slight majority of the (50:15) improvement we expect to see over the year.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","All right, thanks. That's very helpful. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And Rick Wise of Stifel is on the line with a question. Please state your question.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Joe, start off with just a big-picture question for you. I know we're going to hear a lot more about it at the analyst meeting. But maybe just share with us some of your early thoughts and your evolving thoughts in these early days. You clearly are busy, you're talking about some management changes, looking at the laggards, et cetera, but do you feel like you're sort of in the place you expected to be? I'd be curious to hear how your thoughts are changing. Is there more opportunity to drive growth in OpEx than you expected? Is there more opportunity to add incrementally than you expected? Just that sort of at-the-margin, your early thoughts. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Rick, as always, we are happy but not satisfied. So there was a lot of work being done by the company before I got here, but I think we're refocusing around a few themes. The first one is a true strategy with disciplined capital allocation. So what programs really going to make through the company and give us big needle-movers. The other thing is to impart the organization to develop what I call the singles and doubles, and have more of a global entrepreneurial approach to the singles and doubles so we can benefit from all of them, instead of funneling everything through a very complex and centralized capital allocation process. So we're doing that. We understand the categories of investment. We understand what buckets, and this is what we're going to talk to you guys next week.","In terms of our cost opportunity, I just appointed a Chief Transformation Officer for the company. He's been with the company for a while, very well-respected, understands the company deeply. He reports directly to me, and underneath this person, Robert Felicelli, we have all the cost transformation, to simplify the company, to understand our back office and how to make more effective and more efficient areas of spending. We're going to talk more in depth next week \u2013 zero-based budget, zero-based spending, zero-based organization. We're going very hard at this, because I think there is an opportunity to free up some real good cash and turn this back to the investors, but also a bit of that turned back into investment programs, to make our company grow faster. So I'm excited. I think the people here are wonderful. We have great talent, and we're highly motivated to deliver to our shareholders and patients.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great. Just a quick follow-up on a more detailed light, (53:18), maybe for Jay. You talked about the early success with the AMIA cycler and 500-plus cyclers sold to date. Just a two-part question there: Is this upgrades to existing systems? Are these new patient starts? And maybe just once again frame the opportunity for AMIA, just a little more granular detail, help us understand what the potential there is. Thanks so much.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, sure. First of all, AMIA is a very new product from our standpoint, so this is a completely new, innovative product that we put on the marketplace. And because of, not only the user interface, which has a high level of simplicity, but also because of the SHARESOURCE technology that Joe referenced, there's a lot of excitement amongst treaters, patients, around the AMIA cycler. So the receptivity for this has been great. Our team in the U.S. has been doing a great job promoting and moving this product forward.","What's happening as a result of the increased value that we're providing is, there is a margin opportunity for us on this product. But what I would say is, over time, we will expect to significantly migrate towards AMIA. We're focused on new patient starts, as opposed to flipping existing patients. That would be too disruptive. But over time, this will be a larger part of our U.S. business. Frankly, in the short term, it's not going to be a \u2013 in 2016, it will not be a huge impact on our overall sales, but over the course of this long-range plan, I do expect this to feature very prominently for our company.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and we have time for two more questions. We have Matt Keeler from Credit Suisse on the line with a question. Please state your question.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Just first on the retained stake, can you remind us what the gating factor is to getting approval to use that to fund the pension? And are you still confident you'd be able to do that?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I mean, look, we are very pleased with the progress on the retained stake. This has gone, I would say, according to our plan. I think frankly, our treasury, tax, and legal teams have done just a fabulous job managing and organizing what is a highly complex process in a condensed timeframe. We've completed two major transactions \u2013 I referenced them: the equity-for-bank line and the equity-for-debt \u2013 really getting the balance sheet to the position we needed to get to. There are two remaining transactions that need to take place. One is a pension contribution, and one is an equity-for-equity exchange, and we expect to be able to do both of these. There is Department of Labor approval that is required as part of this, or I should say, a Department of Labor posting that's required as part of this. And there's a final approval of an S-4 related to the equity-for-equity exchange. And it's safe to say we're working closely with both the SEC and the Department of Labor to ensure all of these transactions can be done in a timely manner in advance of the close.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, thanks. That's helpful. And just changing topics over to surgical care, you highlighted the drag from non-core biosurgicals on growth. Can you just give us a sense of when you expect to start to lap the impact of that?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The second half of the year. I just want to underscore again, our core biosurgery business is doing very well. We have to adjust; in second half, we will have those products anniversarying. Those are laggard (57:00) products; they're not part of our core business, but they were added to the portfolio a few years ago. We just need to find a disposition for these two small products, and they are probably distracting our sales force from even further accelerating. On the development side, we have HEMOPATCH. We have other things that are going on. Launches, we're going to increase our penetration outside the U.S. by creating more indications. We have a healthy pipeline; we have a new oxidized cellulose product that is now being launched in several parts of the world, including Europe. So it's a very exciting franchise that momentarily is having these issues with those two products, but as I said, second half, we'll be anniversarying those numbers.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company. Please state your question.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was hoping to circle back to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions business and focus on the organic growth trajectory there. I believe you've talked about six or eight molecules being launched, yet you just announced the vancomycin launch. Can you just help us frame the organic opportunities with these new molecules? Are these singles, doubles, triples? And just how it can offset headwinds that we're expecting for cyclo over the next 19 months.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have a first phase, which is about eight molecules, but altogether we have much more than a dozen molecules that will come in the next three to four years, probably close to 17, 18. We have all singles, doubles, and triples. We have a third one coming up, I would say probably it's between a single and double, we have a large one in about a year and a half coming down the pike. So we are working very hard to offset, clearly, the cyclo effect, but I want to make sure that you understand that those are the organic products of the company. We also will be very diligently looking for partnerships and acquisitions to supplement that business, because we think there's a great deal of opportunity for the company there as an adjacency.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And if I could just follow up on cyclophosphamide, clearly understand you expect one competitor midyear, another competitor closer to the end of the year. Do you have any deeper understanding of what has been the delay for your competitors? Through last year, only one competitor getting into the market, and now waiting till midyear or the end of the year for a second and third generic competitor. But \u2013 sorry to ask you about competition, but just curious if you had deeper understanding about what's been the hold-up for those generic entrants. Thanks a lot.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We know as much as you do. The company, we put very little resources in trying to understand every single detail about our competitors. It can be regulatory issues. It can be all kinds of different things, ability to manufacture. So at this moment in time, we take advantage of no competitors in the markets. It's a good cash generator for the company. But we understand and we have forecasted the decline of this business, as we have communicated to you. If we don't see any major activity in the future, we'll be the first ones to tell you that the numbers are not changing, or changing by how much.","We're going to be very transparent that cyclophosphamide is not a strategic part of the company. What it is, is a good cash generator, and we're going to use that cash to put that to good use, as I said, in getting into the injectables and double down, triple down, in that business. But anything we know, we're going to make it very clear to you what it is, how much affects us, so there's full transparency in our earnings about this product.","Operator","Thank you.

Before commenting on our performance in the fourth quarter, I wanted to share a few initial impressions of what I have observed during the past several weeks and why I'm excited about the opportunities that lay ahead.","Clearly we're building on a very strong foundation. Baxter has established one of the most trusted and respected brands in the healthcare industry, and over this rich history, we have built a durable portfolio of market leading projects with broad geography reach that spans more than 100 countries.","Clearly, we have an outstanding base for expanding margins and accelerating performance. And following last year's spin-off of Baxalta we can now devote our attention to the strategies and investments that will drive profitable growth across the business and create value as we aspire to deliver top quartile 5total shareholder returns for our investors. The initial steps are already well underway which is reflecting Baxter's fourth quarter results.","As you saw in this morning's release, we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share, exceeding our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Operating income of 10.7% compared favorably of our guidance of 9.5% to 10%. After adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange and a generic market entrant in the U.S. for cyclophosphamide, we reported sales growth of 4% in the quarter, also ahead of our expectations.","Key growth drivers in the quarter included strong performance in our US fluid systems franchise where our newly launched SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump continues to build momentum as well as increase the demand and favorable pricing for our IV solutions.","Performance was also augmented by strength in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business which report the highest quarterly growth of the year. The U.S. PD business is seeing very promising early results on the recent launch of our AMIA APD cycler which features our SHARESOURCE two-way connectivity platform, and we look forward to expanding this launch in 2016.","So overall, a positive quarter and a great base to build on for the future. As for what the future looks like, we are in process of developing a strategic framework that will shape our priorities and direct our approach and investments moving forward. I'm confident this framework will drive a sustainable growth for Baxter and create enhanced value for our shareholders. Simply put, our objective is to further accelerate and increase the impact of our margin improvement plans to support our goal of top quartile shareholder return. To successfully achieve this outcome we will execute on three distinct strategic factors, including portfolio optimization, operational excellence, and capital allocation.","In terms of portfolio optimization, we have taken this passionate approach to portfolio management which we include \u2013 categorize our businesses based on the existing financial profile and future potential. And accordingly, we will reallocate investments based on the ability to drive innovation. In addition, we're intensifying our focus on both R&D velocity and productivity to support our top and bottom line growth initiatives.","The second area of strategic focus is operational excellence. We are aggressively examining our cost structure in terms of how we do business from manufacturing and operations to commercial and corporate infrastructure. I'm confident we can take additional cost out of our business without compromise our commitment to quality and safety. Related to this, we also ensure our capital expenditures are optimally allocated to projects that enhance bottom line growth and support long-term value creation.","And the final strategic focus area for us is capital allocation where we are committed to deploying capital in a manner that creates value over both the short and long-term. We'll be sharing more information about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on May 9 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide more specifics around our objectives along with our three and five-year aspirational financial targets. We know there's a lot of hard work in front of us, but our team is energized and well prepared for the road ahead.","And with that, I will pass it to Jay for more details on our fourth quarter performance and outlook for 2016. Then we'll have time at the end for questions. Jay?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, adjusted earnings in the quarter of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from strong operational performance in our fluid systems, PD, and acute businesses, as well as operating expense savings resulting from our disciplined management of costs and the restructuring initiative we announced last quarter.","In addition, other income from foreign exchange related gains and a favorable tax rate both contributed to our performance in the quarter.","Now, let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2016. Starting with sales, worldwide revenues of $2.6 billion increased 2% on a constant currency basis. This performance compared favorably to our Q4 guidance of a 1% sales decline with better than expected sales growth observed across the portfolio, particularly in our fluid systems, integrated pharmacy solutions, and renal franchises.","Including the impact of foreign exchange, sales declined 7% on a reported basis, and excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and U.S. cyclophosphamide, Baxter's sales rose 4% globally. Sales in the U.S. increased 1% on a reported basis and after adjusting for cyclophosphamide, U.S. sales advanced 7%. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 2% and declined 12% on a reported basis.","Turning now to the drivers of business performance in the quarter, please note, I will be speaking to sales growth on a constant currency basis excluding any foreign exchange impact for each of the businesses and franchises to provide a clearer picture of Baxter's underlying operational performance.","Starting with hospital products, global sales totaled $1.6 billion and increased 2%, and after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide, sales for the hospital products business increased 5%. Within the fluid systems franchise, sales of $569 million advanced 12%. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth of more than 20% in the infusion systems business, supported by the successful launch of our next generation SIGMA SPECTRUM Pump and the related access sets pull-through. In addition sales of IV solutions in the quarter benefited from favorable pricing and demand, particularly in the United States.","Sales in the integrated pharmacy solutions franchise totaled $595 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Excluding U.S. cyclo sales, revenues in the category increased 8% driven by strength across the franchise, which includes our nutritional products, pharmacy injectables, and hospital pharmacy compounding services.","Fourth quarter U.S. cyclo sales totaled $65 million representing a benefit of approximately $10 million versus our previous guidance. For the full year, U.S. cyclo sales totaled approximately $270 million. Fourth quarter revenues in surgical care which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products totaled $346 million and were comparable to the prior-year period.","Performance benefited from low single digit growth of our anesthesia business and core surgical sealants and hemostasis products which both increased in line with surgical procedure volume growth. This performance was offset by lower sales of select non-core biosurgery products.","Finally, sales in the biopharma solutions and other category which is our former partnering business, totaled $109 million and as expected declined 22%. As we previously highlighted, this decline is driven by a large customer electing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter.","As we mentioned last quarter, this category also reflects sales for products Baxter is manufacturing on behalf of Baxalta, which totaled approximately $13 million in the quarter.","Turning to the renal business, global renal sales totaled $984 million, representing an increase of 1%. Performance in the quarter was driven by high single digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business. As Joe mentioned, we're very excited about the prospects for this business which will benefit from the recent launch of our new AMIA PD cycler.","In addition, we experienced low teens growth globally in our acute business driven by underlying market growth and an increased adoption of continuous renal replacement therapy as a treatment option for acute kidney injuries. Growth in the renal business was offset by lower sales in our in-center chronic hemodialysis business resulting from our previously discussed decision to forego certain lower margin sales opportunities along with competitive pressures for dialyzers.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 42.6%, slightly ahead of our expectations driven by favorable products mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $672 million and decreased 17% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, adjusted SG&A declined 11%, reflecting the benefit of the initial actions we have taken to rebase our cost structure and reduce discretionary expenses, and the impact from transition service income we received from Baxalta during the quarter which totaled approximately $30 million.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $158 million increased 2% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis adjusted R&D expenditures increased 9% as we balance increased investments to support our new product pipeline with efforts to optimize our overall R&D spend. Consistent with our portfolio optimization priorities, during the quarter we made the decision to discontinue the development of select programs and as a result absorbed approximately $15 million in expenses related to these decisions.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.7% which compared favorably to our guidance of 9.5% to 10% driven by the positive gross margin mix and SG&A savings I just referenced. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we'll continue to streamline our operations and control spending to drive ongoing margin expansion. Interest expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter.","Last week we executed our first transaction with respect to the retained Baxalta stake. In this transaction, we exchanged approximately 38 million Baxalta shares or approximately 28% of the total original equity stake to retire $1.45 billion of indebtedness under one of our bank lines. Over the next several months, we'll look to further deploy the remaining Baxalta equity through a combination of additional debt for equity and equity for equity exchanges as well as make a contribution of at least $600 million worth of equity to our U.S. qualified pension plan subject to final regulatory approval.","Our goal is to exit our retained equity position prior to any shareholder vote for the Baxalta Shire transaction to minimize the risk of any potential negative tax implications, and we have an agreement in place with Shire and Baxalta to assist with the orderly disposition of the stake. For 2016, we expect these retained stake-related actions to benefit our earnings by approximately $0.15 per diluted share.","In terms of key balance sheet items, after giving effect to the extinguishment of the bank line, our current gross outstanding debt balance is approximately $5 billion, and cash on hand at the end of 2015 totaled approximately $2.2 billion.","Other income totaled $36 million and included a foreign exchange gain from hedges on balance sheet positions of approximately $20 million, and dividend income of approximately $10 million associated with our Baxalta equity stake. The adjusted tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter. This compared favorably to our guidance and contributed approximately $0.02 to our earnings per share in the quarter. The lower tax rate was driven by the extension of the R&D tax credit, a slight shift in our sales mix and certain other adjustments. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.43 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.30 to $0.32 per share.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales on a constant currency basis, we expect 2016 full year sales for Baxter to increase 2% to 3%, and after adjusting for the U.S. cyclo impact, we expect underlying growth of 3% to 4%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to decline approximately 1%. This is driven by growth in the hospital products business up 2% to 3% or 4% to 5% excluding U.S. cyclo.","Within the hospital products franchises, we expect sales growth of 6% to 8% for fluid systems driven by strength in the U.S. business partially offset by the international business where we continue our efforts to optimize our geographic footprint for this franchise.","For the integrated pharmacy solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline mid-single digits including the impact of U.S. cyclo. For full year 2016, we anticipate at least two additional competitive entrants, specifically one to enter mid-year and the second to enter towards the latter part of 2016. As a result, we expect U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to total approximately $180 million, representing a $90 million year-over-year decline. Sales for the category after adjusting for cyclophosphamide are expected to be comparable to prior years.","I would also remind you that in the 2015, we recognized approximately $40 million in government sales for PROTOPAM. Given the purchasing pattern associated with this product, we do not anticipate any sales in 2016 in IPS.","Within the surgical care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 2% to 3%. And finally, for the hospital products business, we expect the other category, which includes our biopharma solutions franchise, to increase low-double digits as we anniversary the impact of our customer transitioning their manufacturing in-house. This also reflects an incremental year-over-year benefit of approximately $25 million associated with contract manufacturing revenues from Baxalta.","For the renal business, we expect full year sales to increase approximately 3% driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses and a stabilization in our in-center HD business.","Moving down the P&L, we expect an operating margin of approximately 11%, which compares favorably to the guidance we provided at our 2015 May Investor Conference of approximately 10%. We expect interest expense to total approximately $90 million. This reflects the recent extinguishment of our bank line along with additional debt repayment based on further utilization of the retained stake.","For 2016, we expect modest other income of approximately $10 million. This represents a year-over-year decline of approximately $150 million. In 2015, we benefited from certain balance sheet hedge gains and select equity gains related to our Baxter Ventures portfolio, neither of which is planned to repeat in 2016.","For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of 19.5% to 20%. This represents an increase from 2015 driven primarily by the change in earnings mix. For 2016, we anticipate an average share count of approximately 540 million shares. This reduction is driven by equity-for-equity exchanges that we anticipate to execute as part of our retained stake strategy later in second quarter.","Please note that our interest expense and share count guidance reflects a preliminary base case retained stake execution plan and is subject to change as we reassess the optimal size and mix of our remaining transactions as market and other conditions evolve. We anticipate providing updates to our guidance and\/or additional detail around the actual impacts of our retained stake transactions as appropriate as we move forward.","Based on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $1.46 to $1.54 per diluted share for 2016. Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million resulting in free cash flow for 2016 of approximately $500 million. This is also favorable to the guidance we provided in May.","Specific to the first quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to decline approximately 2%, and we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International's website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, Joe. Good to hear your voice again here. I want to just start with one strategic question and then one follow up on the financial side. And, Joe, I imagine you'll get into this in more detail come May, but maybe you could just start from a top-down perspective in where are you ultimately hoping to take Baxter. As I sort of think about the profile of the business today, relatively low-single digit top line growth, room for margin expansion, how do you want the business to be perceived, and where do you ultimately want to take the story over time?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, I don't want to preempt our meeting in May, but I will give you a few things that we're considering very seriously. First of all is taking from the top, we need to alter the weighted average market growth rate of our businesses. By doing that, we will look at some organic programs that can help us get into some adjacent markets and also some acquisitions. When also we look at execution, we need to continue to improve our execution on a global basis and make sure that we are in the right businesses around the globe. Being global is not to be all over the place, so we need to make sure that we're focusing in countries and geographies for businesses that make sense. So all this work is in process as we speak.","When I look at on the cost base and expense, we want to take the company to a rebase exercise, cost rebase, and find out what is the appropriate level of support that we need to maintain our company and provide for continuous improvement and operational excellence programs that will deliver better results than we have spoken about in terms of operating income back in May last year. So we are working very diligently right now in creating this strategic framework. We're working on our portfolio initiatives. But we understand some of these initiatives on the top line take a little longer, and I have no issues augmenting that with some acquisitions, and I have no problems accelerating our cost reduction rebasing the cost of the company to be able to create momentum until we can get the innovation machine reignited again.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just on the financial side. Jay, maybe you can sort of help us talk through the difference between the 10% operating margin guidance that you provided at last May's analyst meeting and the 11% that you're presenting today for 2016? What are some of the factors that influenced the 100 basis point better performance?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Great. So there are a number of different variables that have impacted our performance since we sat together in the May. I'll highlight maybe the four most significant. As David pointed out, we guided to an operating margin of 10% for 2016. Obviously, we're very pleased to report our expectations now are an 11% operating income margin. One of the key drivers relates to foreign exchange. The foreign exchange environment since May has moved very significantly. We can talk later about EPS impacts, but from an operating margin impact relative to our May expectations, we're down about 1.4% in terms of margin impact due to foreign exchange.","As you'll recall, in the second half of the year, a lot of the emerging markets currencies moved while the developing markets currencies stabilized, and for us because we don't hedge emerging market currencies it did have a 1.4% impact on our overall margin. We did have higher than expected cyclo in 2016. So as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we'll achieve about $180 million of cyclo sales in 2016. That's roughly 1 percentage point higher than we expected. We also have positive pension. There are a number of impacts that we have with respect to our pension, some of which we had anticipated in part related to the contribution of the retained stake, but some of which we did not anticipate, and that's about 60 basis points of improvement as we move to 2016.","But I will tell you the area that's most important as we look at the stability of the operations from my perspective relates to the operational performance and OpEx savings which contribute about a point of margin improvement relative to our May investor conference expectations. So those are the four factors. With cyclo and pension, essentially offsetting FX and then the over achievement really, in my view, coming from operational strength.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for all the detail.","Operator","Our next...","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Go ahead, Stephanie.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, Joe, just a couple of questions here. I'll start with strategic for Joe and then a follow-up maybe for Jay. Joe, just \u2013 I know we're not going to get a lot of commentary before May, but just very broadly, I know you've only been there a short period of time, kind of a couple of questions for you. The first is how do you see the balance of pursuing large M&A in the near term versus delivering your organic margin plan? And if you think specifically about your hospital business and the four segments there, do you have a sense of which segments are likely to see further investment versus which ones are likely to be optimized for return or cash? And then a quick follow-up for Jay.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, David. We almost there are completing that analysis. We've put our portfolio through about five different filters, and we actually have a pretty good idea of the things that we will invest for top line growth versus ROIC and ones that are strategic bets and ones that we're going to manage more for cash. I would say to you. I'm going to give a few examples. We have a very good IPS business, the integrated pharmacy solutions is a very good business, and it's something that we probably can double down as an example. We will be making organic investments, possibly inorganic investments.","I just want to circle back to your comment about large size M&A. When we go down this path and we look at inorganic opportunities, size is not what matters but the ability, the ability to change the weighted average market growth rate of our businesses is key to us. And those acquisitions will be singles and doubles. They will not be big things in one shot. We're going to make right decisions with our shareholders' money. And we need to balance that well, but we need to make sure also that we can successfully integrate and generate a step change in how we grow that business that we acquired. So we'll be focusing great deal of our attention in the value the business brings to us strategic, but IPS is a good place to start.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then Jay, just on fluid systems, it was the driver obviously in the quarter and it does seem to be the principal driver for next year's acceleration. Can you give us a component right now, what principally is driving the success? I know it's capital and consumable, but can you give us a sense of how large of a role capital sales are playing in 2016 and any sense of backlog in terms of sustainability of those capital sales over the next couple of years? Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, sure. I mean, look, fluid systems really has two primary drivers of growth in the fourth quarter, and then also as we move to next year we'll see similar levels of performance based on those two drivers. And the first one, I would say, is the infusion systems business. In particular, in the U.S. we had well north of 20% growth in our infusion systems business. And breaking that down, there's two components of that. One is the sale of the SPECTRUM Pump, which has recently relaunched, and that clearly is capital related. But as I think about the long-term sustainability of the business, really we were very pleased with the sets associated with that. And so we had very strong performance in set sales as well, well into double digits. So those were the two drivers on the infusion systems side.","From an IV therapy standpoint, we've commented previously about the marketplace conditions, some of the actions that we've taken and also continued demand for this important product. And so we did report very solid growth in the IV therapy business as well, well into double digits.","And so in combination these items contributed to -- in the U.S. and my growth rates are in relation to the U.S. -- the fluid systems growth that we reported of 27%. So clearly this was a bright spot for us. We do expect this to continue, but of course not at the Q4 rates. So we'll see some moderation as we move to the 2016 plan. So overall very pleased with it. Some of it is related to capital spending but, as you know, most hospitals have lacked for many years an attractive alternative from a pump standpoint for a variety of different reasons. So we do believe there is some level of pent-up demand. We have a fairly good line of sight to the sales plan for 2016, so this is an area that I think is really one of the growth drivers for Baxter in 2016 and beyond.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Jay, just want to circle back to a couple of the line items in the guidance. The share count guidance seems to imply that you're going to use $1 billion of the retained \u2013 the remaining Baxalta stake in the stock for stock exchanges. Is that about right in terms of \u2013 is that about what you're applying in your assumptions for 2016? And if so, why is that the right mix in terms of what remains?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, Mike, maybe I'll take a step back and address the retained stake overall to address your question in totality. From the retained stake standpoint, there are two things that are very clear to us today: First, as you know, we're in the process of finalizing the bank line transaction, which is going to reduce our gross debt by $1.45 billion. That will be completed imminently. The second item is, in this quarter, we expect to contribute more than $600 million in equity to our pension plan. That of course is subject to Department of Labor approval. So those things are in my view very definitive.","As we move on to the remaining transactions, our preliminary plan is to pursue two additional transactions. One is an equity for debt exchange, and the second is an equity for equity split-off. We currently expect to pursue the debt exchange early in Q2 and the equity exchange closer to mid-year. There's going to be a number of factors that lead us to finally size these transactions, but you're right: from a placeholder standpoint, our current view is that we'll use at Baxalta's current price a little more than $2 billion to retire debt and a little less than $1 billion to retire equity. But as I said before, these transactions are subject to market conditions, optimal pricing, and our objective is to maximize long-term value and optimize economics with respect to these transactions.","So as far as definitive plans, I can tell you these are our very preliminary plans, but by no means definitive. We're evaluating what the optimal mix is, so there may be changes to these transactions as we move forward based on the receptivity of the market and a number of other factors. As we finalize plans and execute transactions, clearly we'll update guidance. But, you know, we have enough information today to share with you these preliminary estimates which provide sort of some balance around the guidance range that were given.","In combination, we expect about a $0.15 benefit this year. There would be some increase to next year in part because the equity for equities transaction would occur very close to mid-year in this plan assumption and also the equity for debt exchange we'd have at least a quarter more of benefit rolling into 2017.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's a great overview, Jay. Thanks very much. And, Joe, let's just talk strategy for a minute. So you touched on a number of the themes that you talked about in San Francisco including portfolio optimization and, improving R&D productivity, improving the overall growth mix of the business, and being in the top quartile of shareholder returns. The big part of that is putting this Baxalta stake in ultimately your balance sheet to work to create value. You talked about doing more likely a series of smaller deals to achieve those objectives. As you think about that, is the number one priority to accelerate the overall mix of growth in the company's end markets, or should we look at it as more ROIC driven, more margin driven? Maybe just help us think about if you're looking \u2013 if you have targets and if you're looking to do something in particular for the company, is it accelerating the top line? Or how do we think about that mix?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're going to, Mike, take a look at, we have three to five years horizons. Right? So what can we do to change the trajectory of the company's top line growth and bottom line? What comes first? So we need to \u2013 we already have embarked on this extensive operational excellence program to cut cost. We're going to double down on that and become a little bit more aggressive. That will create some momentum as we continue to look for the opportunities at the top line. When you talk about the capital allocation at top line, we have about four, five businesses that we probably get a significant amount of investment from the company on the organic arena. I'm going to talk more about that in May. I don't want to pre-empt that now.","But also we're going to invest inorganically in opportunities for those businesses. When we talk about how to hit it well, we want to change \u2013 we want to buy business that they're growing faster than our current based business. That is a pretty obvious thing. The second thing is if we can combine that with good synergistic deal, we'll do it as well. And why do I put a bracket around very large deals? Because very large deals are very difficult to find. We can keep looking for a deal like that. It will take a couple of years versus just creating a really good strategy by looking at adjacencies and pairing (38:20) good businesses with acquisitions that makes sense.","I don't discard size being large, but I'd just say, it's much more difficult to encounter that than something else that will create value almost instantly and you can execute a little faster. So I'm looking at this whole thing as a journey where we make sure that our cost is in place while we augment our internal innovation and supplement internal innovation with some really well thought out acquisitions.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. That's helpful, Joe. Thanks. I'll let someone else jump in.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thank you, and good morning.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, Joe. Great to hear your voice. A couple of quick questions. First of all, to start out with, with Jay on the operating margin guidance for 2016, you're exiting the year at just below 11% and you're guiding for 2016 at 11%. And it sounds like cyclo pension FX are kind of a wash. So can you give us a sense as to what kind of underlying operating margin improvement you're assuming for 2016 relative to where you're exiting the year?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, there is an important point to make which is \u2013 and you know this about our business, Bob. We have seasonality, which typically the second half of the year is stronger than the first half. And the fourth quarter is typically one of the strongest margin quarters that we have, in large part because of incremental sales performance that naturally occurs. And so as we think about margin performance next year versus this year, I do think it's important to look at the entire year holistically. And if you think about the full year for 2015, we're at about approximately 9% margin going to the 11% that we've guided to. So it is a fairly substantial step change improvement in margin.","The other point I will make is our Q1 guidance does have the lowest margin of the year. Again, in part driven by the fact that Q1 sales are typically the lightest because of all of the fixed costs we have in place, there is some absorption that does not occur due to the lower level of sales. So I think those are a couple of important points. By and large we're very pleased with the margin improvement that this plan indicates. The second half of the year was very important for us, in large part because it gave us confidence that we could give solid guidance for 2016 and that we could operate effectively on a standalone basis. But I do think it's important to consider the seasonality and the trending in margin when we think about 2016.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. So maybe just year-over-year then, ex the things that are affecting margins like cyclo pension and FX, what kind of year-over-year underlying margin improvement are you assuming with the 11%?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. So essentially we're talking about, as I said, 200 basis points from 2015 to 2016. And let me highlight a few items for you that impact that. Cyclo is about 80 basis point or 90 basis point drag relative to 2015. PROTOPAM is another item that we've discussed previously, which is approximately a 30 basis point item. Foreign exchange is about a 1.6 point on a year-over-year basis margin drag. So it's a very substantial \u2013 relative to May, it's less. On a year-over-year basis, it's even more than that. The pension, again, is about a point of improvement year-over-year. But then there are a number of other critical items, and again, these are the ones that I'm happiest to point out.","SG&A savings, we're talking about a two percentage point improvement in SG&A. R&D savings, we're talking about a 60 basis point improvement. And then operationally, because many of the initiatives that we're putting in place from a mix volume standpoint along with some of our pricing and economic value capture initiatives along with general business growth yields approximately a little more than one percentage point of margin improvement. So I walked you through a number of items there, and there's a lot of moving pieces that take us from the 9% to 11%.","But as I say, there are a number of important ones that we can point to operationally that are really driving this improvement that I think, based on the second half of this year, we have confidence in as we move forward.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And thank you for that. And then, Joe, just real quickly, one of the questions that we're getting a lot from investors is, you're articulating a plan to drive faster growth for the company on the top line basis. And people are I think very curious as to how the balance will look, what the balance will look like in terms of the need to invest in the business incrementally to drive that top line growth versus what investors are looking for in terms of operating leverage in the business as you look forward over the next couple years. So how do you respond to that kind of question about the need to invest to get top line growth, but the desire for people to see real operating leverage progress here?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, we need to look this in phases. We need to bring the leverage at the same time that we invest, meaning we need to accelerate some of our cost reductions. Secondly, our spending in R&D today is adequate for the portfolio as we see in the near and midterm. Meaning we don't need to spend more money than we're spending today as a matter of mix. And if we need to spend more money, we need to self-fund that and make sure that does not impact our earnings. So this is not an investment story where we have an R&D budget that is completely underfunded to deliver an innovation. We just need to do a better job in allocating capital to the right franchise that have the chance to grow faster. So I had mentioned for instance IPS. We'll double down in IPS to be able to get more molecules to the marketplace, so we're working on plans like this very rapidly. But that is a reallocation of resources.","I want to make sure our investors are clear that as we work to accelerate our cost reductions to provide for improved bottom line, we will create a mix change in how we spend money to be able to invest in the right things and concurrently look at some good acquisitions that will come in and create a momentum and change in our weighted average market growth rate.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. So wanted to just one clarifying question, Jay, on Q1 guidance. You mentioned the sort of puts and takes and I think some seasonal effects that maybe show for a little \u2013 the weakest quarter of the year in terms of margins and a touch below where we were expecting. Was there anything else other than just absorption, or was there any FX impact there that you can quantify?","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, sure. Just a couple of comments in terms of Q1. Historically for Baxter, Q1 has been the weakest quarter of the year with approximately 23% to 24% of full-year sales occurring in the quarter and 2016 is no different for us. The result of that of course is you have a lower drop through both in terms of margin and then ultimately in terms of EPS. And then there is another factor which is, we do have a slightly larger FX impact in the first quarter than we do in later quarters in the year. So roughly 40% of the FX impact on a full-year basis occurs in the first quarter of the year. So really those would be the two items that I would point to. There's nothing specific beyond that as we look at sales and performance in 2016.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you. And then one follow up on one of the things that's driving much of your growth in the current portfolio of businesses is around pumps. And really impressive number in Q4. Stepping back and thinking about that business, as we all know, it has had its challenges in the past as a category. And I just look to get an update on how you feel you're positioned with the new business coming in from SIGMA with some of the new FDA actions and guidelines on cybersecurity and some of the competitor that have had problems with that sort of new category requirement. How you're positioned going forward to help sort of mitigate the risks of other kinds of problems that you've had in the past as a group in pumps, not just Baxter, obviously.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Matt, this is Joe. I can only speak about the Baxter product. In terms of the industry, you outlined well. There's always a concern. But this is not only \u2013 the only programmable pump that you have in that category. You have (48:28) pumps, you have all kinds of different things that fall into that category. But speaking specifically about our business, we have launched a really good product. And you can attest to \u2013 the testament to it is the sales growth and how we are gaining back market share and how that business is doing well. The team is executing very, very well.","Our objective is to continue to improve the operation ability of the pump. We have new versions coming up in a couple more years. We have two more versions of the same platform. We are very excited about the prospect to create some new features within this pump, and we think in terms of cybersecurity, our pump has performed well. You can't in this area always guarantee 100%. We're doing the best we can to make sure that the platform we have is safe and secure for the clinicians who are programming it for the patients who are receiving the fluid.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Oh, hi. Good morning, everyone.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Larry.","Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Joe, I'm wondering if we could start out perhaps just talking a little bit about how you see the health of the emerging markets as you look into 2016. And I'm not so much talking about FX rates, but just more about just the baseline fundamentals within the various regions.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you read the same headlines I do read, there is a contraction in some of the major \u2013 the larger emerging market economies. Very different in nature between China and Brazil and Russia, but nonetheless, we do 25% of our business in those regions. I think one particular thing about our business is that we are not a physician preferred product in those regions, and we are a hospital necessity. So we're talking about infusion, we're talking about dialysis, and those products are needed. So we have seen price pressure in those markets, but we probably saw that ahead of many people because of the nature of the products. So we feel that the risk of those markets for Baxter deteriorating further is pretty low.","With all that said, is our responsibility to look at our portfolio in those countries and make sure that we're selling the right products to the right markets. And we're going through that process as we speak. But in terms of the headlines for Baxter is those are necessity products in hospital settings, and we've seen most of the contraction already. I'm not saying that we're not going to have them in the future, but we are not a physician preferred product company in those markets. So I feel very comfortable that our strategy at the moment is solid. But going forward, rest assured we're going to look at every region and every country to make sure that the business we have are profitable and have good prospects going forward.","Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. And then I wanted to, Joe, perhaps get at again the growth question a little bit differently. And I think in your prepared comments you talked about reigniting the innovation engine at Baxter, and so you talked about sort of reallocating resources to drive inorganic and you talked about potential \u2013 excuse me, organic means, and then potential organic opportunities. But I guess as you've been there, and I know it's a short time, what do you really need to do to change, again, the ability of Baxter to innovate? Do you need to change the culture? Do you need to hire folks into these various categories to really drive the innovation? What needs to happen to get that engine ignited?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So just a comment on how new I am. I can tell you I know where the cafeteria is because I eat there almost every day. So the culture of the company is one of innovation for many years. I think by not having Baxalta as part of Baxter today really puts the spotlight how we take those franchise that have been trusted in a long-term franchises around the globe and make them more innovative, create adjacencies within our own capabilities, our four walls here for organic growth. And the culture that I'm passing on to our employees is very clearly is about having a strategic direction, and that's about 10% of the conversation. 90% of the conversation is execution.","So it's making sure that once we make the allocation of capital to the right programs, that our people deliver on time or better than that. And that's all about execution. So that's what I'm watching very closely, because I think we have very, very smart people at Baxter. I'm not surprised, but I'm very pleased with what I found here, and I want the folks of Baxter to understand that from this point when we get this strategy going, it's all about execution. And I think I have everybody behind me when it comes to that.","Larry S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much for the comments.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, and nice quarter. And it's good to hear your voice on a conference call again, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Couple of things. First of all, we haven't heard in a while where you are on home hemodialysis and if you can give us an update on that, that would be great. And then in no particular order, second question, is there a way to quantify the $600 million in FX \u2013 not FX, pension impact on gross margins? And last but not least, M&A clearly is going to be a theme here. Big picture thoughts on adding additional legs to the stool and how you think about that. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Joanne. How are you? Listen, I'm very, very excited about home hemodialysis, first of all. It is what I call blue ocean for the company. It is a great clinically needed innovation. It is not a easy market to get in because the technology has to be absolutely perfect for bringing this therapy to the home. But we think we have the right technology and working very hard to refine technology. Right now we already have kicked off our U.S. clinical trial for VIVIA, and we're excited about that. In Europe, we have early patients and we're learning very quickly about our VIVIA platform, and the use of this device is proving to be well received in Europe.","So we like our technology. It is an area that I will call is a strategic bet and why is it strategic? Because it's high end market growth, potential for good revenue per patient, but more so the therapy itself is absolutely fantastic for the hemodialysis patient to be able to do this at home. So we're going to continue to improve our technology, and we will try to put some momentum behind accelerating the U.S. trial as much as we can and work with the agencies and CMS and see if we can get this technology at a different level.","James K. Saccaro - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Joanne, you asked a question about pension and quantifying, and you commented on $600 million. I think \u2013 I hope I didn't say that. That's an overstatement in terms of the impact on operating margin. On plan, it's about 60 basis points, which is closer to $60 million of unplanned benefit. But maybe taking a step back to talk about the overall impact of pension, overall we expect approximately a $0.14 benefit year-over-year from pension. $0.07 roughly of that relates to the retained stake contribution that we plan to make in the coming month or so. And then the remaining portion, there's a few different pieces.","First, the actual discount rate used to measure the liability has increased, and the result of that is approximately a $0.035 benefit. Second, as we've evaluated our accounting for our pension plan, we made three adjustments. One is we updated the mortality table that we're using. The second is we are now employing the recently approved methodology for accounting for discount rate and that's a benefit. And then the return on asset assumption is an item that we've lowered. So those three accounting changes that we've made impact us positively by about $0.02. And then we have some amortized losses that are rolling off. So that's about $0.01.","So in combination, we're talking about a $0.14 year-over-year impact, and importantly this counteracts some of the negatives like the lack of sundry income that we experienced in 2016 along with the significant headwind on foreign exchange. But overall, the pension impact is in that order of magnitude.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. And the last question, add a leg of the stool.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We will continue to work on inorganic and organic areas. I would say to you that a leg of the stool may be just enhancing a franchise that we have. We spoke about IPS and very, very excited about that. I like our specialty injectable business today, and I think augmenting that can become a real good business. And in terms of white space is a little early. We need to kind of get our capital allocation going well, and once we have that well segmented within our population and our management objectives then we can do a white space analysis, and we will proceed on going down that path. But we really have enough opportunities right now to augment the current businesses. And their adjacencies as well. Thank you.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions: One, in the fourth quarter, your surgical business grew low single digits and you said it grew in line with the market. And then for 2016, you're talking about the surgical business growing 3% to 4%. So are you saying that you expect surgical volumes and utilization to pick up in 2016? Or are you just saying the better rates are more specific to Baxter? So any thoughts on utilization rates, especially the U.S. And then my second question has to do with the U.S. renal business specifically with PD. I know PD did better in the fourth quarter that was some of your new products. But are you also seeing an increase in penetration in the U.S. with PD? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Glenn, how are you?","Unknown Speaker","Good.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, listen, the utilization that we see, I just want to clarify, the next year's growth is 2% to 3%, Right?","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","For surgical care.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For surgical care. So the utilization remains at a good point in U.S. I would say the U.S. has shown really good resilience, and we're happy about that. There's a couple things about the surgical business, one that our anesthesia gases are performing very well, and we need to do a better job in our biosurgery business. We're going to be coming up with some specific actions in terms of execution, but also how we're going to manage that business on a global basis, as well as that is an area that we probably should be looking to augment our portfolio. It's a great area of opportunity. Baxter has fantastic franchises within that category, and we want to make sure we don't miss the opportunity to take advantage of the market growth.","So speaking about the PD business, we are growing our patient basis. So that is market share growth. And I'm going to tell you our new technology, new platform AMIA is fantastic, and we're having some really early successes and we're looking for a very good 2016 in that arena.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter\u2019s permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Ludwig Hantson, President of BioScience; and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today\u2019s call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter\u2019s ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Bob Parkinson","Thanks Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you all for calling in. As you read in the press release issued earlier this morning Baxter reported strong financial results for the first quarter which exceeded expectations and we\u2019ve also confirmed our full year 2014 guidance. Adjusted earnings increased 9% to $1.19 per diluted share and worldwide sales excluding currency increased 16%. Excluding Gambro and foreign currency, Baxter\u2019s sales advanced 5%. Positive momentum is building and Baxter is off to a strong start in 2014. I\u2019m pleased that we delivered strong financial results continued to enhance our flexibility to invest for future growth and position the company for sustained performance and success.","Our new product pipeline is focused on a number of programs that improve the quality of care and address key high potential areas of unmet medical needs. Some recent highlights in the quarter include FDA approval of a label change allowing for a shorter total infusion time for GLASSIA, a chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy for hereditary emphysema and under diagnosed condition characterized by a low level of alpha-1 protein in the blood.","This change enhances convenience and allows for less overall time for the entire infusion process from preparation to administration. Also success in meeting the primary efficacy endpoint in the phase III study of BAX 111. The first stand-alone recombinant treatment in clinical development for von Willebrand Disease for a on-demand bleeding events.","We expect to file for regulatory approval in the United States before the end of 2014. We also intend to pursue a study for a prophylaxis indication. Baxter also presented interim data that the European association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders from our first year observation from the ADVATE HaEmophilia A Database study, a four year outcomes registry of Hemophilia A patients. A total of 562 patients have been enrolled to-date. And the data supports the clinical experience of prophylaxis treatment with ADVATE, showing 51% experienced no bleeds during the one year of treatment.","Also in the quarter, we executed a new exclusive agreement with Xenetic Biosciences for the development of BAX 826, a recombinant Factor VIII therapy for hemophilia A utilizing Xenetic\u2019s proprietary polysialic acid technology. BAX 826 is currently in preclinical development as a treatment that maybe administered less frequently potentially at once weekly intervals without compromising efficacy.","At lastly during the quarter, the company acquired Chatham Therapeutics including their developmental Gene Therapy preclinical hemophilia A and ongoing hemophilia B programs and the potential application for additional hemophilia treatments. As you may recall Baxter and Chatham are currently in a phase I, II trial evaluating Chatham\u2019s Biological Nano Particle platform as the potential treatment for hemophilia B. The vector-based technology which provides a mechanism for the patients on liver to begin producing Factor IX following a single dose of the genetically engineered treatment as the potential to redefine the concept of longer acting therapy.","And finally in the first quarter as you all know we reached a significant milestone in our company\u2019s history with the announcement of our plans to create two separate independent global healthcare companies, one focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life saving medical products. This decision supports Baxter\u2019s evolution and underscores our commitment to ensuring our long-term strategic priorities remain lined with shareholders best interest, while creating value for patients, healthcare providers and other key stakeholders.","The two businesses operate in distinct markets with the corresponding underlying fundamentals and each possess unique and compelling growth prospects, investment requirements and risk profiles. The spin-off will create two well capitalized independent companies with strong balance sheets, investment grade profiles and disciplined approaches to capital allocation. And other benefits of this include one greater management focus on the distinct businesses of biopharmaceuticals and medical products, the ability to more effectively commercialize new and existing product offerings.","The ability to drive innovation across the franchises and allocate necessary resources to the areas presenting the highest growth potential and the flexibility to pursue respective growth and investment strategies resulting in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns. We look forward to closing this transaction by mid-2015 and preparations are already been made to affect in efficient and orderly transition to position both companies to capitalize on the exciting opportunities that the future holds.","So with that, I would like to ask Bob at this point review financial results for the first quarter and also discuss our guidance for the remainder of 2014. Bob?","Bob Hombach","Thanks Bob and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned adjusted earnings per diluted per share in the first quarter advanced 9% to $1.19, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.06 to $1.09 per share. These financial results include an after tax gain of $35 million or $0.06 per share associated with the sale of certain equity investments, which will largely be reinvested in the business over the balance of the year.","As we mentioned in the press release GAAP earnings of $1.01 per diluted share included after tax special items totaling $96 million or $0.18 per share for intangible asset amortization and cost associated with the integration of Gambro business development and business optimization initiatives. The business optimization initiatives include additional cost related to the decision to explore strategic options for the vaccines and cell therapies R&D programs.","Now, let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2014. Starting with sales, worldwide sales were approximately $4 billion advanced 15%. On a constant currency basis sales rose 16% and exceeded our guidance range primarily due to strong demand for hemophilia products as well as the accelerated timing of vaccine milestone payments and a renal PD tender. Excluding Gambro revenues of $400 million which were in line with expectations Baxter sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis.","In terms of individual business performance, Global BioScience sales of more than $1.6 billion advanced 5% in the first quarter. On the constant currency basis sales increased 6%. Within the product categories, hemophilia sales of $827 million increased 8% or 9% on a constant currency basis. This is the result of capitalizing on our global leadership position and brand differentiation broadening our portfolio with new product launches like RIXUBIS for the treatment of Hemophilia B and expanding access to care particularly in emerging markets.","Specifically global demand for ADVATE remain strong as we continue to benefit from our label expansion improved prophylaxis penetration and shipments to Brazil as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobr\u00e1s to enhance access to Recombinant factor A therapy.","We have now converted more than 30% of the total patients in Brazil and we expect to generate sales of more than $100 million in 2014. In addition, global demand for FEIBA also remained robust resulting in double digit sales growth in the quarter.","In BioTherapeutics sales of $502 million declined 1% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Growth in the U.S. of 7% was a result of improved cost availability and growth of the Immune Globulin therapies albumin and alpha-1 treatments. This strength was more than offset by lower sales in international markets as a result of lower albumin sales in China and decisions to exit certain markets due to previous supply constraints.","Sales in BioSurgery of $176 million increased 2%, on a constant currency basis sales rose 3% driven by demand for surgical sealants like TISSEL and COSEAL. As you know both of these products is tied directly to growth in surgical procedures.","Finally, vaccines revenue totaled $103 million and increased 23%. Sales advanced 25% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by accelerated milestone payments of approximately $40 million related to ongoing government collaborations for the development of influenza vaccines.","In medical products global sales exceeded $2.3 billion and increased 22%. On a constant currency basis sales advanced 24%. Excluding Gambro and foreign currencies medical product sales grew 4%. Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $991 million including Gambro sales of $400 million. Excluding Gambro and foreign currency renal sales increased 4%. This was a result of strong PD growth of 9% supported by strong patient gain in the U.S. and emerging markets that also benefit from the timing of certain tender sales of more than $15 million. This momentum was partially offset by the divestiture of the CRRT business.","Sales in the fluid system category of $757 million increased 2% or 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance continued to be driven by price improvements for the injectable oncology drug cyclophosphamide which more than offset lower sales of drug delivery systems.","Especially pharmaceuticals which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies posted sales of $367 million reflecting an increase of 1%. Sales rose 2% on the constant currency basis as strong global anesthesia growth offset lower sales of certain nutritional therapies resulting from ongoing supplier shortages.","Finally sales in BioPharma solutions which is our pharma partner business totaled $228 million with close to 1% on a reported basis or 4% on a constant basis. This performance attributed primarily to the easing of supply constraints which impacted orders and shipments in the first quarter of last year.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 51.0% compared to 51.7% last year. Margin expansion in the base Baxter business was more than offset by the impact of lower margin Gambro business and in foreign currency.","SG&A totaled $903 million and increased 16% with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the growth. Excluding Gambro SG&A increased 2% as leverage close to arise and benefits associated with our business optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by select investments and promotional and marketing initiatives for new product launches and with the international market to enhance our global presence.","R&D spending in the quarter of $282 million increased 15% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro R&D rose 2% and continuous to be driven by investments we are making to advance a number of programs in our pipeline, including those in our leading hemophilia franchise, programs to leverage our expertise in the therapeutic areas of hematology, oncology and immunology and investments in renal therapies aimed and improving patient outcomes across the continuum of care.","The operating margin in the quarter of 21% is lower than last year\u2019s operating margin of 22%. However, excluding Gambro, leverage in the base Baxter business was also been an operating margin improvement of 80 basis points to 22.8% versus the prior year. Interest expense was $43 million which reflects recent debt issuances to fund both the Covington plasma manufacturing site and the Gambro acquisition.","Other income totaled $41 million compared to income of $30 million last year. This includes $44 million of pre-tax gains associated with the sale of certain equity investments. As referenced earlier on an after tax basis, this equates to benefit of $35 million or $0.06 per share with largely reinvested in the business over the balance of the year. The tax rate was 21.4% for the quarter in line with our expectations and as previously mentioned adjusted earnings per diluted share advanced 9% to $1.19.","For the first quarter, cash flow from operations was very strong and totaled $559 million. This reflects an improvement versus last year of approximately $175 million. DSO ended the quarter at 53.6 days and excluding Gambro, Baxter\u2019s DSO was 49.9 days lower than the prior year by 3.7 days.","Inventory turns of 2.0 or lower than 2.2 turns in the prior year period due to increased plasma inventories to support strong demand and future growth. Lastly, in the first three months of this year, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares for $250 million or on a net basis 1.2 million shares for $123 million in line with our full year objective.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2014. For the full year, we continued to expect adjusted earnings of $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share. As we know that last quarter, we are providing a lighter range, it\u2019s been our historical practice as a number of factors and assumptions impact the outlook particularly headwinds created by cyclophosphamide competition in emerging market FX volatility.","Specifically by line item of the P&L and starting with sales, we continue to expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 9% to 10%, which includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 8% to 9%. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales to grow approximately 2% on a constant currency basis.","For the full year, we continued to expect gross margin for the company to decline by approximately 150 basis points in the 2013 margin of 52%. Given the strong first quarter, we expect the first half margin to be approximately 40 to 50 basis points higher than the gross margin in the second half which includes the impact of new competitive entrants.","In terms of expenses, as mentioned earlier our first quarter performance enhances our flexibility to invest in the business to drive future growth. Therefore, we now expect R&D to grow in mid-single digits and SG&A to grow in mid-to-high single digits.","We expect interest expense to total approximately $160 million and we now expect other income of approximately $40 million for the year. We expect the tax rate of approximately 21.5% and we expect a full year average share count of approximately 547 million shares, which assumes approximately 300 million in net share repurchases.","From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5 billion. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.","Let me move to sales and expand our assumptions for the two businesses and the major product categories which are very consistent with our original guidance.","Beginning with medical products on a constant currency basis including the contribution of Gambro, we expect sales growth of approximately 13% to 14%. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales from medical products to grow 0% to 1%. Specifically, we expect renal sales to grow approximately 40% including the benefit of continued PD penetration, the incremental revenue contribution from Gambro as well as commercial synergies.","We expect fluid system sales to decline 3% to 5% reflecting the impact of lower cyclophosphamide sales. As we mentioned, if we have two competitors by mid-year, the sales and pre-tax impact would equate to $150 million to $200 million. We expect specialty pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in the 3% to 5% range. And we now expect our BioPharma Solutions sales to be flat for the full year.","For BioScience, we project sales growth excluding foreign currency at 3% to 4%. Our outlook includes growth of 4% to 5% in our hemophilia franchise. Well we continue to expect to increase competition for recombinant factor VIII therapies in the second half of this year, performance will be fueled by underlying global demand for ADVATE, convergent to recombinant therapy in Brazil, new tender awards, as well as the benefit from new product launches, including RIXUBIS, OBI-1 and FEIBA prophylaxis.","For the BioTherapeutics franchise, we continue to expect growth of approximately 4% with sales of albumin in China and immunoglobulin therapies ramping up particularly in the second half of the year. In BioSurgery, we expect growth in the 5% to 7% range. And finally, given the first quarter performance, we now expect our vaccine sales to decline in low single-digits.","As mentioned in our press release, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share excluding special items of $1.18 to $1.22, which reflects the timing benefits that were accelerated and recorded in the first quarter. We expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 12% to 13%. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales at constant currency rates to grow approximately 2%.","Thanks. I\u2019ll now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International\u2019s website for 30 days at www.baxter.com.","Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Bob Parkinson","Good morning.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Bob, simply start off on the financial guidance for the second quarter, obviously a very nice start to the first quarter year on earnings, some of that was the gain but just the underlying business was stronger and margins are good. Can you talk us about what factors change here in the second quarter, because that earnings number is little lower and you would have expect to get assuming the strength in the first quarter?","Bob Parkinson","Certainly, David. Yes, there are definitely an unusual number of timing impacts here that have benefited the first quarter to the determent of the second quarter. And I would gage that in a $0.05 to $0.06 range. And, so let me walk you through those, it\u2019s really two main things. We have a collaboration on the vaccine side to do a tech transfer related to our Vero cell technology, we expected milestones to occur later in the year and including in the second quarter. The good news is, those were completed a bit early and fully recognized in the first quarter, but that does create about $0.03 of upside in the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter.","And then secondly, again along the lines of revenue recognition in terms of timing of when tender sales occur, we have a large tender in the PD franchise that we expected in the second that occurred in the first. The combination of those two and a couple other things really is what drove the strong performance in the first quarter. I would also mention that as you know the gains in the first quarter that we highlighted there of $0.06 related to the two minority investments that were sold. We also incurred incremental FX in the first quarter that dampened the impact of some of these timing benefits primarily related to Argentina, and other emerging market impacts including related to the Gambro business.","So, a lot going on between the first and second quarter, I think if you look at the two of them combined it will give you a better sense of where we\u2019re at and that\u2019s largely why if we looked at the full year, we\u2019d maintain our full year guidance, again a lot of volatility potentially we have ahead of us with cyclo and FX but operationally a very, very solid start.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Mary Kay Ladone","And David, I would also add that in plasma, we have some plasma tender timing as well that impacts the second quarter versus the prior year. Those tenders are going to occur more in the third and fourth quarter this year versus some of the major tenders that occurred in the second quarter last year.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, Mary Kay. Very helpful. And then, maybe just a follow-up. The key strength where we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters has been but still and I imagine that\u2019s a surprise for certain investors. So, if we think about that strength, in the last two quarters, obviously it\u2019s coming out of the U.S. markets. And there is really two factors going on this quarter, it feels like one is Brazil and there maybe some of the early product launches like RIXUBIS, but you talked about Brazil being about $100 million in 2014. Frankly, based on the trend-line out of 2013 in the first quarter result, $100 million just seems low. So, is there anything going on in terms of the timing of Brazil or maybe you can give us the mix of the factors contributing to U.S. in the affiliate strength during the first quarter. Just seems that, that $100 million number could go a lot higher in 2014?","Bob Parkinson","Yes, it could go somewhat higher David. I would tell you in the first quarter, though the contribution from Brazil was not outside in the sense of what the trend would need to be in order for us to deliver something just north of $100 million. So, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. And so, that certainly is a contributor, but frankly ADVATE continues to do well in many other international markets including markets like Japan where we\u2019ve had very strong growth over the last couple of years.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with the questions. Please state your questions.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Question on clarifications on the guidance. So, the \u2013 it looks like you took another price increase about 30% on cyclophosphamide in January. Can you just maybe clarify what you\u2019re assuming in the second quarter relative to competition, I haven\u2019t seen anybody announcing it then. Just want to clarify what you\u2019re assuming? And then second, look at guidance for the year, I assume you weren\u2019t assuming the $0.06 gain in the original guidance. So, why should we move up number by $0.06 given the gain here this quarter? Thanks.","Bob Parkinson","Okay. Couple of things, so on cyclo, I\u2019d like to first point out, we in our Q1 guidance did not assume any competition nor do we see any competition and results in the first quarter were basically as expected. So, cyclo was not a contributor to our performance in the first quarter relative to our guidance. At this point, we\u2019re not expecting competitive entrants though very late in the second quarter, so not much impact in the second quarter either but certainly in the back-half then depending on when the second and or third enters in, that will determine how that plays out for the remainder of the year, but for the second quarter again not expecting significant competitive impact on cyclo.","As to the price increase, we did take a price increase, obviously there are different channels and different customer relationships, I wouldn\u2019t say with across the board at the same level, but we did take a price increase in the first quarter.","Mary Kay Ladone","And then the gain Bob.","Bob Parkinson","As it relates to the gain, yes. And so, as I mentioned there are some aspects here as well in the first quarter FX being 1. But, as we look at the balance of the year in some of the areas that we want to ensure reposition ourselves to generate the best success. We are looking at R&D and SG&A reinvestment here that over the balance of the year, we\u2019re not going to be taking that gain to the bottom-line.","Mary Kay Ladone","And we did change our guidance...","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan","I have a question for Bob Parkinson. And I really want to focus on strategy for the medical product side of the business close within. Can you just talk little bit about what drives that business and I\u2019m really thinking not only about the top-line but about margins obviously it\u2019s going to be a big regions that the next pertaining two months with Cyclophosphamide going away. But once that\u2019s done, what drives there when your top-line, but what drives margins there and what periods kind of the story beyond this be currently underlying growth we\u2019re seeing right now? Thanks.","Bob Parkinson","Yes. Okay, Mike. So, let me not be too lengthy in my response because there is not a simple response. So let me start with the Gambro acquisition. Which as we discussed before, it allows us to participate in a leadership role in a large global markets that we believe will grow in the 5% to 6% range long-term. And so, the acquisition of Gambro, the expansion of our presence augmenting our PD business to address treatment of end-stage renal disease a significant long-term growth platform for the newly defined medical products business, but I think you all understand that.","Within the traditional medication delivery business if you will, again our plans are to intensify focus in those product categories that are higher growth than higher margins. So, anesthesia would be one parenteral nutrition would be another. Also, there continue to be opportunities to improve margins in our core global IV business in terms of manufacturing efficiencies, productivity, supply chain productivity in the like. So, again there is not a simple answer to that. I think there is a lot of levers might that can be pulled to enhance margin over the long-term in the newly defined Baxter if you will going forward.","And I would also say that as we\u2019ve accelerated business development activity over the last couple of years, certainly it is our plan to continue that as we go forward with the new company. So, I think the \u2013 I think the \u2013 with increased focus which is one of the primary rationales behind the decision to spin-off the Biopharmaceuticals business with an increased focus globally frankly I think will allow us to address a number of margin improvement opportunities over time.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan","Great. Thank you, Bob.","Bob Parkinson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Bob Parkinson","Bruce, are you there?","Operator","Please check your mute button sir. And we\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Larry Keusch \u2013 Raymond James","Hi, good morning. Just to perhaps for Bob Hombach. Bob you obviously mentioned in your prepared comments that the underlying Baxter gross margin has been improving, I believe you said up 80 basis points year-over-year. So, I just want to dig into that and fully understand what is driving those improvements there because that\u2019s pretty impressive? And then, secondly if we could just get an update on where you guys stand with the large volume infusion pumps?","Bob Hombach","Sure. So, yeah the comment was around operating margin and there is obviously a number of factors there in the base Baxter business FX, calling FX to the side which has tended to be more of a headwind in the last couple of quarters. Mix, certainly placed in ADVATE strong hemophilia sales here for the quarter. The business optimization efforts that we put into not only this year but last year as well are certainly playing into that. The vaccine milestones come with fairly high margins as well. So, those being recognized here in the first quarter were beneficial as well. And we are starting to see the benefits of the Gambro synergies starting to come into the -I know we\u2019re talking about the base Baxter business but overall that is something that\u2019s going to drive our margins throughout the rest of the year.","Larry Keusch \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great. And then on the pump side, where do we stand there?","Bob Hombach","So, update on the pumps, as we had filed the necessary documents and are waiting for the review to be complete and we expect to hear something about in middle of this year, so I don\u2019t think there is really any other update at this point.","Larry Keusch \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask just Bob if I could, Bob Hombach on the gain and the FX loss you mentioned the FX, the incremental FX kind of offsetting the gain. I guess we were looking for about a dime of FX impact this year. Did this push you closer to $0.15 or can you give us anymore color on to just how that offsets that number? And then I have a couple of quick follow-ups.","Bob Hombach","Yes. So, Matt actually we characterize them more like a $0.15 at the time we gave guidance for the full year, we had FX at about $0.15 headwind. And in fact it\u2019s going to be a little bit higher than that given the Argentina situation as well as how things are playing out. I think I would note about FX is historically a stronger euro would be beneficial to Baxter given the size of our business there and a overall global manufacturing footprint. As we bring Gambro into the fold though, the vast majority of their manufacturing a lot of their cost base is in euro. And so, we\u2019re actually like we benefit less from a stronger euro in the near-term, but it did increase our exposure to all other currencies outside the U.S. given the footprint they have. And so as emerging market currencies have continued to struggle a bit, our current set up here with Gambro given the stronger euro and the weaker emerging market currencies actually creates incremental FX downsides in that original $0.15 assumption.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","That\u2019s helpful. And then the other comment, I think that Bob or one of your mate here in the beginning of the call was around sort of synergies or sort of the broad portfolio of hemophilia products of course FEIBA launching in the quarter, appropriate FEIBA and OUS strength. I guess, can you tell us little bit about anything that any sort of -any sort of synergy effects of launching these multiple therapies into this general category whether it\u2019s for hemophilia B, hemophilia A or the treatment of inhibitors as in FEIBA that you\u2019re seeing develop in the market either in the U.S. or international? And then I have just one last quick one.","Bob Hombach","So a couple of things, I want to come back to the comment that was made on the strong demand x U.S. for the hemophilia. I must add to that that we also continue to see strong demand for ADVATE and FEIBA in the U.S. And although it\u2019s not reflecting the sales numbers still there were some inventory adjustments versus first quarter of last quarter. So, we stick to our full guidance and believe that the U.S. is also showing a very strong demand.","As far as the launches is concerned, the launches are staggered geographically RIXUBIS at this moment a U.S. launch company as you know we still needed the application end of last year both in Europe as well as Japan and so we expect to launch RIXUBIS ex-U.S. by the beginning of 2015. As far as the launch is -are concerned, so as this prophy is on track, we launched this in 2012, we\u2019ve had more than 500 patients on ADVATE, FEIBA prophy is on track. We launched this in the beginning of this year and it is ahead of expectations and it\u2019s also reflected in our numbers, and the RIXUBIS launch as I said in the U.S. is on track. We\u2019ve converted quite some patients, so we really pleased with the launches in our hemophilia franchise.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, and then Ludwig the last one actually is for you. Just if you \u2013 we\u2019re all looking at competition \u2013 to throw the competition in the back-half in hemophilia and of course also to some top-line indication of the 855 data hopefully on mid-year or third quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering, you\u2019ve said us before that if you did receive anti-inhibitor in that data, that you would announce it as you receive data shortly thereafter. If you could help us understand was the trial fully enrolled in say November or wherever it was, is how far along here do we need to be to feel like or can we feel like there is any sort of comfort level that okay, we\u2019ve gotten this far in with anti-inhibitor, inhibitors usually happen in whatever the early part of that therapy. Any color you could provide us is to whether we should be feeling more comfortable as we get to May or June or July or what\u2019s the timing would be very helpful? Thanks.","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah so I\u2019m not going to speculate on the outcome of the study, but as far as timing is concerned yes we did enrolled less patients in this study end of last year, it is a six month study so that will give you some idea of when the last patient, last assessment will be and correct we have not seen anti-inhibitors. We planned to release the data third quarter of this year with a submission before the end of this year.","Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you and good morning everyone. First question was on the Biotherapeutics business just on the ramp in the back-half of the year. Can you maybe just enumerate some of the details that are supporting that I presume on albumin its obtaining the licenses in China, but you maybe update us on the Sanquin as well in that question?","Bob Hombach","With respect BioT if you did see a negative growth for international in the first quarter, we believe that this is going to change moving forward with particular guidance that we give for the full year for BioT which is plus 4%. So you will see an uptake in growth in the next quarters. There is an impact of albumin especially on the China, IG International will pick up also in the next quarters, so that\u2019s what where we are.","Bob Parkinson","Yeah and we do expect to start meaningful shipments to China and albumin in the second quarter David, we already have one of the two licenses renewed and so, at this rate we expect to sell almost as much albumin in China this year as we did last year.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then the ramp in IG is that coming from the contribution from IQ or ramp up in production somewhere else?","Bob Hombach","It will primarily come from the IG business and the substitute business not from IQ, as we said the ramp up for this for IQ, ex-U.S. as well as U.S. will be minimal, but there will be some contribution, with respect to your question on Sanquin \u2013 Sanquin will not have an impact on the 2014 numbers.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay great. And\u2026","Mary Kay Ladone","I would just add David; we didn\u2019t expect Sanquin to impact 2014 as the capacity won\u2019t come on until early next year.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay. And then on the renal business, I think you said 4% organic growth that included the tender win, but I know its early in the Gambro integration process, but can you give us some sense as to what the magnitude of commercial sort of clinical revenue synergies you might be able to realize in that deal going forward and can that business get to sort of a sustainably ex these had a one-time tenders of 4% to 6% growth rate over time?","Bob Parkinson","Yeah David, Bob Parkinson here. First of all yes is the answer to your \u2013 the last part of your question that clearly is our expectation. It\u2019s a little bit early in the game to quantify commercial synergies although I would say, the first quarter for Gambro and revenue came in virtually spot on our model and of course the rest of the renal business, the legacy renal business was even stronger than our forecast. And we\u2019re beginning to see early stages of synergies, one example, would be certain tenders where our ability to bid more broadly with product offerings and all the categories allow us to compete were previously we\u2019ve been able to -unable to do that. So, we anticipate that we\u2019re going to be able to experience more things like that as we go forward. But certainly the long-term projection the growth of Baxter\u2019s renal business broadly defined both the legacy business and Gambro is going to be very much in line with what I said.","David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen and Company.","Josh Jennings \u2013 Cowen and Company","Hi good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on David\u2019s question, is with the Gambro acquisition I think Bob you said $400 million this quarter and PD growth of 9%. Are you seeing some early cannibalization of your historic hemodialysis business and is there any qualification there?","Bob Parkinson","Well our historic hemodialysis business is, very modest, so I don\u2019t think there is any cannibalization that we\u2019re seeing that at all, Bob I don\u2019t know if you have any.","Bob Hombach","Yeah of course, well two things I would say, we did mention that the CRT divestiture that was about a $55 million business that we had to divest as part of the closing the deal. So that will be throughout 2014 from a growth rate perspective. And while there are some modest impacts, because largely our HT business previously was through was self acting as the distributor for other parties and now that we\u2019ve acquired Gambro that will \u2013 that will tail-off overtime, but in 2014 no significant impacts that we\u2019re expecting on those relations.","Bob Parkinson","Josh I think it\u2019s important for you and everyone to understand to that you raised a question of cannibalization, in terms of our legacy home presence with PD and of course our aspirations to launch our new home hemodialysis systems. We really believe that our broader position resulting from the Gambro acquisition will actually enhance our ability to penetrate the market on both our traditional PD business as well as support the home HT launches as those cascade out overtime. So, we see that as a positive synergistic effect.","Josh Jennings \u2013 Cowen and Company","All right, great thanks for that. And then just one for Ludwig, just on the BAX 111 approval, can you just help us frame the global von Willebrand factor market and I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks a lot.","Ludwig Hantson","Thanks Josh and maybe I should correct you, we didn\u2019t get approval. Your question is 111?","Josh Jennings \u2013 Cowen and Company","Yes.","Ludwig Hantson","So, we got the phase III results and we released those early this week, so we\u2019re really pleased with the results, the products a couple of things on the product it could be the first recombinant von Willebrand and we received orphan status in U.S. and Europe. It\u2019s a pure von Willebrand molecule with a ratio of 100:1. The phase III study was very positive since the 100% of the patients had positive response on the efficacy rating scale, which we read on with the FDA. As far as the market is concerned currently it says $300 million to $400 million, it\u2019s a 100% plasma. But I do see, taking this opportunity to grow this market to increase diagnosis \u2013 diagnosis rates are really low as well as prophy used, since the prophy used is really is about 5% in total and when you look at the type III severe patients it\u2019s only a 20%.","So, we look at this market as a potential market where we continue to make difference in those patients life and increase the value.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify back on Mike\u2019s original question. Was the gain on the sale of the investment contemplated in your guidance that you issued back in January?","Bob Hombach","No, not.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just on\u2026","Mary Kay Ladone","Kristen, can I just add to that as well because, I think Mike\u2019s question, I try to jump in but we did increase the guidance in terms of our R&D spend. We did have an acquisition in the quarter Chatham which is going to increase some R&D on this as well as some other things that are planned as we accelerate some program. So, guidance there went up as well as guidance in SG&A.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And these investments, have you disclosed or is there any filing to share which what exactly you sold and why sold them. I know you guys have had a portfolio of investments.","Bob Parkinson","Well, actually these were much more -much older investments going back 12 to 15 years, there were minority positions we had the underlying companies made an independent decision to sell. And so, we really had no impact on the timing and they both happen to happen in the first quarter and they were sold to private firms. One of them was GHX which is an EDI platform that a number of large healthcare companies got together to form a contortion again 10, 15 years ago and so that was recently sold to again to a private firm. So, that\u2019s really the extend of it.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right, the gain was nothing in your control in terms of the timing, it was just simply these underlying companies were sold to you?","Bob Hombach","Yes, they own less than 10%, I think both, we had a very little say on timing.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then you\u2019d also mentioned, I guess Bob you had mentioned kind of the parenteral nutrition business and your interest there. How do you just think about, I guess expanding that business, would you consider to run acquisitions kind bolster up your nutritional franchise. And does I guess the split off I guess in general just make it a little bit more challenging to do M&A over the next year or so?","Bob Parkinson","I mean this certainly in terms of -in terms of the financial strength, clearly we have the ability to continue the kinds of acquisitions that we\u2019ve done in the recent past. I actually think in some ways Kristen after the split, we might have been have more latitude and flexibility to pursue some things given the nature of the new Baxter without the biopharmaceutical business that would be more aligned with expectations of shareholders. So, clearly business development acquisitions are very much part of our strategy at the new Baxter going forward.","And the area parenteral nutrition, specifically I think is a significantly under penetrated market globally. And I think the opportunity there is really more internal investment to cultivate the growth of that market whereas you know we\u2019re a leader in that market today. Whether specifically there are acquisition candidates within parenteral nutrition not really going to comment it is an evident to me that there are, but the key thing is the underdeveloped nature of that market, I think with the increased focus and associated investment and opportunity to accelerate the growth of that product category.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for bearing with me, phone problems here. Ludwig, it\u2019s been very hard to get an extension of the half-life refractory. And the zoonotics thing, it sounds like it is the departure from that and could you basically explain why you think it might work and likely to success?","Ludwig Hantson","Well, first of all this is early stage, this is still pre-clinical. And the PSA I think we will extend for the pioneer of highly tested about the same. Maybe the difference here is that it\u2019s biodegradable in our pre-clinical studies with the monkeys, we showed a prolongation by a factor of more than two compared to ADVATE. We\u2019ve been wanting to see what it means in the clinic and what is the chances that you will go all the way, I think you know the signs of biopharmaceuticals in the pre-clinical we believe that it has a lot of value but puts us in the studying in of clinical studies will show we can repeat the execute.","They went from back to maybe what is the most important thing here it is for us it is a belief towards and it\u2019s not about extending the half-life, it is about making sure that we have zero bleeds and you get zero bleed spot extra levels that are high enough, constantly not from the peak and is from that perspective that our approach on gene therapy in hemophilia, we believe could be disruptive and that\u2019s why we want to be a leader in the technology as well.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. So, and my follow-up is just very tactical with regard to saying when I know there were regulatory issues that were out there, how are they looking, is it likely that this will be coming on line in 2015 kind of in a seamless way as planed?","Bob Hombach","Well, we are working with Sanquin on the question, as much as we can. As we also said, the Sanquin volumes are not reflected in our 2014 numbers. And we believe that the guidance that we gave on our ability to grow with the market 6% to 8% that will not be affected for the next couple of years irrespective of the ultimate Sanquin. But we believe that we should be able to work with Sanquin to those questions in our next year most likely have that inputs.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Mary Kay Ladone","And we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. And our final question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just starting with a quick question here, I wanted to \u2013 have you remind us of your expectations for SUPRANE generic competition and what is factored in your guidance for this year for that?","Bob Hombach","Bob, you want to take?","Bob Parkinson","Yeah, we had a modest competitive impact put into our original guidance and given the latest information that we have, we don\u2019t expect much of an impact here. So, it\u2019s largely competitive and out of our guidance here for Suprane. But the delta between our original guidance and where we\u2019re at today is around $10 million or so, if not significant.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay great that\u2019s very helpful. And then, my follow-up is for Ludwig on \u2013 on the long acting recombinant factor VIII market, two things there, one we\u2019ve seen now phase III data from a number of the other competitors Nova as well as Bayer in addition talk to Biogens product. Somewhat if you kind of get your reaction that we\u2019ve seen more phase III data come in on just kind of what you think of the long acting competition maybe how that might relate to your product? And then secondly there, one of the big questions, I mean that\u2019s out there is how pricing in the market might change with the entering of new competitors, particularly competitors who currently don\u2019t have a presence in the market and wanted to get your thoughts on that as well?","Ludwig Hantson","I\u2019ll respond with the pricing question which is going to be a short answer, so I have no comments on that, so no comments here. With respect to your question on LA maybe a couple of observations. The first one is we call them long acting factor VIII products mentioned it several times that we believe that these are not long acting, these are extended half-life products. The half-life is still shorter than one day shorter than RIXUBIS half-life, and I would not call RIXUBIS a long acting product. So that\u2019s number one.","Number two is, the \u2013 what the data shows consistently is that when we\u2019re pushing to dosing regimen towards 5 or 7 days that the data consistently shows that ABRs the annual bleed rate increases. And then we should ask ourself the question, are we doing the right thing for the patient here. Again this is a bleeding disorder with the objective of zero bleed and is not infusion disorder.","So, my answer is that, I do believe that we are on track with what we\u2019re doing with 855 that it is based on the ADVATE molecule that is proven that is shown to be preventive, that is shown to have consistent factor level data irrespective of the ADVATE that is being used. And I believe that we have a very strong platform to work from. So I really feel comfortable with 855 approach in addition to that as I mentioned, I believe that gene therapy could be disruptive, we are of course proof-of-concept in hemophilia B. And with the new acquisition, we are on the lead from the gene therapy perspective across the board broader than we.","So, I\u2019m really comfortable with our strategy, the data as I said for 855 will get this done in second quarter.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Ludwig do you expect to this class of extended half-life products to expand prophylaxis used in hemophilia A and how much did that expand market growth?","Ludwig Hantson","I would say that prophy penetration will increase irrespective of the extended half-life products. We\u2019ve seen this; we\u2019ve seen a significant uptake since we launched ADVATE prophy. We should know that all label shows up to three ADVATE 3 days, and more than 50% of our patients are on 3 days or longer dosing regimen so irrespective of the entry extended half-life products I do believe that the prophy segments will increase over time.","Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Candice. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter financial results and updated outlook for 2016 before taking your questions.","I would just like to remind you that during the Q&A session, please ask just one question and one follow-up, so that we could accommodate others in the queue.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. I will begin this morning by sharing some comments on our performance and progress. Then, I will turn it over to Jay who will take a closer look at the financials and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. After that, we'll open up for Q&A.","We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We continue to see momentum building across the organization as we implement the strategies outlined at our Investor Conference to enhance financial performance through reshaping our portfolio, transforming our cost structure, and effectively deploying capital. As you saw in our press release, Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. These results were driven by continued strong performance of Fluid Systems in U.S. and Peritoneal Dialysis in acute renal therapies globally. Adjusting Baxter's results for the impact of cyclophosphamide in last year's $20 million order of PROTOPAM, sales in the quarter increased 6% globally.","On the bottom line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share. This reflects the benefit of solid sales growth along with our ongoing focus on expense management and operational excellence.","Now I'll take you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where I will address sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.","Global sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.6 billion, increasing 3%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, Hospital Products sales advanced 7% globally, reflecting 13% growth in the U.S. and 1% growth internationally.","Now, to break our Hospital Products at a franchise level, sales in Fluid Systems totaled $576 million, up 11%. These results reflect continued strength in the U.S. driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions along with the strong growth in extra sets resulting from the ongoing successful launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM. Note that this quarter, we anniversary the launch of SIGMA SPECTRUM which is continuing to drive solid performance and increased market share.","Next, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS. Sales were $563 million, decreasing 4%. Excluding cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, sales increased 6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by U.S. nutrition which benefited from a strong sales of vitamins and amino acids as well as our recently launched premixed generic injectable, cefazolin and VANCOMYCIN saline.","In addition, this quarter, we launched NUMETA G13E in Europe. These expand our NUMETA pediatric line with the only ready-to-use triple-chamber IV nutrition product for pre-term infants. NUMETA utilizes Baxter's proprietary olive oil based lipid which has been shown to be immunoneutral thereby reducing the risk of inflammation for the patient. Baxter is the only manufacturer to utilize olive oil based lipids as part of our multi-chamber nutritional product offering.","Moving to Surgical Care which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, third quarter sales totaled $320 million, global growth in the quarter was flat to the prior year with mid-single-digit growth in biosurgery, offset by lower sales of anesthesia products. Anesthesia was impacted by the timing of certain government austerity measures in Europe and the timing of certain shipments internationally. Our industry-leading inhaled anesthetics portfolio continues to represent a solid platform for future growth and global expansion.","Finally, in Hospital Products, BioPharma Solutions, our contract manufacturing business, generated sales of $122 million, an increase of 15%. This growth reflects the benefit of an easier comp for the prior year, along with increased customer demand for products produced in our cytotoxic manufacturing facility in Germany.","Turning next to our Renal business. Renal sales were $977 million globally, up 6%. This reflects ongoing momentum in peritoneal dialysis or PD, which delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. and high-single-digit growth internationally. PD growth is being driven by an expanding patient base, favorable price in the U.S., and the ongoing launches of our new APD cycler, AMIA in the U.S., and HOMECHOICE CLARIA outside the U.S. These systems feature our innovative SHARESOURCE technology which was also recently approved in Japan. SHARESOURCE will be a defining feature for our new (07:38) APD cycler in Japan, which we expect to gain local market approval shortly.","Additionally, Q3 results reflect the positive impact of our acute renal business which delivered double-digit growth globally. This reflects growing global demand for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT, which we're well positioned to address with our market-leading PRISMAFLEX platform. Acute care is a fast-growing market where we have a substantial opportunity to serve patients and clinicians with high-value products, so this will remain a growing area of emphasis as we look ahead.","Growth in Renal was somewhat offset by performance in in-center hemodialysis. We're taking a deliberate approach to improving profitability in our HD business. As you may have seen in our press release yesterday, we launched our novel and proprietary HDx therapy, enabled by our differentiated THERANOVA dialyzer. HDx therapy with THERANOVA has the potential to improve outcomes and raise the standard of treatment for end-stage renal disease patients. It has just launched in France, Australia, New Zealand, and will launch in several other Western European markets before the end of the year.","That's a brief snapshot of our Q3 results. I would like to close my comments by putting our quarterly performance in a broader strategic context. At our Investor Conference in May, we identified three critical drivers that would elevate our performance to top quartile levels: portfolio innovation management, operational excellence, capital allocation.","The results you have seen here today reflect the progress we have made across these three levers. In portfolio and innovation management, we have selectively exited products from certain global markets when our presence and potential were no longer aligned with our go-forward strategy, while ensuring these markets continue to have alternate care options available for the patients. We have also continued our candid assessment of legacy R&D, discontinuing several programs either in non-core areas or where our prospect did not merit projected resources and demands.","Choices like these are enabling us to refocus our investment on high-potential, high-value R&D and on a more strategic sales and marketing opportunities in biosurgery, PD nutrition, premixed injectables, and more.","The third quarter was also a pivotal quarter in our cost transformation efforts. In recent months, we have executed plans to rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure or sale of a number of facilities in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. These actions will streamline and simplify our operations and better position us to manage costs while continuing to address patient and customer needs across the globe.","And earlier this month, we began a wave of organizational restructuring in our global commercial operations and certain other functions, which was the outcome of a rigorous zero-based organizational assessment. This streamline is expected to generate a higher-performing organization along with cost savings that we contemplate in our May Investor Conference. Efforts like this work a leaner cost base, and again, the opportunity to channel investment in new ways.","Innovation is, of course, the most crucial ingredient in our ongoing success, and that you will continue to see capital allocation choices that reinvest in the business to bolster R&D as well as ongoing sustainable top line growth and margin expression. And as you have heard me say repeatedly, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities in our core growth areas and high potential adjacencies.","Any lack of news in this front should be interpreted as a sign of our discipline in assessing deals with strategic fit and financial merit.","So, in sum, our success this quarter represents significant progress on our strategic journey. And while we are pleased, we're not satisfied. We will continue to make progress on our journey to transform Baxter into a top quartile company.","And with that, I will turn over to Jay who will walk you through the financials. Then, we'll open it up for your questions.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results demonstrating continued progress towards achieving our long-term financial goals. Operationally, sales increased 4% in the quarter, and on a reported basis, sales grew 3%. Growth came in at the high end of our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in PD and nutrition therapies.","Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 44.9% represents an improvement of more than 100 basis points over the prior year, driven by a positive sales mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio, and favorable manufacturing performance in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $611 million and decreased 9% on a reported basis. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the benefit from lower pension expense.","TSA income totaled approximately $25 million in the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as a need for these services ramps down, which is expected to be by mid-2017. During the third quarter, we did report a charge of approximately $130 million for restructuring activities, of which approximately $100 million was related to employee termination costs which are expected to generate over $100 million of annual savings once fully implemented. As Joe mentioned, these actions were initiated earlier this month and were contemplated in the long-term financial guidance we provided in May. We will continue to optimize our cost structure as we move forward.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million decreased 8% versus the prior year. While we did benefit in the quarter from the discontinuation of selected programs, we expect to begin redeploying net spend in areas like biosurgery and premixed injectables beginning in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven by positive product mix, lower R&D spend, and the benefit of our initiatives to control spending and reduce expenses. This represents a 480-basis-point improvement over the third quarter of 2015.","Interest expense was $14 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market condition and executed a $1.6 billion, three-tranche debt offering consisting of 5, 10 and 30-year notes. Proceeds from this offering were used to retire a series of existing bonds maturing in the near to intermediate term as well as pay off all of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result of this transaction, Baxter's bond maturity profile increased from an average of 9 years to 15 years, and our average coupon rate declined by nearly 1%.","Adjusted other income totaled $4 million in the quarter, primarily resulting from a foreign exchange gain on a balance sheet position. The adjusted tax rate was 22% for the quarter, slightly higher than expectations, driven by earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.56 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.43 to $0.45 per share.","Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.11 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to a higher share count and tax rate. Along with our equity-for-equity exchange, which we executed in the latter part of the second quarter, during the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $40 million or approximately 1 million shares during the quarter. These repurchases were more than offset by higher-than-expected option-related dilution, given Baxter's stock performance during the quarter.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales, on a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full-year sales for Baxter to increase approximately 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of approximately 5%. On a reported basis including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase approximately 2%. We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 3% to 4%, or approximately 5% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide.","Within the Hospital Products franchises, we expect sales growth of low double digits for Fluid Systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline versus the prior year including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full-year sales forecast for cyclo and now expect full-year sales of $210 million with the assumption that no additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016.","After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS or 4% to 5% excluding the impact of both cyclo and PROTOPAM. Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow approximately 1%.","And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to increase low single digits.","For the Renal business, we now expect full-year sales to increase 4% to 5%, driven by continued growth in our PD and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business.","Moving down the P&L, we now expect an operating margin of approximately 13%. A 100-basis point improvement versus our previous guidance and a 200-basis-point improvement relative to our original guidance. This increase is driven by improved sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses. We expect interest expense to total approximately $70 million. For 2016, we expect other income of approximately $55 million, which does reflect a benefit of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to the disposition of an equity investment.","For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 21%, driven by the expected mix of earnings. For full-year 2016, we anticipate an average share count of 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.88 to $1.91 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share.","Finally, for the year, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion and CapEx of approximately $800 million, resulting in approximately $650 million in free cash flow. This represents an increase of 30% from our original guidance of $500 million. We're applying the same discipline to managing capital expenditures as we are to our expense base, which has resulted in a benefit of approximately $100 million in lower CapEx for the year. In addition, we have initiated programs focused on improving our days payable and days receivable ratios which will benefit operating cash flow going forward.","Specific to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth to increase approximately 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The growth does represent the deceleration from previous quarters, given our previously announced decision to exit select markets outside the U.S.","The collective impact of these exits impacts the top line by approximately 1 percentage point.","In addition, lower cyclo sales compared to the prior year also negatively impact the top line by approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter. Adjusting for these two factors, growth in the quarter would be approximately 4%, which is in line with our long-term projections.","And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share. This guidance reflects increased investment in R&D and incremental investments in SG&A.","With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. So that we may be respectful of everyone's time, please limit your comments to one question with one follow-up question, if necessary. We appreciate everyone's patience and would like to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question. We'll pause for a moment while the list is being compiled. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.","And our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just two quick questions. One on margins and one on CapEx. So, maybe just starting with margins for a second. Just, if I think about the fourth quarter, Jay, I think your guidance of $0.49 to $0.52 kind of implies something around 14% margins. So, two things, what would drive that depression sort of sequentially? And obviously, if you do 16% here in the third quarter versus your sort of 14% to 15% outlook for 2018, how are you feeling about those long-term margin targets, so fourth quarter and obviously the 2018 outlook? And then, I've quick follow-up.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Great. Good morning, David. So, as far as the fourth quarter goes, overall, we were obviously very pleased with the margin performance in the third quarter. So, 16% represents the highest quarterly margin target that we've achieved since the spin-off. As we move to Q4, we do expect a slight downtick in the operating margin of the business, and really there is a couple of drivers to that. One is we are going to be accelerating some R&D investments in both biosurgery and premixed injectables, as I mentioned. So, that will be one factor that increases the R&D spending relative to our current level. And then, the second item relates to SG&A. We do expect a slight uptick as well in SG&A in the fourth quarter as a percent of sales. There's a couple of factors going on there. One is we do have historic seasonality. So, if you look at Baxter over the last many years, we normally have an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter, we do expect that to repeat.","And then, the second factor that's going on with respect to SG&A is one of the topics we discussed in our May Investor Conference relates to what we call local initiatives. The idea that given the diverse geographic portfolio that we have in place and the product portfolio, we really have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by unlocking some of the entrepreneurial spirit outside the U.S. but frankly, that comes with it an SG&A cost. And so, over the course of the last quarter, we have approved a number of investment initiatives which we believe will benefit 2017 and 2018, but do have a slight cost associated with them. So, for these reasons, we do expect a slight downtick as it relates to the overall margin, but again, feel very confident in the operational performance.","As we look to 2017, I think it's too early to get into forecast for 2017. What I can tell you is, in our May Investor Conference, we shared a series of projections for 2018 and 2020. And it is clear, the data points that we have point to accelerated performance relative to those expectations, so we have a higher level of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers and exceed those numbers today than we did when we shared them in May of 2016.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, Jay, very, very helpful. And just one quick follow-up. I think, for me, you hinted this last quarter about the cash flow numbers here, specifically CapEx guidance was fairly kind of remarkable. So, can you help us understand what's driving an $800 million number? I think you gave us $750 million number as the long-term target. So, that's sort of materially, sort of ahead of plan. How much of that is timing? Or does $800 million represent sort of the new normal as we cycle into 2017? Thanks.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. One of the numbers I think the team is most proud of is the free cash flow performance. As I mentioned in the script, we're increasing it from $500 million to $650 million. And really, there's a couple of different components to that. One is operating cash flow, we're raising approximately $50 million, and this is an area where I believe there will be more substantial benefits from some of the programs that we've initiated this year in future years.","So, we're spending a lot of time as a team on working capital, days payable, days sales outstanding, and inventory. How can we drive that down? And those are balances that you don't switch on overnight, but over time with rigor and focus, you can drive a real result in these categories. So, we don't really have much benefit this year but 2017, 2018, 2019, you'll expect to see some meaningful working capital improvements.","Where we were able to drive an impact this year, and frankly I believe this will be sustainable, is in CapEx. We did a couple things this year which I think provided a very real benefit. First, we did a zero-based budget for CapEx, which we review quarterly with our senior leadership teams. So, our top executives at the company sit down on a quarterly basis and the result of that is twofold. One, we did cancel a number of low value-adding programs; but second, for every single program that we had, the challenge to the team was how can we do this more cost effectively. And the results were very, very impressive.","So, the second piece relates to an incentive change that we put into place at the beginning of the year. For our top employees, we have a short-term incentive plan for the top several thousand employees. And last year, there was no cash flow component to this. This year, recognizing the challenge that we face with CapEx being 9% of sales, we installed a free cash flow trigger for our short-term incentive plan. By focusing on free cash flow now, we have our entire organization geared and charging towards driving improvements in this important metric. So, while that's harder to quantify, I believe that that's paid a real dividend in our numbers and creativity as we think about addressing CapEx spending. But frankly, this is one area where I believe we've achieved a new normal and will continue to drive performance from here.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","I'd just like to add one component to Jay's great answer, is that this is a sustainable level of capital. So, this is not one-year conversation. We have changed how we look at capital, how we invest in different places in the world, and also our new technologies, our point-of-care which is solution making on demand, and also how we service emerging markets with on-demand manufacturing of solutions for 100 to 120 patients will change how structurally we seek capital.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch again on the margins and talk a little bit about some of the components that are contributing to the good leverage that you saw in SG&A and gross margin. Could you just articulate what you've sort of done and seen in the plan so far, and then the initiatives that are yet to be really tapped that we could see leverage from in 2018 and beyond?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. Clearly, this was a fabulous quarter for our operating margin, and I would say it was \u2013 contributing to it were gross margin, SG&A leverage and some R&D leverage. From a gross margin standpoint, let's start with that. There were a number of factors in play. We've talked a lot about this concept of portfolio management and business mix and upgrading the business mix. And as we look at the Q3 results from Baxter, you start to see that story playing out. So, for example, we saw very strong performance in our U.S. Hospital business in the sets area and access.","Our sets in the United States grew approximately 20%. That simple business mix factor contributed to our margin, and as we increased the installed base in the United States of SIGMA SPECTRUM, we'll continue to benefit from this mix factor as it moves forward. From an international standpoint, you'll see that we had lower Fluid System sales. But in areas like Renal, in particular, where we had double-digit acute growth and PD growth where we've been very focused on accelerating growth, those are two good margin areas that provided uplift from a business mix standpoint.","And finally, from a business mix standpoint, you heard Joe comment earlier in this call about how we're going to manage in-center HD for profitability, very focused on driving this. So, while that business had lower sales, it had a business mix and from our standpoint, focus on profitability. Those are three examples from a gross margin standpoint where business mix played an impact. The second comment related to gross margin is manufacturing and performance. Overall, we had solid manufacturing performance. We had good volumes in Q2 and Q3. The result of that is a P&L benefit from a manufacturing standpoint. We'll expect to continue driving manufacturing performance going forward, this is a real area of focus for us. How can we effectively utilize our facilities? In Joe's prepared remarks, you heard him referenced, we've closed or sold a number of facilities over the course of this year, that leads to better leveraging of the network.","The final piece related to gross margin is this idea of how can we think creatively about our business arrangements, either through pricing or being thoughtful about the services that we provide. A simple example of this is we're really focused in our U.S. Renal business on limiting the amount of overnight shipping that occurs. For us, that has historically been a real cost that we've borne, and it's impacted our margin. By focusing on that, we're able to drive a better margin. So, those are the three drivers that have impacted our gross margin.","Moving to R&D, we made a couple of tough decisions over the course of this year with respect to project, a project like VIVIA. And so, as a result of that, we saw a lower R&D spending in the quarter. Now to my earlier comment, I do expect an uptick in this as we start to reinvest in some exciting new areas for us that have nearer-term paybacks than the VIVIA project. But in the quarter, this idea of rigorous capital allocation did play out in the R&D spend.","And then finally, from the SG&A standpoint, I would make a couple of comments here. First, this idea of zero-based spending, challenging every single dollar that we have in place, that's something that the company has adopted from a process standpoint. So, as we went through our budgeting process this year, we had a very rigorous zero-based spending approach, a zero-based organization approach in place applying these techniques to our cost structure.","But I think beyond that, culturally, the entire organization is incredibly aware of spending and driving results. The number of ideas that we're generating from our organization at large, with respect to the simplification, with respect to savings ideas, is remarkable. And that simple phenomena has played out in our SG&A numbers for the quarter.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Maybe just one follow-up. You've had a lot of momentum in the pumps. Can you talk a little bit about how durable that could be as you continue to kind of gain back share there, and whether that's going to create any headwind for you in 2017 as you try to grow over these strong placed (33:43) numbers?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We had a very good performance in SPECTRUM since its launch about a year ago. We gain market share. We're back to number two position in the market. And clearly, that was a very rapid penetration. We don't see the same rate of penetration going forward, but we continue to see us gaining market share in this large volume pump market in the U.S.","We're also very committed to this pump business and technology, and we will be continuing to invest resources in developing not only the portfolio for the U.S. but also for outside the U.S. But to the point of comparables, we are coming to the point we are anniversarying our pump launch, so clearly we cannot expect this business to continue to deliver growth in the 20-plus percent every quarter.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the comment.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, congrats on a great quarter. Maybe one near-term and one medium-term question. Obviously, phenomenal 3Q numbers. When you look at the fourth quarter numbers, right, an organic of 2%, that's a sequential decel, I'm just going to \u2013 what kind of cycle assumptions do we have? Can you just give some clarity on the top line, please?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes. So, overall, there is essentially two drivers of the deceleration in the fourth quarter. One is cyclo. While we don't \u2013 we're not anticipating an incremental competitor in cyclophosphamide, we do expect lower levels than prior year. It's down about $20 million or roughly 1 point of growth, to $45 million in the quarter. So, that's a deceleration that we've expected and kind of consistent with how we thought about things.","As we look at the other area that has impacted our Q4 result, we have always talked about this idea of rigorously going through our portfolio and ensuring that every single sale that we make is one that contributes positively to the economics of Baxter. And so, in support of that, we did walk away from roughly $130 million in sales on an annual basis, which amounts to roughly 1 point of growth impact in the quarter.","Now, the good news is this has limited to no impact on the bottom line. The sales were essentially breakeven, and we've been able to eliminate all the costs associated with those sales. So, while on the bottom line there's no impact, it does impact the top line a bit. If I were to adjust for these two factors, the 2% growth would be more like our normal expected run rate growth of 4%.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Great, Jay. And then, maybe a quick follow-up on \u2013 sticking to the theme of top line. And I guess one of the feedback we get from investors is, look, I mean the company has \u2013 they've done a phenomenal job on the cost side, on the margins and EPS growth. At the end of this \u2013 the products, there's always \u2013 it's hard to model a company when you have so many SKUs. What gives you the confidence that Baxter could be 4% to 5%, when you look at the next two to three years, can you talk about when we can annualize some of the in-center HD business on the Renal side and some of these growth initiatives can kick in? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Vijay, this is our challenge, and I think we are on our way to create that environment. First thing we did was completely reallocate capital. If I showed today to you the dollars invested by franchising the company versus 12 months ago, you'll see a significant difference. We are doubling down in areas like biosurgery, it's going to take us a couple of years to pick up momentum there because we fell behind in a lot of different things, but we are looking at some M&A augmentation for the short term.","We also are doubling down in the PD business, the peritoneal dialysis business. I have great confidence that we're going to unveil a very different model of doing business in some parts of the world. We're working with payers at this moment, and I think that will be a very interesting way of expanding the use of PD, which has proven to be, economically and from the access point of view, a better way forward for the patient and for the system. And with SHARESOURCE, we're going to continue to invest there.","I see us very focused on the M&A area associated with organic growth in our generic injectable business. We think we have a platform opportunity at the moment, plus our internal growth engines in terms of new molecules, which we're accelerating. So, all of this gives me the confidence that we can achieve 4% to 5% in a couple of years.","I tell you, we are trimming our portfolio. We're removing a significant amount of unprofitable dollars, which will boost our 2017 bottom line, but cleaning up the portfolio and simplifying Baxter is also part of the playbook. So, the playbook is innovation, really good capital allocation practices, use our capital dollars in the way that was different in the past. As you can see, our free cash flow numbers will allow us to generate more profitability for the company.","And lastly, when we talk about transformation, it's not just cost reduction and reduction of personnel, but is also the complete restructuring of the company in terms of its processes. Baxter grew up to be a very complicated company with a lot of SKUs, and we're working very hard to the Office of the Business Transformation to redo that. So, that accumulation of factors give us pretty good odds of hitting the numbers, we just need to continue forth with a lot of tenacity to achieve what we set forth to do.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, and congrats as well on the quarter. Jay, I wanted to just clarify, in the footnotes on some of the charges that were taken this quarter. It talks about $25 million of costs to implement business optimization programs, and that includes consultants and employees' salaries. So, just maybe walk through why are those costs backed out of adjusted earnings?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean. Look, Mike, there are a couple of major programs, kind of onetime programs that we have ongoing which we don't expect to be permanent costs in place. And so, for example, we have a, what we call, our Project Touchstone which is related to the implementation of a global business service center. It really is not part of our ongoing operations. We do not have the expertise to do this ourselves. So, we have brought in some consultants to assist in this process, and we have some employees dedicated to this process \u2013 to the project, I should say.","At some point, once implementation is complete, those costs will all go away and they will benefit future periods, not current period. So, that's just one example of a number of programs that we have in place which are not really a part of our ordinary operations, which we've chosen to special out.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. Maybe I should go to (42:07) Joe on this. Joe, if I think about the pushback I hear from people just kind of on how the story has evolved here, it really revolves around just the idea that the success the company is seeing is almost like a playbook of what we'd saw earlier from spec pharma companies where they took some otherwise mature, older products, raised some prices and cut some costs. And that drove a rise in profitability in the short-term. How do you evolve the story from being one of growth and earnings growth off of the instant price increasing and cost cutting at the front end to one that's a more sustainable top and bottom line story?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Mike, we don't have the portfolio of a spec pharma company. So, our playbook is not quite the same. Do we have...","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I did say \u2013 I said the comments are really focused on the price increases in the Fluid Systems and the PD businesses.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","So, I was going to add that our pricing to date is slightly over 1.1% of our growth. So, it's a fraction of the overall growth. Do we have price increases? We do have price increases like many companies. But its sustainability, what I see in the long term, is neutral to a slight positive on pricing. So, I want to make that very clear.","The other thing is how do you sustain that top line with transforming the gross margin contribution in participating markets that have higher growth rates than our current one is using the playbook we're using today. So, going into premixed and going into perhaps the manufacturing of very difficult to make KPIs, give us gross margins much, much different than we current today have in terms of average for the company.","So, we will double down on that. So, Jay's comments in the very beginning about redeploying of R&D in the fourth quarter is actually doubling down in all the programs that we have in bringing new molecules to premixed using our capability of, we call, the GALAXY.","Looking into adjacencies and doubling the amount of R&D in biosurgery is another sustainable way of being in this business. Creating local initiatives that we are and right now we have more than probably 70 local initiatives in all countries. Remember, Baxter is 60% outside U.S. sales, and we had put in place a franchise system as a company that completely took away the ability of our local and regional businesses to operate a little bit more independent. And we have great opportunities and we totaled (45:18) significant amount of money in the next three to four years that will sustain our top line, revamping our R&D organization to be more focused by business than focus in overall company.","So, there's significant amount of things we're doing that are not related directly to price, but eventually plays a role in pricing because your mix will be different if products have higher margin and will change the profile of the company. It's not an easy thing to do, but we're working very hard to do it right. Hence, one of the things that we haven't rushed into doing was acquiring companies, we want to make sure that we have the discipline to acquire the companies, where it matters and be strategically accretive to our business.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you very much. Can you hear me okay?","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes, we can, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Congratulations on a great margin performance. So, I wanted to focus both of my questions on the margin performance. And Joe, maybe I'll start with you, and then a question for Jay to follow up. So, Joe, I was just wondering if you could kind of characterize the outperformance on margins from a big picture perspective. What I'm curious about is how much of this outperformance is basically pull-forward of margin opportunities that you anticipated in the long-range plan, versus finding new areas of savings that were not originally anticipated in the LRP? So, I'm just kind of curious how much of this is pull-forward versus finding new opportunities.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Well, Bob, you answered 50% of your own question. We got accelerated programs in place, and we're getting faster results on our zero-based organization, zero-based budget and zero-based spending, okay, so we pull things forward. But we also have come across a significant amount of opportunities that we initially did not anticipate. So, I see us building a lot of confidence in probably over achieving our targets, and I say that with no hesitation. I would say also that there is a portion of our restructuring that is more complex, which is the outsourcing and labor arbitration that is involved in changing our back-office profile. But based in what I did in my past and looking at what we're doing today, there is a vast difference in our approach, and I truly believe that our people will be able to do what we set forth to do at the savings that we've set or even better.","So, things are coming together very well. One thing I want to give credit to Baxter and the Baxter management and Baxter employees is once we set our compass to the right direction here, they really execute very quickly, I was surprised how much momentum we got out of simplification and savings. So, the folks of our company have done a phenomenal job embracing this change, and those are not easy changes to make.","So, in summary, we are happy with the result and satisfied by the way. And it does give us confidence that probably we will over achieve on our long-range plan targets.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for that. I appreciate that. And then, Jay, a little more short-term oriented question around the fourth quarter guidance. You characterized the fourth quarter margin guidance as a slight downtick from Q3, but unless I'm doing my math wrong, it looks like operating margins will come down 200 basis points to 300 basis points in Q4 versus Q3. So, I guess I'm just curious, one, do I have my math right? And two, were there any onetimers in Q3 in that 16% or is that a clean number? And then, maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about the increase in spending in R&D from Q3 to Q4. Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, look, 16%, great quarter, we were really happy with it. The full year, we expect, to be around 13%. And so, while there weren't onetimers in place, we do expect to see a, what I call, downtick, you call 200 basis points to 300 basis points of deterioration in the fourth quarter, which I think is fair. And as I said, there's a couple of factors, right? It's probably split roughly evenly between R&D and SG&A. From an R&D standpoint, one of the areas we really want to accelerate and we recognize investments today will yield dividends in a couple years relates to biosurgery. So, we've started to accelerate spending there. There were a number of programs that will begin in earnest in the fourth quarter that will facilitate that.","And then to Joe's comment earlier, this point-of-care, another very exciting development for us. It's got a lot of benefits for the patients. It's a great program for us. It also allows us to run a capital-light model relative to the historic way of delivering PD solutions to patients.","So, very exciting developments, but they have a cost associated with them. We do expect to see that impact on margin by 1 point roughly. And then, SG&A, it's maybe a little bit more than that. For us, Q3 was a low level of SG&A spending.","The Q4 number, we're expecting to move back up to roughly the Q2 level. We would historically expect to see a Q4 uptick. Q3 is typically a lower SG&A spend quarter in part because of the August month, which is a holiday in many parts of the world. So, for us, we're being prudent and thinking about an uptick in spending to occur in the fourth quarter.","But then to the last point, we've got to accelerate the top line. That is a clear charge of our entire company and that takes some investment as well.","We have empowered our international organization to begin spending on a number of initiatives. There's no impact on the sales line related to these of note in 2016. But these investments will start to pay dividends and self fund in 2017 and 2018. So, very exciting development there. Good investments to make. We track and monitor these investments on a monthly and quarterly basis, but in combination, these elements lead to a deterioration, slight deterioration from this 16% level.","Having said all of that, to Joe's point, we shared some projections in May of 2016, for margin in 2018, we said 14% to 15%; in 2020, we said 17% to 18%. We have a higher likelihood of over achieving those numbers as we sit here today. That's clear.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Brooks.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Good morning. So, I had a question, trying to tease out organic growth opportunities more on the Hospital Products side of the business, and I'm specifically looking at the difference in performance between the U.S. and international businesses.","So, Jay, I wonder, can you \u2013 do you have a sense for the underlying growth rate if you back out either the product lines or the geographies that you're exiting in that business?","And then secondly, if you look at organic growth opportunities within Hospital Products, can you talk about even just getting the entire portfolio approved in all geographies, can you help us understand kind of the organic growth opportunity within, and I guess I'm thinking more injectables and nutrition? That's question number one.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Look, the overall Hospital business \u2013 as far as the exits that took place, it actually was slightly tilted towards Renal. So, we looked at the India business, we made some decisions related to IVs and PD. In Turkey, we looked at our clinics business along with the IV business there. But on balance, I would say slightly more of an impact in Renal than it was in the Hospital business.","And to be clear, we've had outstanding performance in the U.S. Hospital business, right? The 6% growth has been quite good, and internationally the growth is below that. And so, you ask a great question which is, how do we accelerate growth outside the U.S.? The U.S. has benefited from a number of factors which are not quite present internationally. We've had the benefit of a new product launch, the SIGMA SPECTRUM pump. We've had very solid performance coming from our nutrition business, and we've seen sort of adequate performance coming out of our Surgical Care business. But the real standout performance comes from the U.S. Fluid Systems business.","Outside the U.S., we have not had the benefit of a product launch like we've had in the U.S., and so for us, how do we address some new products perhaps from a business development standpoint outside the U.S., for example, in the Fluid Systems business? That's a real challenge and opportunity for us as we look to accelerate performance outside the U.S.","In addition, our nutrition business, which in the quarter in the United States grew in double digits, grew in low single digits outside the U.S. And so, for us, another real area of focus has been accelerating the nutrition performance outside the U.S., and that will continue to be an area where we'll invest some of the investment initiatives are targeting nutrition growth outside the U.S.","So, those are a few of the factors. I mean it's kind of a difficult question to answer in a sense that it really is multi-product, multi-geography but it's safe to say that accelerating performance \u2013 Renal outside the U.S. has seen outstanding performance. 5% for the quarter, that was a very solid performance for us. Accelerating the Hospital outside the United States becomes a core area of focus for us, in particular, as we move to 2017.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's helpful. And then, I guess as a follow-up, you've talked about M&A but really haven't pulled the trigger on anything yet. And I know Joe mentioned earlier some of that is internal timing, but can you talk about the barriers that you see to doing M&A? I mean, is it scarcity of assets? Is it pricing? What's the opportunity and what's really holding you back from pulling the trigger? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We have targets that are probably in the number of between 10 and 15 that we have in front of us at any given time. So, it's not a scarcity of targets. And now, we have a strategy that is driving our seeking companies and seeking businesses and technologies. So now, we have the right construct here which is a strategy-driving M&A.","We are extremely disciplined when it comes to how we look at our shareholders money. And the ability to drive value is fundamentally important to us. So, at the moment, we are looking at three specific targets that we think have good value for the company. The competition sometimes is irrational about how people are paying for some of the targets. And we don't go there. We don't want to be part of that group. We want to make sure that everything that we pay for has a way of paying back to the company and to the shareholders. So, we are very diligent. I meet with the team every month, every other week we've got updates. We just hired our new head of M&A. He started with us about a week and a half ago. Very talented.","We'll not \u2013 I want our investors to understand that we are very focused on that, but we will never forget our responsibility in managing our shareholders' money. We don't see it is as our money, it's our shareholders'. So, we're going to make sure that investments we make are very well thought out.","I also challenge our team internally to think a little broader when people look at acquisitions and make sure that we understand all the value is being captured. So, this has been a learning curve for Baxter. We have not done that in the past and I think it is a good practice. So, as we get more mature, we're probably going to see some things happening in the future.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I heard the comment earlier about getting to 4% to 5% growth in a couple of years, but I just wanted to focus first on 2017. Can you talk about some of the headwinds and tailwinds investors should think about? We estimate that cyclo and exiting low-margin sales could be about a 200-basis-point headwind next year. Are in the right ballpark?","And the 2016 to 2018 sales CAGR you provided at the May Investor Meeting was 3% to 4%, I believe. Is there any reason why you can't do 3% to 4% in 2017? And I did have one follow-up. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We're not going to talk about 2017 today. What I want to tell you is that we will remove sales from the top line, which are unprofitable today. And that is our responsibility. So, we do have the long-term objective of growing the business and the underlying business will grow 3% to 4%.","The thing is, we will need to remove some sales. We're doing business in locations that we should not be doing business. We've been there for a long time but has not panned out to be a good business. And the worst thing that we can have is to keep a business afloat that is on the marginal contribution is eroding value to the company. So, we will take the measures that we want to take and make sure that anything that we do will have the intentions of making the company stronger in the future. So, for us, to deliver our bottom line, we will have to take some of this business off line, and I have no problems with that.","But at the same time, we are very focused in investing in the right R&D programs to be able to create the momentum to bring the top line to the 3% to 4%, eventually 4% to 5%. So, this is our job, number one right now is to work on top line growth, but we will revamp and repurpose our portfolio, so we are not here sitting three, four years from today with massive unwanted businesses that we should have taken action before.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Very clear, Joe. Just a follow-up on capital allocation. You've talked about bringing your net debt-to-EBITDA level to about 2 times in the next couple of years. Is there any timeline on when you expect to be at 2 times? And how do you strike the balance between waiting for the right deal to come along versus returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases? Thanks for taking the questions.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you. We're very happy with our progress on free cash flow. And we see with better management of our capital, we will see probably a better performance than we have spoken to our investors back in May. With that said, it gives us a good ability to deploy this capital in acquisitions. So, we will have not a timeline fixed to get to a 2.0 times. We will get there when we get there. I tell you, it can be in one shot. It can be in several shots.","But we are really focused in bringing our balance sheet to a place that we can either do two things, choose to deliver capital to our shareholders in form of buyback, and I think that is a very possible avenue, combined with a healthy M&A strategy because we are very happy with how our free cash flow and our capital spending is progressing.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference with Baxter International.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Norbert Riedel, Chief Science and Innovation Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thanks for calling in. We're pleased today to announce our financial results for the first quarter and also provide you with an update on our full year 2012 outlook. As you all saw in our press release that was issued earlier this morning, EPS of $1.01 per diluted share exceeded our guidance and increased 3% versus the prior year on an adjusted basis.","First quarter sales after adjusting for FX increased 4% and exceeded our sales growth guidance of approximately 2%. Our strong financial position continues to provide us the flexibility to make investments to grow our core product portfolio, expand further in developing and emerging markets, advance our pipeline, and pursue opportunities that will position us for the future all with an eye toward delivering enhanced value to our shareholders.","R&D increased 10% this quarter, as our sustained focus on innovation has afforded us with a meaningful new product pipeline that's as strong today as any time in our history. And I remain encouraged with the progress we're making, which has resulted in a number of recent accomplishments that I'd like to briefly highlight this morning. ","First of all, within our leading hemophilia franchise, we've achieved a number of milestones. As you know ADVATE was approved in December by the FDA as the only recombinant Factor VIII prophylactic treatment for both children and adults. This approval was based on a study demonstrating that ADVATE significantly reduced median annual bleed rates from 44 bleeds when treated on demand to 1 when treated prophylactically, and included the approval of a new dosing schedule that offer some patients the choice of fewer infusions versus the current standard prophylaxis regimen.","The initial response from customers has been very positive as evidenced by the strong double-digit growth of ADVATE in the United States during the first quarter. We remain encouraged regarding the long-term growth prospects of our hemophilia franchise as we've secured both competitive gains and conversions from on-demand therapy to prophylaxis, and will continue to invest in additional marketing activities to promote our competitive advantage and drive awareness of this expanded label.","Also in hemophilia, we announced the initiation of a Phase I clinical trial of BAX 855, a longer-acting PEGylated Factor VIII therapy based on the full-length ADVATE molecule. The Phase I results will serve as the foundation for advancing this important program through clinical development and determining whether BAX 855 can offer a treatment regimen requiring fewer infusions than ADVATE.","In our regenerative medicine business, we initiated a Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an individual's own CD34+ stem cells to increase exercise capacity in patients with Chronic Myocardial Ischemia or CMI. CMI is one of the most severe forms of coronary artery disease causing significant long-term damage to the heart muscle and disability to the patient. It's often diagnosed based on symptoms of severe chest discomfort that do not respond to conventional medical management or surgical interventions.","In addition, in the quarter, we received approval for TISSEEL fibrin sealant for vascular surgery providing a broad hemostasis label in the United States. This is an expansion beyond previously marketed indications and represents a significant opportunity for this franchise going forward.","In Antibody Therapies, we filed GAMMAGARD LIQUID for use in treating multifocal motor neuropathy or MMN, representing our first neurological indication in the United States. If approved, GAMMAGARD LIQUID will be the first and only licensed immunoglobulin therapy for MMN in the U.S., where we've been granted orphan drug status by the FDA. This will complement the approval we received last year for MMN in Europe.","Also, we initiated a second global Phase III trial evaluating the use of GAMMAGARD LIQUID in treating patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease following a successful futility analysis that was conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring Board in January. This trial complements our first Phase III trial, which is fully enrolled and will conclude by the end of 2012.","We've also announced an extensive study for those patients who completed 18 months of treatment in the first Alzheimer's Phase III trial and meet the clinical -- or the required inclusion and exclusion criteria. This study is intended to provide additional data related to the longer-term safety efficacy and pharmacoeconomic impact of immunoglobulin treatment in these patients. ","These achievements that I just mentioned depict just a handful of the programs in our pipeline that will present great opportunities for Baxter in the years to come. And we look forward to updating you on further R&D achievements as the year unfolds.","Before I turn the call over to Bob in just 1 minute, I'd like to comment on the announcement this week regarding HyQ, and also the one issued this morning regarding the site selection of our new plasma fractionation facility to support future growth of plasma proteins. ","First, we remain very positive regarding the long-term growth prospects of our plasma-based specialty therapeutics business including GAMMAGARD LIQUID, FLEXBUMIN, FEIBA, ARALAST and GLASSIA. As you know, many of these therapies are used in treating diseases that continue to be both under-treated and under-diagnosed globally. Our continued confidence stems from our global market position, the safety and efficacy profile that our products command, and our unique differentiation strategy focused on new delivery options, expanded indications, and broadening access to care in developing markets. ","While we're committed to supporting global market demand in the near term, we've selected a site in Covington, Georgia for a new state-of-the-art plasma fractionation facility to support longer-term growth. Construction will begin this year and will include operations supporting plasma fractionation, purification, fill-finish and a testing lab. Commercial production is scheduled to begin in 2018 with the new fractionation facility, adding up to 3 million leaders of new capacity annually when fully operational. The investment at the Georgia site is expected to total more than $1 billion over the next 5 years, and provide us with the flexibility and necessary infrastructure to expand even further in support of additional global market needs.","Second, earlier this week, as you know, Baxter and Halozyme announced that the FDA has requested additional information to complete its regulatory review of HyQ. The agency is requesting additional data on the use of hyaluronidase for chronic administration, specifically in relation to the HyQ Biologics License Application. ","Just to be clear, there were no safety concerns cited by the FDA with respect to immunoglobulin therapy which, as you know, has a well-established safety profile and has been approved for chronic administration for patients with primary immunodeficiencies. ","Baxter and Halozyme intend to work closely together to further understand the FDA's request and develop a plan to provide additional data. In addition, we expect to participate in a future meeting of the FDA's Blood Products Advisory Committee to obtain clarification on next steps. In light of this request, we now expect a delay in the anticipated regulatory review and approval timeline, which could delay the launch of HyQ beyond 2012.","As you know, the change in the anticipated timeline for approval of HyQ is not material -- financially material to our 2012 guidance. And of course, as we obtain additional information, we'll continue to update all of you on our plans and expectations.","As always, I'd be happy to address any questions you might have on that or other topics during the Q&A this morning. But first, I'd like to ask Bob to review our first quarter financial results and also our guidance for 2012. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the first quarter, excluding special items, increased 3% to $1.01 per diluted share, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.98 to $1. As mentioned in the press release, our GAAP results included a net after-tax benefit from special items totaling $19 million of income or $0.03 per diluted share for costs and adjustments related to recent business development transactions. Specifically, we recorded a special after-tax charge totaling $34 million or $0.06 per diluted share, primarily related to the upfront cash payment to Momenta for the development and commercialization of biosimilar compounds. This charge was more than offset by a gain of $53 million or $0.09 per diluted share, resulting from an adjustment to estimated milestone payments associated with the 2011 Prism Pharmaceutical's acquisition.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the first quarter before turning to our financial outlook for 2012. Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled $3.4 billion in the first quarter and increased 3%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 4%, which exceeded our sales growth guidance of approximately 2%. Better-than-expected sales materialized in a number of key product categories in both Medical Products and BioScience, and we also benefited from the Synovis acquisition, which closed earlier than planned. As a reminder, the benefit from recent acquisitions, which includes Synovis and Baxa, was partially offset by the divestiture of the U.S. multisource generic injectables business. The net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures on sales in the quarter was less than $20 million.","In terms of individual business performance, beginning with BioScience. Global Bioscience sales of approximately $1.5 billion increased 4% in the first quarter, and excluding foreign currency, sales increased 5%. Within the product categories, recombinant sales rose 4% and totaled $533 million. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 5% as double-digit growth of 10% in the U.S. was partially offset by the impact of the Australian tender. Excluding the impact of the tender, recombinant sales increased 8%. As Bob mentioned, we're very pleased with the strength of our U.S. business, where we are deriving benefits associated with the new expanded label of ADVATE.","Moving onto plasma proteins. Sales in the quarter were $316 million and increased 3% versus the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4%. U.S. sales declined 3% due in part to lower plasma-derived Factor VIII sales resulting from the continued conversions to recombinant therapies and lower sales of albumin as we aggressively manage our global supply. This resulted in strong growth in plasma proteins outside the U.S. driven by double-digit growth of albumin, particularly in China and robust demand for FEIBA.","In Antibody Therapy, sales of $388 million increased 4%. Excluding foreign currency, sales were up 5% as we continue to experience very strong demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID, particularly in the U.S. And we remain well positioned given our successful launch of our SubQ therapy, where we continue to see momentum in share gains, given its favorable tolerability profile and low infusion site reaction rate.","In addition, as you know, Octapharma returned to the market on a global basis last year. As previously communicated, the estimated benefit of the Octapharma impact in the first quarter 2011 was approximately $30 million. Excluding the benefit from the prior year, growth in Antibody Therapy was 14% on a constant currency basis, significantly higher than estimated market growth, suggesting that we've retained market share on a global basis that was gained during Octa's absence.","In the first quarter, sales in regenerative medicine, which includes our BioSurgery products, totaled $154 million and increased 10%. Excluding foreign currency, sales grew 11% as a result of double-digit growth of FLOSEAL and the incremental benefit from the Synovis acquisition of just over $10 million.","Finally, revenues in the other category totaled $71 million in the quarter and declined 4%. Excluding foreign currency, sales declined 3% as growth of vaccines were offset by lower third-party plasma revenues.","In Medical Products, global sales in the first quarter totaled $1.9 billion, reflecting an increase of 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis. ","Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $588 million and were comparable to the prior year period. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 1%, as U.S. PD growth accelerated to mid-single digits supported by solid patient gains. This momentum was offset by lower HD revenues.","IV Therapies sales advanced 10% to $472 million. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 12% driven by higher demand for IV Therapies in the U.S., strong performance globally of our nutrition franchise and the benefit of the Baxa acquisition with sales totaling approximately $35 million.","Sales in the Global Injectables category of $505 million declined 2% on both the reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the net headwind of $30 million from Baxa and the impact of the U.S. multisource generic injectables divestiture, organic growth was in mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. Performance was driven by our pharma partnering and compounding businesses, as well as significant growth of certain injectable therapeutics like cyclophosphamide, a generic oncology drug.","Infusion system sales totaled $208 million and declined 1% on both the reported and constant currency basis. This expected decline was a result of lower access set sales, as we complete the transition to Spectrum and near completion of the COLLEAGUE consent order. ","Finally, our anesthesia franchise posted robust sales of $138 million, reflecting a 17% increase versus the prior year. Excluding foreign currency, sales were up 18%. While growth was enhanced by easy comparison to the prior year, we did experience very solid demand for both Sevoflurane and Suprane on a global basis. This growth in volume more than offset continued pricing pressures for generic Sevoflurane.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin for the company was 50.8%, in line with our expectations and lower than last year's gross margin by 20 basis points. Margin expansion resulting from mixed benefits was more than offset by headwinds, including incremental pension expense, austerity measures and dilution from business development transactions.","SG&A totaled $743 million in the quarter and increased 4% versus the prior year period as a result of incremental pension expense, promotional and marketing expenses, and investments we're making to enhance our global presence, particularly in emerging and developing markets. These investments were partially offset by business optimization savings and aggressive management of discretionary spending.","R&D spending accelerated 10% to $236 million as we continue to fund and advance a number of late-stage programs, including investments in our leading hemophilia franchise, Alzheimer's program and our Phase III adult stem cell trial.","The operating margin in the quarter was 21.9%, 80 basis points below the prior year due to lower gross margin and higher SG&A and R&D that's expected to enhance future sales growth and profitability.","Interest expense was $18 million compared to $10 million last year. This increase can be attributed to interest expense associated with the $500 million debt issuance in December of last year and lower interest income.","Other income totaled $4 million in the quarter compared to expense of $11 million last year, driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency.","The tax rate was 21.7% in the quarter, which is higher than our prior year due to a change in our earnings mix and slightly higher than our full year expectation.","And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted EPS was $1.01 per diluted share, an increase of 3%.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $413 million and increased 11% versus last year. Capital expenditures totaled $239 million, which compares to $198 million in the first quarter of 2011. DSO ended the quarter at 58 days, an increase of 2 days versus the prior year entirely due to an increase in international days outstanding. Inventory turns of 2.3 were essentially unchanged from the first quarter last year.","And lastly, during the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock for $575 million, or on a net basis, approximately 7 million shares for $421 million, on track to achieve our full year objective of net share repurchases totaling approximately $1 billion.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2012.","First, for the full year, we have narrowed our guidance range and now expects earnings of $4.49 to $4.57 per diluted share. By line item of the P&L starting with sales, we continue to project full year sales growth excluding foreign currency of 4% to 5%. Given our current outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to negatively impact the top line by 2 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported sales growth, which includes the impact of foreign currency, to be in the 2% to 3% range. We continue to expect full year gross margin rate for the company to be flat to modestly below the 2011 gross margin of 51.4%. We expect SG&A and R&D to grow in low- to mid-single digits. Interest expense is expected to total approximately $80 million and other expense, including noncontrolling interests, will be in the $20 million to $30 million range.","We assume a tax rate of approximately 21.5%, flat with 2011 and now expect a full year average share count of approximately 555 million, which assumes approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases.","From a cash flow perspective, we plan to generate cash flow from operations of more than $3 billion, which includes an outflow of approximately $250 million related to the finalization of the COLLEAGUE consent order.","Now to expand on full year sales assumptions for each of the businesses. First, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect Medical Products sales to grow in the mid-single digits. This includes IV Therapies sales growth of approximately 10%, which includes the benefit of approximately $120 million in sales related to the Baxa acquisition. Anesthesia sales growth in high-single digits reflecting the strong performance in the first quarter. Global Injectables sales growth in mid-single digits, which includes the net benefit of Baxa sales totaling approximately $40 million and the divestiture impact of approximately $60 million. Infusion System sales, which are expected to decline approximately 5% and reflect a tough comparison for SIGMA as we complete the consent order later this year. And lastly, renal sales growth is expected to be in low-single digits.","For BioScience, we project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, in the mid-single digits and there's no change to our original guidance by product category. Our outlook includes recombinant sales growth in low-single digits, reflecting the impact of recent tenders; plasma protein sales growth in mid-single digits; Antibody Therapy sales growth in low single digits, which includes robust underlying demand and the impact from Octapharma. ","I'd like to take just a moment to point out that in the second quarter, we face our most difficult year-on-year comparison for Antibody Therapy as sales increased 21% on a constant currency basis. And as you know, we expect to continue to improve our inventory position in advance of our third quarter shutdown of the old L.A. fractionation facility. Therefore, our expectations include an assumption that global antibody therapy sales will be lower in Q2 this year versus the prior year period.","Moving on to regenerative medicine. We expect sales growth of approximately 20%, which includes incremental sales from Synovis of approximately $75 million. And finally, the other category is expected to decline approximately 5%.","As mentioned in our press release, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.10 to $1.12 and sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 3% to 4%. Based on our outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to impact sales by approximately 3 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported sales to grow in the 0% to 1% range.","Thanks, and now I would like to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter international website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually James in for David. My first question is on the new capacity plant in Georgia, a couple points there. One, I think given the 3-million-liter capacity, total spend in CapEx of $1 billion is a little bit more than we're expecting. Can you give any details on -- whether that also includes additional purification capacity? And is that -- would that be able to -- could you expand that capacity beyond 3 million liters with the infrastructure that you're putting in place? Second, 3 million liters actually seems a little bit less than we are expecting to meet your capacity needs over the long term. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to bridge to that new facility with the existing capacity at the old and new L.A. facilities?","Robert L. Parkinson","James, let me -- this is Bob Parkinson. Let me maybe kind of address your question at a higher level, and then I'm going to turn it to Bob Hombach to take you through maybe some of the elements of the CapEx spending that we projected. First of all, just to back up a bit, if you look at our current plans with old L.A., putting it back in commission, as well as some expansion opportunities at new L.A., Vienna and Rieti, we certainly feel that our installed footprint of capacity can support, say, 6% to 8% kind of growth over the next few years, setting the stage, then longer term for the capacity expansion that we announced this morning. I would say the announcement this morning, first of all, is an expression -- I think, represents our confidence in the long-term global growth of the Plasma Protein business. A little bit of context, over half the world's population remains undiagnosed and certainly under-treated for many of the conditions that are treated today with therapeutic proteins, and being the world leader in this area, the announcement this morning is really an investment for the long term and speaks to our confidence in the business. As Bob will explain to you in a minute, the magnitude of the investment represents more than the initial phase of 3 million liters but sets the stage for the kind of expansion over time that supports the kind of addition that I just described. So with that as context, Bob, I'll let you maybe give a little more detail in terms of the breakout. Okay?","Robert J. Hombach","Sure. Yes, in terms of capacity and investments in capacity, historically, you've seen us both on additional capacity expansions on the existing footprint, and I think others in the industry. This announcement today represents a true greenfield site, where we are going to be putting infrastructure in place in addition to, and we were very careful to point this out in the press release, it is fractionation capacity, it is purification capacity, and it is fill-finish capacity, and an additional testing lab, which is another requirement in the overall plasma fractionation process that we need to have in place. So we are adding all elements in one location here whereas historically, you may have heard additional capacity investments talk about in a piecemeal fashion. As we look at this investment, approximately 30% of this investment relates to infrastructure. And as Bob just mentioned, that infrastructure will support both this initial 3 million in capacity but also significantly more capacity in the future. And by making the investment now, it will position us to add that additional capacity in the future at a lower marginal cost and in a much more timely fashion than this greenfield site is going to take for us to bring out.","Robert L. Parkinson","Does that answer your question?","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That absolutely addresses my question, very helpful. And then the second is just on recombinant. Obviously, very strong growth in the U.S. this quarter. I was wondering, do you think that represents true -- presumably, that's growing faster than market at 10% figure. Do you think that represents more patient share gains and that patients are switching to ADVATE, or does it represent higher dosing and maybe a little bit more use of prophylaxis among your existing patients?","Robert L. Parkinson","I'm not sure, at this stage, we know. I think that it probably represents some of each of those elements that you just described, James. So I think it's too early to be able to quantify which of those variables is the most pronounced. But we know specifically that, on a patient-by-patient basis, that we are gaining conversions, one, from competition and then two, expansion and use of ADVATE given the broader label. So as we stated in our prepared comments, early start, but it's quite encouraging.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And maybe I can just get one more in on SubQ. I mean even if HyQ is a little bit delayed, I think one of the things that's interesting is that your non-HyQ SubQ product has been doing a little bit better than we expected. Would you be able to quantify either from a share or dollar perspective what the run rate there is now?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, probably, I think too early to quantify. I mean, again as we commented previously, and I would reiterate today, James, we're very encouraged by the market response of our 10% SubQ. As you know that our SubQ is the lowest reported local site reaction of any of the SubQ products by far, and that's been really validated through use in the marketplace. Beyond that, quantitatively, Mary Kay, I don't if there's anything you want to share that might be helpful?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, I think we're off to a great start with SubQ. We continue to see patient gains both competitively, as well as conversions from IV to SubQ, James, and our assumptions currently include sales approaching -- on a global basis, because we do also have a product in Europe that we sell -- of about $100 million in 2012.","Robert L. Parkinson","And I appreciate your question. I mean, obviously, we'll talk more about this, I'm sure, with follow-on questions about the HyQ program, the delay and so forth. But your point is a good one because the reality is with a 10% SubQ, we got a great product. We've got something to promote, we're getting traction in the marketplace, and so growth in this segment is not exclusively dependent on the short term of the timing approval for HyQ. So that's an important point for everyone to understand.","Operator","Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank is on the line with a question.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I will follow up on just kind of any more specifics that you might have on HyQ. Maybe just helping us frame what your initial expectations are with the FDA's request and maybe some broad timelines, if you can.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, I don't know if we can define the timelines, Kristen. And there's still -- we're still engaged with a discussion with the FDA so I don't think we want to be premature. Maybe you'd want to -- I'll ask Dr. Riedel. Norbert, why don't you comment on this, if you could, so we can provide some help to Kristen.","Norbert G. Riedel","Maybe just as a follow-up to what we have announced at the beginning of the week and to just ground everyone, the study we have done in the administration of immunoglobulin therapies for HYLENEX or HyQ is a study where patients were treated immunoglobulins for more than 1 year. In the extension that we have ongoing, actually some patients are approaching 3 years, and we have not seen any serious or non-serious adverse events that would have actually given us any concerns in the clinical study. We have actually talked about the results as recently as last month, and we presented the longer-term studies. And the concerns of the agency are really around the long-term chronic use of the hyaluronidase that is part of this therapy and the administration of immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulin therapy, as you know from our indication in PID, is indicated for long-term chronic use. So the concerns that the agency has raised are around hyaluronidase in long-term chronic use. I can't really give you a lot of specifics or more specifics than what we have shared only because we are in dialogue with Halozyme and the FDA as to how to address the concern and what kinds of studies we would propose to address those concerns. But I will, of course, keep you posted on that, as soon as I have a clearer picture and better definition. But that's really all I can share with you at this point.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, your expectation is to go before a panel. Am I reading into it then, or should I read into it that, that seems, at least, to be positive and that I would imagine you would be able to give some of this data from the extended study. So I guess, how should we think about the panel just in terms of possibly helping maybe to support an approval?","Norbert G. Riedel","So the Blood Products Advisory Committee is the panel that you are referring to. It will actually be involved in looking at the proposed studies that we will put forward as to how to address the concerns of the agency. So I think you're right. I think that's a positive. And actually, it's also really a pretty normal course of action and a regular path, so there's nothing particularly unusual about it. And that's the ground plan, that we will actually have the panel and discuss the study design with the panel.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Actually, can I ask one other question just on the gross margin? Given the recombinant strength in the quarter, I was a little surprised that we didn't see a little bit more upside there. Can you maybe just walk through in any granular detail the moving parts there?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, what I would say is, first and foremost, Q1 is always the lowest quarter from a margin standpoint for us in most cases. So again, this was in line with our expectation. There were some positive mix benefits, as we mentioned. There are some headwinds built into 2012 that we've talked about quite a bit. As we mentioned, we remain very confident in the full year guidance of flat to very modestly down, which implies that the gross margin will increase in subsequent quarters. I'd also highlight that the one aspect of seasonality that's pretty consistent in our results is Q2 tends to be a higher margin quarter for us, primarily due to the fact that we have sales in Europe of our FSME vaccine, particularly encephalitis. And so that's a high-margin product that tends to augment the Q2 margins. So we're certainly expecting margin to improve as we move throughout the year with Q2, again, likely to be the highest of the quarters and again, very comfortable with the full year guidance.","Operator","David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could comment just on HyQ and the extent to which the FDA review, how that influences the international approval timelines and what the latest thinking was there.","Norbert G. Riedel","So as you know, we have actually submitted our dossier in Europe and in Canada as well, and it's under review there. And we are in dialogue with those agencies, but there's really nothing in particular or specific that I need to comment on or can comment on because it's an ongoing review process, and it's taking, likewise, its normal course of action at this point.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe a follow-up on the CapEx questions for Bob. The $1 billion, how should we think about that getting layered into the cash flow statement? Is that something that you're swapping on existing CapEx for that, or that's a true gross or net addition of $1 billion spread evenly over the next several years?","Robert J. Hombach","That will be -- that is incremental in the sense that -- we always invest in our plasma footprint, and as we've mentioned, we've got additional capacity coming online in Italy, as an example. So there's an existing base of expense of spending that's going on even today. Given the nature of bringing a new plant up, though, the spending tends to be a bit more front-loaded because you need to get the facility in place, the equipment in place, build a conformance lot, submit stability studies and all of those things. So I would say 2013 and 2014 are going to be the peak years. And from an incremental standpoint of where we're sitting today, I think about it in kind of $400 million of incremental spend in each of those years, with some flex between '13 and '14 to accommodate this additional spending. But what I would add is given our strong cash position, our strong cash flow that we expect to have going forward, our very strong balance sheet and flexibility within our current credit ratings, this additional investment is not going to constrain our ability to continue to do the things we've been doing, which is reinvesting in other parts of our business, turning significant value to shareholders in dividends and buyback, and doing select bolt-on acquisitions that augment our portfolio.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, maybe Bob Parkinson, you can provide just some context for the acceleration in R&D spending. I mean, this has been a pretty consistent theme at Baxter, certainly since you've been there. I think R&D spending is up over 50% since you joined the company. Maybe -- the HyQ disappointment on Monday, I think, does raise some questions just about the return profile of some of that R&D. Could you talk to us how we should think about the return on that investment and when we start to see a little bit more top and bottom line contribution from those investments that you've made?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, first of all, I don't think anyone should associate the disappointment and the delay in HyQ with the broader pipeline. In my prepared comments this morning, I cited just a few examples of many in terms of how we're progressing in all of our businesses on multiple fronts. I mean, the ramp-up in R&D since I've been here, as we've discussed many times, is a reflection of, at the end of the day, what's our most important strategic priority, which is the ability to innovate because that's really the only sustainable business model in this industry, in my view. And again, as I've commented a number of times, I try to be as objective about this as I can. I really believe our pipeline today is the strongest that it's been in the history of the company. The profile of what's in our pipeline are largely products that are higher margin than the overall company, clearly, that represent a better growth trajectory with primary focus on core franchises, hemophilia being one, renal and dialysis being another and then so forth. So in terms of the impact, obviously, we all know HyQ was the near-term opportunity to have some material effect on our sales growth. But I mean things that we've already got approved and launched from the 10% SubQ, we talked about the expanded label on ADVATE. Sometimes we don't typically associate this with R&D spend. But these are all programs that required R&D investment, and the highest payback and the most significant return are on those things that further enhance the position of franchises or businesses that are already established. There's just a couple of examples. We hope to get the approval on the MMN indication and so on. So I'll stop short of playing back the entire pipeline, but let's not associate the shorter-term disappointment on HyQ as a reflection of the broader pipeline because the strategic priority is as I described.","Operator","Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with a question.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, Bob, maybe I can just ask a question on HyQ, because I do want to focus on it, and I think there are probably 2 questions. I think the first question is what does Hylozyme have available in terms of its data set, both clinical and nonclinical, that you think could be a value to the FDA? That the FDA has not already seen? And second, this response by the FDA has certainly surprised the company. This is an issue we've discussed over the last couple of years, the FDA's comfort with the chronic usage of hyaluronidase. So why do you think this surprised the company, and what was missing in the back and forth with the FDA that had this come out last minute?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, I mean, look, the one thing we all know is it's difficult to speculate on the motivation or rationale of the FDA. I think it is fair to say that we were surprised, certainly disappointed. Norbert, I'm going to have you address the first part of Mike's question in terms of Hylozyme data, what do we have and so on, recognizing that we're limited to talk about it until we get further down the path in our dialogue with the agency.","Norbert G. Riedel","Right. So, Mike -- because we have talked about this before. You and I have talked about this before. I was very much focused on the actual clinical trial results that we saw in our first Phase III trial with in HYLENEX in PID. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we have seen a very clean efficacy and safety profile in that study, not only within the Phase III that was submitted to the agency, but also with respect to the extension that we have ongoing where patients have been on therapy for almost 3 years now. So clearly, I have and continue to have a high level of confidence that the clinical trial data is very strong data, and we published that and you referred to that in your write-up. With respect to the agency's concern, it's really about introducing the recombinant human pH 20 or hyaluronidase as a long-term chronic administration of a molecule, and questions or concerns around that. We are truly working with Hylozyme on a daily basis to identify what data exists and what data the agency is looking for and how to best design studies around those data. At this point, that's really all I can tell you. And as soon as we have that better defined, we will of course communicate that. That's the current status.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bob, does the potential pushout of Hylozyme, and I'm not talking about 6 months, but -- of HyQ, the pushout maybe beyond 6 months, making this a longer pushout. Does that potential change your thinking at all on M&A in terms of appetite, not only for the -- you've talked about wanting to do a series of smaller deals but potentially doing anything larger?","Robert L. Parkinson","No, it doesn't. Our priorities in terms of M&A are consistent with what we've -- I don't see any correlation between the 2 at all. Just a straight out answer to it.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I understood that. I think the question from the street would be if the targets you have internally for re-accelerating revenue growth, and a lot of that's going to be driven by the pipeline. If those targets get pushed out, does that -- would that lead you to pursue M&A more aggressively or sooner than you would have, otherwise? That's the thinking behind it.","Robert L. Parkinson","I don't think so. I think our outlook -- and obviously, we look forward to get together with everybody at the investor conference in October to talk about this. I mean, let's just back up and put this in perspective. We're disappointed in the delay of HyQ. Only a handful of analysts, I think yourself included, Mike, had even quantified what the long-term impact was or longer-term impact. I think the average incremental revenue associated with this in 2014 -- so in other words, 2 years post the launch, it was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million. I don't want to minimize that. That's not insignificant. But in the context of a company of our size, particularly -- just to be very candid with you in view of the reaction of the market this week, is a total disconnect, okay? The other point I would make is assuming this represents just a delay -- as you all know, because we talk about capacity, fractionation capacity all the time, the incremental value of HyQ is more price-related than it was volume-related, because to be very candid, with the 10% SubQ, which I commented, robust market growth, opportunities globally, we can sell as much IVIG as we can make, independent of whether we have HyQ approved or not. So again, I don't want to minimize the incremental value primarily associated with the\tprice. But if the composite or consensus average of incremental sales 2 years out was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million, that puts it in a quantitative perspective vis-\u00e0-vis the reaction to the market this week. So you know what? I'll just leave it at that.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think that was perfect. Let me ask you just a couple other pipeline follow-ups. One, can you just talk about ADVATE approval in China? Is that coming as well as from other emerging markets I know you're waiting on? And second, where are you on timeline for filing your recombinant Factor IX product?","Robert L. Parkinson","Okay. Well, the ADVATE -- Mary Kay, help me. I mean, Russia and China are still on track this year.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, still on track. On track, Mike, second half of this year, no change at this point to our expectations for both China and Russia. And in regards to the recombinant Factor IX, we are looking -- that's also on track to be completed here and filed in the second half as well.","Operator","Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just -- not to beat a dead horse here on your points you just made, Bob, on HyQ, but just -- I want to be clear about one thing, and I think you talked about this in the past. Let's say hypothetically, it was going to be a $100 million or $200 million product in 2 years. Is it also fair to say that your thinking was you get into the SubQ market with SubQ, and then you add to that, drive mix, drive some incremental share possibly, but to some degree, penetrate your SubQ business over time with HyQ?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. And clearly, that was the original strategy, and it still is based on the timing of approval of HyQ. I think the difference is, originally, when we launched the 10% SubQ, we saw it as a catch-up to be then competitive with other SubQs on the market, okay? In other words, a catch-up launch to set the stage for HyQ. What we've learned, as I commented, we have the superior SubQ product right now, which has a lot more traction and opportunity than what we had earlier anticipated. So the strategy remains the same to over time upgrade to HyQ when and if we get approval for HyQ. But in the meantime, we have more upside and opportunity on 10% than what we had estimated at the start, if that makes sense to you.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It does. And so there I'd look at that $100 million to $200 million number and I'd, say, \"Well, part of that was sort of an overlay on the existing business at that time.\" So, yes, I would agree with your earlier comments, and those are very helpful. One just point, if I could, on what the FDA has said or focused on in terms of the chronic use. You mentioned, I think, clearly, that there's no safety concerns for IVIG, which is used chronically and widely. Was there any observations or any blip in the data that the FDA had seen or focused on for hyaluronidase? Or is this a matter of routine that they've just decided to be more careful?","Robert L. Parkinson","Norbert? So I'm going to ask Norbert to comment on this.","Norbert G. Riedel","Maybe, I'll just expand on it just in the following way. There was nothing in particular. I think it has to do with, and in a reasonable way, has to do with the recombinant hyaluronidase being positioned for chronic long-term use for which it is currently is not indicated. And I think the questions and concerns are all around that aspect of this therapy. And keep in mind, maybe as a follow-up to the earlier questions, while our SubQ is positioning us extremely well in the space of this cloud of administration, we have always looked at the HyQ as truly a transformational, game-changing incremental improvement, much beyond what SubQ does. And so it's one of those pioneering programs in our pipeline that we think are highly promising, but also in a way, go down a new path with the regulators. And therefore, there's a little bit more uncertainty than there would be in a Factor IX or a Factor VII or a von Willebrand Factor, which is a more straightforward -- maybe a life cycle management product development approach versus pioneering new ground. And that also speaks to the pipeline being really balanced between life cycle management opportunities that are truly enhancing existing core businesses and new opportunities like HyQ, like stem cells, for which I think we need to make resources available. Because that is our legacy of truly premium first-to-market innovations to our patients and customers. If I was to draw conclusions from HyQ in general onto the pipeline and the productivity of the pipeline, I think we'll be [indiscernible] in this place.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then one, if I could, just on -- Bob your comments on -- I think holding share obtained from Octa last year was sort of the math that you were doing with the $30 million benefit that you saw in the first quarter of '11. When does that -- you'd sort of given -- if I recall correctly, your guidance assumes that you'd surrender something like $100 million of gained share last year back to Octapharma as they got into the market. It doesn't seem like that's happening yet, or it -- from the numbers you're reporting, I guess, when does that turn into potentially edging up some of the expectations for the year?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, a couple of things. As we pointed out in our prepared comments, we are going to have a tough comp in the second quarter, but we will see stronger growth in the third or fourth quarter. But as we also mentioned, because of shutting down the old facility, extending its useful life and providing important flexibility going forward, we are going to be constrained this year. We have shifted product to meet market needs. And so I didn't want to imply here that the specific customer-by-customer retention of share from Octa because different price points, different geographies where they're stronger and so on. But in aggregate, stepping back and looking at the level of demand we're seeing for our product, again, augmented here with a strong uptick for SubQ in the -- 10% SubQ in the SubQ market, we feel very good about how our share position overall has evolved. And we have not competed to try to retain some of those more price-sensitive customers that we've talked about before that are likely targets for Octa's reentry.","Operator","Rajeev Jashnani of UBS is on the line with a question.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just on the recombinants business, there's obviously a robust result there in the U.S. And I was just wondering if you could help us understand what we could expect there, maybe in the U.S. and x-U.S. across the remainder of the year. One quarter obviously was very strong, but can we expect the same kind of growth across the balance of the year and maybe x-U.S. declines widening? Or if you could throw out any other color there?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I mean, recall that we're in the process of the Australian tender playing out, so we're going to have tough comps throughout the course of this year on the international front related to the Australian tender, which is going to murk up the picture here as we go forward. Again, we're very encouraged by first quarter results in the U.S. and the reaction from both treaters and patients to the very strong data from the ADVATE label expansion and prophy indication for adults and so on. But again, it's early days. So I would say we expect to be in good position to grow, at least with the market here in the U.S. throughout the course of this year. But again, we're going to have tough comps internationally, and that's reflected in our global guidance for the full year.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I had one follow-up on the IVIG market. I think there was a pretty healthy increase reported in the CMS database for pricing for the fourth quarter, and I was just wondering if you could comment whether you saw that sustained over the first quarter.","Robert J. Hombach","No. We've got to be careful here because, as you know, there's a number of dynamics that come into play with CMS reporting. We've talked about the fact, in terms of the contracting process here for 2012 with our customers in the U.S., we had a very modest price increase, certainly well below 6%. And so that has to do with timing and how we report certain adjustments and rebates and following their rules and so on. So I would not attribute much value to that 6% because that is not what we're seeing.","Robert L. Parkinson","Mary Kay, would you follow on to the other -- first part of the question?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, I just was going to add, Rajeev, that in recombinants, as Bob mentioned, we didn't change our full year guidance at this point. The Australian impact is about $60 million for the full year, and that will pay out over the course of the year. We'll have a little bit easier comps outside the U.S. as we get into the back half of the year. But just an example of the impact Australia has had, international sales were flat in the quarter, including the impact of Australia. And x that, they were up 6%, in line generally with the market upgrowth that we're seeing and estimating.","Operator","Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So first on HyQ. I assume the FDA has seen the data approaching 3 years that you mentioned in your comments earlier?","Norbert G. Riedel","No. The answer is no. We have not yet submitted the data on the extension study to the FDA.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And how many patients are out beyond 1 year at this point? How many patients do you have that are out to that 3-year mark or close...","Norbert G. Riedel","Just a few more than 50 patients that continue in the extension study, and recall the Phase III study itself was just shy of 90 patients. I think it was 87 -- no, 56, I believe, are continuing in the extension study.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the data -- obviously, we they've seen the 1-year data on all patients, so you're going, at some point, present to them the incremental data here. I'm just trying to frame the timing. I know there's not much you can say on this, but listening to the conversation, you're talking about you're designing new studies and questions about chronic use. It would seem to me that we should really be thinking about this in terms of an 18-month delay. I mean, from your -- at least. I mean, from your perspective, is there a better scenario here that's possible from a timing perspective? Or is the 18 months that I'm using as a placeholder probably not a bad way of thinking about it at this point?","Norbert G. Riedel","Well, truly, I don't know what actually leads you to the 18 months that you are using. I can only tell you that at this stage, I really can't put a 3-year time frame around it, because that will depend on not only the design of the studies, but also the discussion with the FDA and with the advisory committee. So it's truly too early. But I do believe that we will be pushed out beyond 2012. As I get closer to understanding what exactly needs to be done, then I can help you with the timeline. But at this point, I would be speculating and I'd rather not do that.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on plasma capacity. Your guidance for this year is for basically low- to mid-single-digit growth in those businesses. At what point do your capacity constraints ease? And one way to ask the question is, if we look out beyond 2012, if the demand were there, could you grow those plasma businesses more in that 6% to 8% type of area as we think about 2013? Again, if the demand were there? So I'm just trying to get a sense as when you think these capacity constraints will ease? And is about high-single digits possible beyond 2012 if the demand warrants it?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, yes. This is what I tried to comment on at the outset is with keeping up old L.A. in commission and some of the other expansion initiatives we have, we believe our installed capacity can support growth over the next few years, let's say, in the 6% to 8% range, Bob?","Mary Kay Ladone","That's volume growth.","Robert L. Parkinson","That's volume growth, yes.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So when specifically do the capacity constraints start to ease? Is that really not until the kind of beginning of 2013?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I would say kind of towards the middle of 2013, because as we've talked about, we're taking old L.A. down for 5 months towards the end of this year. But with the plasma production cycles that you're familiar with of up to 6 months, it's going to take into the second quarter before we've got it back up running and go through the process and have sellable product. So I would put it as kind of middle of next year before that's online. But as we also have mentioned, we're bringing additional capacity on to the back half of this year in our Rieti, Italy facility. We are ramping up production this year and continuing to ramp up the utilization level in new L.A. We'll take another step-up in early 2013 as well, so that will alleviate some of the pressure here. But I think really to be in the most robust situation, it's middle of 2013.","Robert L. Parkinson","But the 6% to 8% over the next few years is reasonable, and that's IGs really.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, that's IVIG.","Robert L. Parkinson","And albumin would have.","Robert J. Hombach","And other. We'd be in better shape.","Robert L. Parkinson","We'd be in better shape with albumin, okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of things, and I apologize. I jumped on a little bit late. Did you review any update on the home hemo product timing, and when you're expecting to get that product launched and going?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. Actually, we did not, Rick, so it's a timely question. So Norbert and Mary Kay, you want to give the specifics?","Norbert G. Riedel","So the study is actually ongoing, the clinical study, and I would characterize it as patients on therapy really liking the therapy. So since we restarted, we have had no further issues to deal with, and therefore our projected timeline remains for a CE marking in Europe in 2013 and for U.S. launch in 2014 -- a U.S. filing in 2014, I'm sorry.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So filing -- U.S. filing in 2014?","Norbert G. Riedel","Correct.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And that would take another -- if some of the things went normally, that might take another year. So it's 2015 if all goes well for a launch theoretically?","Norbert G. Riedel","It shouldn't take that long because we've -- but I'd rather not speculate on it. So let's stay with filing and then see what happens thereafter.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, and, Rick, as we've mentioned in the past, I mean, we're as excited about the opportunities for home HD outside the U.S. as we are inside. And while we would love to have an approval in the U.S. as soon as possible, we certainly can make a lot of headway on this program by getting a CE mark and moving forward in those markets where today, we have a well-established PD business. There is a well-accepted approach to home treatment for dialysis in Europe and reimbursement rates are attractive.","Robert L. Parkinson","And we still have 80% of our renal businesses outside -- PD business outside of the U.S. So sometimes people lose sight of that. So that's really the big opportunity in the short term, Rick.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Right. Just 2 more questions, and I'll let you pick and choose if you've discussed it before. Just an update on the integration of med delivery in renal. It sounds like we're pretty much done and so, Bob, I'd be curious to -- Bob Hombach, I'd be curious to hear if there's further cost cutting beyond that? And last, Norbert, any update on the Alzheimer's program and Phase III data, next reported milestones, anything would be appreciated.","Robert J. Hombach","Okay. So on the Medical Products integration front, the way we characterized it up to this point, this was a $75 million to $100 million cost opportunity for us over time. We're probably 2\/3 or more down the track of realizing that. But there still are additional leverage opportunities in front of us over the next couple of years, but the lion's share of it we have already baked into our expectations.","Norbert G. Riedel","And, Rick, on Alzheimer's, the first Phase III trial, as you know, will complete with the last patient out at the end of this year. We still expect to have the data analyzed and available in the first half of 2013. The second trial, which we initiated after the futility analysis turned out to be positive, has begun to enroll patients. Sites have been initiated, so we are off to a good start on the second Phase III trial.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And data presentations interim, anything coming up the next 6 to 12 months, Norbert?","Norbert G. Riedel","No. I don't think so.","Operator","Your last question comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. On the new facility for plasma, is it going to be similar to L.A., because I'm just wondering why you might not want to try to tweak it a bit and see if you can get a little bit more yield out of IG?","Robert L. Parkinson","Actually the layout, Matt, we're going to take a little different approach, more of a modular approach than we took in L.A. I think that does several things for us. One is to, I think, relative to the yield question you asked, perhaps do a better job in terms of yield. It also allows us to scale up beyond the 3-million-liter incremental capacity that we cited this morning in a quicker fashion if we choose to do that. So the approach is actually quite different than what we took in L.A.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then one final question on renal. Internationally, it grew, I think, about 1%, and it looked like it was off a pretty easy comp. Is there anything unique that happened that quarter? Or was it PD, HD? Anything you can give me color on that?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, Matt, it's Mary Kay. We did talk about this when we gave our guidance back in January, that we did expect that given the Yako [ph] reimbursement. That's a biannual, every 2 year, basically price reduction in Japan, as well as we are seeing some of the EU austerity measures that we discussed, which has, for the full year, a $30 million to $40 million impact over the total portfolio. But there is a significant portion that's in renal as well. So that will be an ongoing difficult comparison that we'll have going forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

As a reminder this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter\u2019s permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","","Thanks Pam. Good morning everyone and welcome to our Q3, 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Ludwig Hantson, President, BioScience; and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for more detailed concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today\u2019s call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter\u2019s ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Thanks Mary Kay. Good morning and thank you all for calling in. As you saw in this morning\u2019s press release Baxter reported strong financial results for the third quarter, which exceeded expectations. Relative to our guidance which included vaccines adjusted earnings increased 9% to $1.35 per diluted share and worldwide sales advanced 13%. Excluding foreign currency and Gambro, from both periods, global sales increase 6%. I am very pleased with overall organic sales performance from ongoing operations as the third quarter represents the highest quarterly growth of this year. This affords us the opportunity to increase investments and research and development and further enhance manufacturing and quality and operational excellence as we position our company for sustained success.","In recent months we\u2019ve continued to make progress in strengthening the portfolio with new collaborations advancing the new product pipeline through the achievement of meaningful milestones and the organization remains engaged in working to separate Baxter into two leading global healthcare companies aimed at enhancing shareholder value over the long term. For example within BioScience we are building on the strategic decision to expand our presence in the area of oncology, leveraging the company\u2019s heritage of success in developing new therapies that treat unmet medical needs for patients with rare diseases. ","Not only has living Ludwig been building an experienced team of oncology leaders including senior clinical development, business development and proven commercial executives but we also continue to see partnership opportunities to expand the pipeline. ","You may recall that last month we signed an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals for the development and commercialization of MM-398, an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, previously treated with the gemcitabine-based therapy. As you know pancreatic cancer is a rare and deadly disease that\u2019s difficult to diagnose and has limited treatment options. ","Through this agreement BioScience gains exclusive commercialization rights for all potential indications of MM-398 outside the United States and Taiwan. MM-398 has demonstrated robust survival results in a global Phase 3 trial that will be the basis for regulatory submissions outside the U.S. beginning in 2015. BioScience now has four oncology assets; MM-398, [inaudible] and BAX-069 with the potential for numerous indications for patients with hematologic and solid malignancies. ","We look forward to discussing the progress of the oncology portfolio and advancement of the pipeline in the future. The bioscience organization also continues to enhance its focus on specific disease areas, centered on core areas of expertise in hematology, immunology and through technology platforms like gene therapy and biosimilars. It's for this reason that we elected to divest the commercial vaccines business, including the NeisVac-C and FSME vaccines and during the third quarter announced a definitive agreement with Pfizer. We're working to close this transaction in the fourth quarter and continue to explore strategic options, including the potential for partnering or divesting the R&D development programs focused on influenza and line disease.","In addition we've also achieved an array of significant pipeline milestones including the FDA approval of HYQVIA is the first subcutaneous immune globulant, a transformational subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with primary immunodeficiency. HYQVIA is the first subcutaneous immune globulant treatment approved with the dosing regimen requiring only one infusion per month and one injection site per fusion to deliver it full therapeutic dose while maintaining the same efficacy safety and tolerability profile in its currently marketed products. ","Today many patients received IV infusions in a doctor\u2019s office or infusion center and current subcutaneous treatments require weekly or bi-weekly treatment with multiple infusion sites per treatment. We expect to launch HYQVIA in the United States next week and are evaluating regulatory requirements and initiation of additional clinical trials for new indications. As a reminder the global market for primary immunodeficiency is approximately $2 billion and only approximately 35% of patients are treated subcutaneously, providing a unique opportunity for HYQVIA as a differentiated therapy. ","In addition in August Baxter released positive top line results from the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of BAX-855, an extended half-life recombinant Factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. BAX-855 met its primary endpoint in the control and prevention of bleeding, routine prophylaxis and peri-operative management for patients who are 12 years or older with patients in a twice weekly prophylaxis arm experiencing a 95% reduction in median annualized bleeding rates as compared to those in the on-demand arm. In addition BAX-855 was also affected in treating bleeding episodes 96% of which were controlled with one or two infusions and approximately 40% of patients were bleed-free. ","No patients developed inhibitors to BAX-855 and no treatment related serious adverse events including hypersensitivity were reported. Our continuation and pediatric studies are progressing and we're planning to submit a biologics license application to the FDA before the end of 2014. ","Also during the quarter Baxter received FDA approval of RIXUBIS for routine prophylactic treatment controlled and prevention of bleeding episodes and peri-operative management in children with hemophilia B. We launched RIXUBIS in the U.S. late last year for the adult population and are very pleased with its market acceptance. Our application for adults and pediatric patients is currently under review in the European Union and we expect a regulatory decision later this year. ","Within the medical products business recent highlights include an exclusive agreement with Rockwell Medical to commercialize their leading hemodialysis concentrate product line in the United States and in select overseas markets. Hemodialysis concentrates help to clean a patient's blood and remove waste and extra fluid from the body. This agreement enhances Baxter's comprehensive range of therapeutic options across home, in center and hospital settings for patients with end stage renal disease. ","And finally we recently announced the expansion plans at our state of the art manufacturing facility in OPELIKA, Alabama to help address the growing global demand for dialyzers. Baxter will invest nearly $300 million in the OPELIKA site and we expect to begin commercial production in 2016 augmenting several other recent capacity expansions for dialyzers across our footprint.","In addition to delivering solid financial results and accelerating innovation the organization is fully engaged in the process of separating Baxter into two leading global healthcare companies; one, focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life-saving medical products.","During the quarter, as you know we formally unveiled Baxalta Incorporated as the name of the new publically traded biopharmaceutical company. The name Baxalta celebrates and sustains our heritages as an innovator and legacy of leadership by incorporating the Baxter name and coupling it with Alta which derives from opus which is Latin for high or profound. ","Upon completion of the separation Baxalta Inc. will trade at the New York stock exchange under the symbol BXLP and Baxter International will continue trading on the New York stock exchange under the symbol BAX. While the corporate headquarters of both companies will be located in Northern Illinois, we recently announced that Baxalta is forming a new global innovation and research and development center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This will position the new company to optimize R&D productivity, accelerate innovation by building on its robust pipeline in core areas of expertise, strengthen and increase R&D collaborations with partners in new and emerging biotech areas and enhanced patient care globally.","As many of you know we\u2019ve now named our senior leadership teams for both companies and have established the international and commercial structures for both organizations. We have elevated several senior leaders into new roles and have complemented our strong commercial and operational teams with some new talent including experienced professionals from leading biotech pharmaceutical and medical device companies.","Many of you have also asked about appointments within Investor Relations and today I am pleased to announce that Mary Kay Ladone after a 26 year career at Baxter will become Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations for Baxalta upon completion of the spin. In the interim Mary Kay will continue in her current role and will be responsible for the ongoing Investor Relations efforts at Baxter.","In conjunction with Mary Kay\u2019s appointment I am pleased to announce that Scott Bohaboy, a senior level Finance Executive with eight years of experience at our company will become Baxter\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. During his tenure Scott has held several senior financial roles with Baxter including in corporate planning, the U.S. hospital business, our Asia Pacific region and he currently serves as Vice President, Finance for our international operations. Scott also has previous experience in Investor Relations at two other companies earlier in his career. ","In addition Clare Trachtman, who many of you already know will be named Vice President Investor Relations for Baxter and will report directly to Scott. Both Scott and Clare will continue in their current roles for the near future and will work closely with Mary Kay and her IR team as we transition into two separate companies in mid-2015.","In closing, Baxter has an established history of executing successful spin-offs and we believe this separation provides two unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders. Our decision underscores our commitment to ensuring our long-term strategic priorities remain aligned with shareholders\u2019 best interest while we seek to improve our competitive position and performance, enhance operational commercial and scientific effectiveness and create long-term value for patients\u2019, heathcare providers\u2019 and other key stakeholders.","As always I\u2019d be happy to address any questions you may have with regards to the spin-off or other topics during the Q&A and so with that I\u2019ll now turn call over to Bob Hombach. Bob please.","Robert J. Hombach","","Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter advanced 9% to $1.35, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.28 to $1.32 per share. This performance reflects strong sales growth as well as continued investments in research and development, unplanned gains from equity investments totaling $0.03 per diluted share which will be reinvested in the business and adjusted income from discontinued operations of $26 million or $0.04 per diluted share.","As we mentioned in the press release GAAP earnings of $0.86 per diluted share, includes income from discontinued operations of $21 million, or $0.04 per diluted share and after-tax special items totaling $273 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, primarily for intangible amortization and costs associated with upfront product development and milestone payments, integration of the company\u2019s acquisition of Gambro AB and Baxter\u2019s planned separation.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2014. Please note that with a few exceptions for purposes of today\u2019s discussion I will focus my comments on the adjusted P&L line items as seen on page 10 of the press release which shows the reconciliation of adjusted and GAAP earnings and reflects the Vaccine franchise as a discontinued operation. For reference we disclosed historical financial information for the vaccines franchise last week and have also posted the schedules to the Investor Relations page of Baxter\u2019s website.","Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4.2 billion advanced 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding Gambro from both periods Baxter sales rose 5% on a reported basis or 6% on a constant currency basis reflecting an acceleration of organic growth versus the first half of the year. You may recall that our sales guidance for the quarter included vaccine revenues, which were expected to decline given the receipt of lower milestone payments versus last year. When including vaccine revenues Baxter global sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis which is at the high end of our previously issued guidance range.","Sales in the U.S. increased 7% and international sales excluding Gambro and foreign currency also increased 7%. Sales from emerging markets, which now represent almost 25% of total Baxter sales, advanced nearly 20% given very strong performance in the BRIC markets driven by the timing of tenders.","In terms of individual business performance global BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.7 billion and advanced 8% on both a reported and constant currency basis. And despite a difficult comparison the U.S. bio therapeutics franchise BioScience reported the highest quarterly growth in almost two years.","Within the product categories hemophilia sales of $942 million increased 11% on both reported and constant currency basis. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit ADVATE growth which continues to be driven by strong global demand as well as benefits from recent tender wins in the UK and Australia and conversion to recombinant therapy in Brazil where to-date we have converted approximately 40% of the estimated 10,000 hemophilia A patients and continue to expect to generate sales of more than $100 million in 2014.","In the U.S. ADVATE growth was high single-digits supported by continued conversion to prophylactic treatment and very minimal loss of share to a new competitive entrant. We are also benefiting from the launch of new products and indications. RIXUBIS, our treatment for hemophilia B patients was launched in the U.S. late last year and we continue to be pleased with its uptake.","Our hemophilia performance also reflects robust demand and double-digit growth in FEIBA for the treatment of hemophilia patients with inhibitors. As you may recall only 15% to 20% of inhibitor patients globally are treated prophylactically and with approvals of this new indication across multiple large geographies like the U.S., Canada, Australia and Japan. We expect this to represent a significant growth opportunity for our hemophilia franchise over the long-term.","In biotherapeutics sales of $546 million improved sequentially due to enhanced product availability and we continue to see robust demand and stable market growth for our immunoglobulin and albumin therapies globally. Sales growth for this product category was 3% in the quarter on a reported basis and grew 4% on a constant currency basis. As mentioned on our last earnings call we expected an acceleration in international growth this quarter as we are building on our position in many foothold markets. And we also expect the growth in the U.S. to moderate due to tough comparisons created by supply availability and the easing of constraints beginning in the third quarter last year.","In addition we are being prudent in managing our global supply and inventory levels as we prepare for the upcoming HYQVIA launch which is expected next week. And given the renewal of albumin licenses in China we are once again optimizing our geographic mix with albumin shipments into that large and growing market.","In BioSurgery sales totaled $185 million and increased 7%. On a constant currency basis sales rose 6% driven by increased penetration for surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL. In medical products global sales of more than $2.5 billion increased 17% on a reported basis and were up 18% on a constant currency basis. Excluding Gambro medical product sales grew 4% on both reported and constant currency basis.","Within the product categories renal sales were approximately $1.1 billion which includes a contribution from Gambro of $391 million. Recall that we closed the Gambro acquisition in September last year and recorded sales of $100 million. Excluding Gambro from both periods renal sales of $664 million increased 3% or 4% on a constant currency basis. Strong global PD growth of 7% was somewhat offset by the impact of the CRRT divestiture.","As mentioned last quarter PD patient gains remain strong particularly in the U.S. where PD sales increased 12% for the quarter and the 13% year-to-date. Given this very strong demand we are experiencing back orders and are expediting shipments as we remain committed to ensuring patients have interrupted access to their therapy. We continue to produce PD solutions at maximum capacity, are working to expand capacity to meet the growing demand and are beginning to source product from our facility in Castlebar, Ireland through the much appreciated support of the FDA which granted a temporary import license. ","Going forward we will continue to work with customers to carefully manage inventory and maintain continuity of care for our patients. We are very appreciative of the close collaboration and great support we received from the agency in this regard. Going forward we will continue to work with customers to carefully manage inventory and maintain continuity of care. ","Within the fluid systems category sales of $827 million increased 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. Performance is driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV therapies. As you may know to date we have not experienced any new competition for cyclophosphamide and we're updating our guidance for this new assumption. For your reference sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide in the third quarter were approximately $120 million and were lower than the prior year and sales on a year-to-date basis now total $345 million. ","Specialty pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies posted sales of $386 million reflecting an increase of 4%. Sales rose 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by mid-single digit growth of our anesthesia portfolio where we are increasing international penetration and low single digit growth for nutritional therapies. Finally sales in bio pharma solutions which is our pharma partnering business totaled $256 million and increased 5% on reported basis or 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily to strong pharmacy compounding revenues.","Turning to the rest of the P&L gross margin in the quarter was 50.5% compared to 52.7% last year. Positive mix from franchises within bioscience was primarily offset by the impact of foreign exchange and Gambro which collectively reduced the rate by approximately 130 basis points. In addition the gross margin was impacted by product mix within medical products, expedited freight for PD solutions and lower than expected production volumes as we continue to make investments to enhance our quality systems, processes and operational excellence to meet evolving regulatory requirements. ","SG&A totaled $921 million, and increased 13% with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the growth. Excluding Gambro SG&A increased 2% as leverage was derived from benefits associated with our business optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by select investments in promotional and marketing initiatives for new product launches in bioscience and incremental customer freight and logistical expenses to support the strong demand for IV solutions. ","R&D spending in the quarter of $292 million increased 16% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro R&D rose 8% driven by the addition of new R&D programs in bioscience through acquisitions, the acceleration of other programs in the areas of hematology, oncology and immunology and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the continuum of care. The operating margin in the quarter of 21.6% is lower than last year's operating margin of 23.8%. Excluding Gambro the operating margin was 23.4% reflecting the impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments referenced earlier. ","Interest expense was $31 million in the third quarter compared to $45 million last year. As expected we benefited from debt maturities and a favorable change related to the mix of floating versus fixed interest rates. Other income totaled $39 million and was driven primarily by the favorable foreign exchange impact on balance sheet positions and approximately $20 million or $0.03 per diluted share in unplanned equity gains related to investments in the Baxter Ventures fund. ","The tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations and as previously mentioned adjusted earnings per diluted share advanced 9% to $1.35. Turning to cash flow on a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $2.1 billion. DSO ended the quarter at 55.9 days and excluding Gambro Baxter's DSO was 53 days lower than the prior year by more than two days. ","Inventory turns of 2.2 are modestly higher than the prior period and lastly to-date we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for $500 million on a net basis, 1.5 million shares for $200 million.","Finally let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our updated financial outlook. For the full year we expect adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $4.86 to $4.89 per diluted share. After adding the expected earnings contribution from the vaccine franchise of approximately $0.27 per diluted share this guidance is in line with our previously issued and disclosed range of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share.","In addition we have updated our assumptions for cyclophosphamide and do not expect any new competition before the end of the year. While this has resulted in a transitory benefit it is offsetting incremental headwinds associated with foreign currency in the fourth quarter of approximately $0.04 per diluted share and other investments to enhance quality and operational effectiveness in the medical products business and additional investments in SG&A and R&D in BioScience.","Specifically by line item of the P&L and starting with sales, we now expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 11% to 12%, which includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At current foreign exchange rates we expect reported sales growth of approximately 10% to 11%. Excluding Gambro we expect Baxter\u2019s organic sales to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. For the full year we continue to expect gross margins for the company of approximately 50.5%. This compares to the prior year gross margin of 51.7%. In terms of expenses we now expect R&D and SG&A to grow in low to mid-teens for the full year.","We expect interest expense to total approximately $150 million and other income to total approximately $90 million for the full year. We expect the tax rate of approximately 22%, slightly higher than our original expectations as the vaccine franchise carry a very low tax rate and we expect a full year average share count of approximately 547 million shares which assumes approximately 300 million in net share repurchases. From a cash flow perspective we continue expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5 billion which excludes the cash cost associated with the spin-off of the biopharmaceuticals business. We now expect capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion which excludes pre-spin capital expenditures primarily in the area of information technologies. ","Let me move to sales and expand on our assumptions for the two businesses in the major product categories. Beginning with medical products on a constant currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro we now expect sales growth of approximately 15% and excluding Gambro we expect sales for medical products to grow approximately 3%.","Specifically we continue to expect renal sales to grow approximately 40%, we now expect Fluid Systems sales to grow approximately 4%, as we assume no material impact from cyclophosphamide competition this year. We continue to expect specialty pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics to grow in the 3% to 5% range and we expect our biopharma solution sales to be flat for the full year.","For BioScience we are once again raising our guidance and now project sales growth, excluding foreign currency of approximately 6%. Our outlook includes strong growth in our global hemophilia franchise of approximately 8% fueled by underlying global demand for ADVATE, conversion to recombinant therapy in Brazil, new tender wins and continued benefits from new product launches including RIXUBIS and fiber prophylaxis.","For the biotherapeutics franchise we continue to expect growth of approximately 4% driven by increased demand and the contribution from the HYQVIA launch. And finally for our BioSurgery business we continue to expect growth in low to mid-single digits. As mentioned in our press release for the fourth quarter we expect earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding special items of $1.30 to $1.33, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 3% and we expect reported sales to be flat to the prior year.","Before I open up the call for Q&A let me take a moment to update you on some of the financial aspects of the spin. First we expect to file our initial Form 10 for Baxalta before the end of this year, which will include historical financial results on a GAAP basis for the years 2010 through 2013 and year-to-date results for 2014. These financial statements will be prepared as if on a standalone basis and derive from Baxter\u2019s consolidated financials and will include allocations of various costs previously held at Baxter corporate level.","I would highlight that these financial statements are inherently limited as costs associated with corporate overhead, income taxes, support services and interest expenses may not be indicative of future costs associated with running Baxalta as an independent standalone corporation. We expect to file amendments to the Form-10 in 2015 results which will include 2014 and year-to-date 2015 financial results for Baxalta, in addition, to pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of expected debt and interest expense and other associated agreements and transactions.","As we previously disclosed we are in the process of designing the two new organizations and at this point our rough estimate of initial dis-synergies including [stranded] cost is approximately 2% of total Baxter sales or more than $300 million. About half of these costs will be incurred beginning in the second-half of 2015 and both companies will have the opportunity to reduce a meaningful portion of these costs over the next several years post spin.","In addition, spin related costs incurred in the first-half of 2015 will be considered special items and will be excluded from our adjusted earnings. Also, as we continue to work through the details of our IT ownership and manufacturing footprint we have not uncovered any substantial issues from a tax perspective. While we will finalizing the capital allocation strategies of each of the businesses in the coming months we expect that both will have strong balance sheet, generate significant cash flow and have the flexibility to follow a disciplined capital allocation approach which balances reinvestment of business in CapEx, R&D and M&A with returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. ","We look forward to sharing more information with you as we get closer to completing the spin. While we continue to work through the complexity this process is unfolding in line with our expectations and we continue on track toward a mid-2015 completion. This assumes the Form-10 registration statement is declared effective by the SEC and final approvals have been obtained including from our Board of Directors.","As we proceed towards the separation date we plan to host an investor conference in the second quarter of 2015 to introduce you to the new senior management teams and provide investors with more information regarding the strategies, growth prospects and financial outlooks for each company. We recognize that investors and analysts would like more information to help them model both companies separately and the intent of the conference is to help you establish a base line as each company will have a different financial profile after the separation. We will also engage in a comprehensive Investor Relations effort, including investor road shows for both companies with the respective senior management teams several weeks before the spin-off is completed.","Thanks. And now I\u2019d like to open-up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International\u2019s website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","I want to start with the hemophilia franchise and just taking a step back for a second, at the last time you provided your long range plan, I think you had talked about hemophilia as a 3 to 4% grower and you have caveated in there the potential for new competition which we are now starting to see. Can you maybe just help us put into context the year-to-date growth that you have seen and the 8% guidance that you provided, how much of that is a reflection of some benefits you are seeing this year versus the potential to see a substantially higher growth rate in that franchise than what you had initially targeted?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","","Well I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and then maybe I\u2019ll turn over to Ludwig to give you some more perspective on the dynamics we see in the hemophilia market. You know the guidance we gave several years ago, what was over a five year period and 3% to 4% growth clearly pre-competition we expected to grow faster than that and then with the impact of competition it would moderate over the timeframe. You know clearly we have had a very strong 2014 to-date and given how things have played as we\u2019ve discussed previously the overall competitive landscape has played out largely as we expected, if not slightly better in terms of what others have been able to achieve with on label indication for an enhanced extended half-life product and so I think going forward we have the opportunity to certainly achieve that if not potentially exceed that long-term guidance, but maybe I will turn over to Ludwig to add some color here on market dynamics.","Ludwig N. Hantson","","Yes, thanks for the question, David. So at this moment we are not changing our five year sales CAGR of 3% to 4% but as Bob was saying there is a probability for us to go beyond these numbers. The numbers that I gave you or that we gave you couple of years ago clearly were probabilized for R&D milestones. As we are hitting our R&D milestones it means that the likelihood that we are going to over achieve those numbers it\u2019s greater and we do expect that in addition to ADVATE and continuous fiber growth and continued growth in emerging growth countries that our new product launches such as RIXUBIS, [inaudible, 855, recombinant [inaudible] will have an impact here on the five year plan.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And maybe just to follow-up on the emerging markets more broadly, the 20% FX neutral number that you gave, I know you said there is strength in BRIC and timing of tenders, so maybe you could just help us frame up those markets a little bit more broadly. We\u2019ve seen some disruption across the healthcare landscape there the past several quarters, how confident are you on being able to sustain call the mid-teens type growth rate in those franchises on a go-forward basis?","Ludwig N. Hantson","","Well the big one for us is clearly Brazil. I think we have a strong plan in place, the strategy is there. As Bob was saying we have converted 4,000 out of the 10,000 hemophilia A patients so far. Just to remind you, this was a plasma market. In addition to that it was an on-demand market. So we are moving from plasma to recombinant. In addition to that we are moving a lot of those patients from on-demand to pre-feed. So we feel pretty good with the strategy that we have in Brazil. So this is our biggest one. ","But in addition to that we have opportunities in China where we\u2019ve launched. In addition to that we got approval for ADVATE in Russia as well as in Turkey where we are launching and outside of these emerging growth markets clearly the UK tender as well as the Australian tender will continue to help us moving forward.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","And David across the entire business between medical products and BioScience, as we said medical products about 25% of sales already in emerging markets, very strong presence and with the renal franchise and the broad portfolio great opportunity to continue to grow there. BioScience has only penetrated about 15% of sales in emerging markets and that\u2019s really the opportunity here to continue to accelerate growth as Ludwig has laid out. So we feel very good about our positioning in emerging markets and the ability there to sustain double-digit growth going forward.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. There has been a lot of new job promotions and opportunities for people in the room so congratulations to all involved, but just two quick questions. The first one Bob Hombach, for next year and I appreciate you gave us some good details relating to step up cost and but I wonder if you could help us understand a couple of things. Is there sense of what the impact of FX could be for \u201815 given that cyclo competition has not happen yet this year, how you are thinking about cyclo for next year or any other important dynamics we should be thinking about for \u201815 numbers? And then what do we actually going to hear from an investment perspective in January Bob? And then a quick follow-up.","Robert J. Hombach","","Sure, so starting with FX, clearly very volatile timeframe here just within the last couple of weeks. As we indicated we expect an incremental headwind of about $0.04 here in the fourth quarter and given where rates have been throughout the course of the year where -- there was a timeframe where things looked like they might be getting slightly better. I think the fourth quarter, I think would be fairly indicative of what we are likely to see if rates stay where they are at today on a run rate basis. So yeah, we are probably in the \u201815 there $0.20 range of a headwind if rates stay where they are at today for 2015, but again lot of volatility here and we\u2019ll see where things are at as we get to January and give guidance. ","For cyclophosphamide we continue with a very robust competitive intelligence effort to understand where things are at, again we know there are seven or eight players who are awaiting approval. We continue to hear that it\u2019s likely to be in the not too distant future. But you know again the specificity around that just isn\u2019t great. So I think as you get to January we will have a better sense but again we framed that it\u2019s a $0.50 contributor to profit for Baxter and overtime we expect numerous entrants and the vast majority of that to go away with likely producing an impact in 2015. But at this point no further clarity that we have got to give.","So and as it relates to what you are going to hear in January you know we continue to work through a number of things here. But I think key assumptions like sales guidance I think we will be in very good position as we always give sales guidance for the franchises in the two businesses and in the process of doing that I think we will make very clear what our assumptions are on key value drivers like the hemophilia franchise like cyclophosphamide which will clearly have a very meaningful impact. ","We will also be able to give you a sense of FX and pension and so on. So while it may be a challenge to give a full P&L level of detail we normally do for the full year given the mid-year split I think we will be able to give you a lot information to give you a good sense of where the profitability trends are heading for each of the two businesses but very clearly be able to give you sales guidance.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, very helpful. And maybe a quick one for Bob Parkinson. You know Bob one of the key catalysts that coming out as we think about the Baxter business, the medical products business for next year and the year after is this dynamic of cost opportunity and some of the things you may be able to get after. It\u2019s not clear to us whether there is a true cost opportunity like an SG&A opportunity in medical products or the opportunity you see is more from portfolio reshaping which could be very positive for gross margins over time. So I think this is kind of shaping up as a kind of key investment debate. So maybe help us understand how do you see the cost opportunity broadly defined in medical products?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","","Sure David. So obviously as we get closer to the spin we will be in a position to be actually quite specific in terms of what are the elements that we believe are going to drive earnings for the new Bax if you will at a, I believe, meaningfully faster rate than top line revenue growth. Cost structure is very much part of that but let me just take a minute, maybe to comment on the other aspects or the other dimensions that we believe can drive margin improvement over time, first and foremost we have been very specific in terms of the future synergies associated with Gambro, both the margin drop through on commercial synergies as well as cost structure synergies, which I will tell we are tracking very well through 2014 and that\u2019s a material improvement overtime which will make a large contribution to the earnings growth of new Baxter, if you will, going forward.","Focus on mix shift of products so you know the re-launch of CIGMA, if you will with the recent approval provides great opportunity to recapture margin. I think I commented on this specifically in the last quarterly call but that\u2019s a big opportunity to regain market share in the infusion pump business, intensifying focus in areas that continue to be undeveloped markets on a global basis like biosurgery, like parenteral nutrition, and then of course the anesthesia franchise. So there is mix shift effect toward higher growth, higher margin products which also will contribute to accelerated bottom line growth.","Portfolio, you mentioned that in your question David, is also a big part of it and I tell you we will be very aggressive in evaluating the existing portfolio, not only from a business and product point of view but from a geographic point of view. There may be businesses that we want to stay in, in certain markets but exit in other market and obviously to do that will provide fuel for adding to that portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and so on. And then cost structure clearly is an element, I think once we are able to spit up the two new companies and we through that process obviously integrate all the corporate support functions in the two businesses and get a better line of sight I will tell you I think there is significant opportunity to fundamentally take up cost structure.","And then lastly, new product introductions like [inaudible] or next generation CRRT Systems, second generation infusion pump platform. So that kind of frames the various dimensions that will continue to margin enhancement and growth again at a faster rate than revenue and as we get close to the spin we will be in a position to be much more specific including the aspect of cost structure on all those elements okay.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","","Hi, everybody thanks for taking the questions. A couple of follow-ups, just to drill down a little bit in to hemophilia U.S. versus OUS, I mean you obviously have very strong worldwide number and driven by -- but in the U.S. just to understand how you're looking at the rest of the year. I guess what are you assuming in terms of the ADVATE launch, haven't seen much competition yet but are you still dialing in pressure in the back half that would be helpful color and one more follow-up?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Well thanks for question, Matt. First of all we continue to expect solid growth across the hemophilia franchise, both on the U.S. side as well as the international side. As far as the ADVATE U.S. market share is concerned we gave you guidance that we expect a decline of high single digits in between the Biogen launch and the 855 launch. So 855 continues to be on track, you have seen the Phase 3 data. We continue to move towards a BLA submission before the end of this year and as you saw Q3 sales data in the U.S. ADVATE remained strong. We grew by 8% and year-to-date we have a net patient gain versus previous year and this is on top of our continued prophy conversions. ","So we believe that since the launch date approval about four months ago we have seen a very minimal share loss and we're also aware that several patients switched back to ADVATE over the last weeks. And we realize that this data is still early but so far it\u2019s aligned with our expectations. ","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","And then one more, same subject, we talked about this before, there in our checks I guess and conversations indicate increasing interest in sort of fine tuning the dosing for patients and aligned with your PK analysis and data that you put out of couple of years ago, [My PK Fit] reaching the U.S., can you walk through maybe the timeline and how much of a factor is that going to be as you look at the competitive landscape over the next year. ","Ludwig N. Hantson","So one of our strategies is to continue to strengthen the ADVATE label. So as you know we just launched the [BAXA 3] device, [My PK Fit] is another opportunity for us to strengthen the label. We got approval in Europe and we are launching in selective countries as we speak for U.S., this is under regulatory review. It\u2019s a 510(k) submission. The impact of that will be very limited this year. This will be more a 2015 event. ","Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray","Thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened. ","Robert Hopkins - BAML ","Great thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Yeah we can Bob, go ahead. ","Robert Hopkins - BAML ","Great, thanks. Just a follow up on that ADVATE comment about anecdotally hearing that some patients are switching back, can you just kind of develop that little bit more what are the circumstances behind that, what's happened that they switched back and then I was just wondering if you could comment if your guidance that you gave last call, that you don\u2019t expect ADVATE share loss in the U.S. of more than single digits, if that still holds given what you are seeing. ","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yes. As I mentioned -- so thanks for the question Bob as I mentioned we expect that the ADVATE U.S. market share will decline high single digits between the launch and the 855 launch so to be more specific on the 855 launch, so submission before the end of this year. So 855 hitting the market by the end of next year. So that\u2019s the timeframe. Yes, we have anecdotes, we know of several patients who switched back for different reasons. I am not going to talk more about why those patients switched back but we're really pleased with the fact that ADVATE is the gold standard and remains the gold standard in hemophilia.","Robert Hopkins - BAML ","","So no change to that guidance?","Ludwig N. Hantson","No change in the guidance.","Robert Hopkins - BAML ","Okay. And then last question for me just very quickly on the back on the U.S. plasma side I know you walked through the U.S. result this quarter pretty fairly but I am just wondering was that number for the U.S. business about as you expected or was that a little bit weaker?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Well, I think the most important thing here is that U.S. demand for IG remains strong and is growing with the market which is double digit. So that is the critical piece here and then Bob was talking about we had a major event last year as well as we are gearing up for the HYQVIA launch, we want to make sure that space in the inventory for HYQVIA which we will be shipping next week.","Mary Kay Ladone","And Bob the major event that Lu is referring is the fact that we were able to enhance our capacity situation and in Q3 begin shipments at an increased level, so we had a difficult comp here in the third quarter.","Robert Hopkins - BAML ","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups to some of the earlier questions. So one will we see the full data set on 855 at ASH, that\u2019s going to\u2026?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Well we have submitted to ASH the design and now we are submitting at the late breaking news so we don\u2019t have a full yes yet, so we will keep you posted. Having said that I think we have disclosed the most critical information on the 855 study with all of you and again to repeat what the key messages were. First of all we had great control of bleeding 95% of the bleeds were reduced; 40% of the patients were bleed free. No inhibitors, no cases of hypersensitivity and with the PK profile extension of 40% to 50% versus ADVATE. So these were the key messages. We will keep you posted if it will be an ASH event.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay, and Ludwig, while I\u2019ve got you here on 826 can you just give us an update on when you think you will be in the humans with that?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Our objective is by the end of next year that we will be in studies.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay. Want to clarify just the commentary Bob Hombach on 2015 and expectations or set expectations around guidance, so in January you\u2019ll guide for revenues and you\u2019ll gave some other items but you don\u2019t actually gave EPS guidance for 2015 is that correct?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, we certainly will for the first half of the year, but for the full year it becomes very tricky with the mid-year separation at the investor conference in early Q2 would be the timeframe I think when we would lay out the full year picture in more detail for both companies.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","And that first half guidance you are saying you will exclude the dis-synergies that you will start to incur in the first half, you\u2019ll actually back those out?","Robert J. Hombach","Well we do expect that to be fairly minor because we will time the adding the resources that creates a duplicative corporate overhead as and when we need to in order to be prepared and appropriately prepared on July 1. So there will be some cost there but we don\u2019t expect that aspect of it will be overly significant but we will call that out separately yes.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay, last question for you and I will drop. You reiterate your cash flow guidance for the year but I was looking at the cash flow statement, looks like you are down 2% for the year, your guidance is $3.5 billion which is close to up 10%. So is that, you are confident in the big fourth quarter in your cash flows?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes if we look at things, working capital was a bit below, a bigger drain on cash flow here in the third quarter than last year, receivables and payables in particular, some of that just have to do with the timing of a strong sales quarter and when that occurred and when we are likely to collect that. So yes there is a big fourth quarter here driven primarily by the timing on some of these working capital items.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Great, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lawrence Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","To circle back on HYQVIA, and I just want to get some further thoughts on the ability to line up the patients the care givers and the payers as you launch that product as well as see if you are willing to talk at all about price? And then for Bob Parkinson, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the environment that you are seeing both in the U.S. and overseas in the med products business J&J obviously indicated that there was some slightly improvements in utilization just want to see what you guys are seeing?","Ludwig N. Hantson","So with respect to HYQVIA we are really pleased with the approval and we\u2019re gearing up as was mentioned. We are planning to ship product next week and that\u2019s on target. When our goal for HYQVIA is to be the preferred and leading subcu treatment for PID and that should be supported by differentiation and we plan to expand HYQVIA into neurological indications in the coming year, so beyond PID. ","At this moment there is a broad market awareness, there is high interest from physicians patients on HYQVIA and we are expecting accelerated sales in Q4. Which respect to pricing we\u2019re introducing HYQVIA to the PBMs and the payers as we speak. Our pricing strategy is consistent with HYQVIA\u2019s differentiated and unique value which is to provide subcu IG treatment that can be administered once a month. A dose is equivalent to that of IV IG. So with respect to the price consistent with Europe we will be launching at a price premium.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ","I understand. Can you say how much that might be?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","At this point Larry you know until we get things finalized and get some traction in the market place I think it\u2019s premature to talk about that.","Robert J. Hombach","Okay.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Larry, Bob Parkinson here in terms of hospital utilization I did see J&J\u2019s comments, I guess our view would be pretty much in line with that. Clearly hospital activity in developed markets around the world is not as dormant as it was a year ago. So I would say there is a slight improvement there but falling far short of being robust. I think I would distinguish that however, from the emerging markets and allow the general economies of the emerging markets have been softer than anticipated. ","In terms of dollar spin on healthcare these markets continue to dedicate more of their national budgets to healthcare. So you got so many therapies and procedures that previously there was no access or limited access in undeveloped market. So we do see a more robust growth underlying demand in emerging markets.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get a little bit better sense of exactly where some of the investment spending is taking place and to what extent, just talking there I guess the underlying net income growth of the company, if you were to take out the Gambro accretion for the share, because it looks like next year, just adding up some of the things that you had referenced with $0.50 for cyclo, you have got separation added dis-synergy cost FX, I assume pension may actually be a headwind next year. It just seems that next year\u2019s shaping up to be a challenging year, potentially more of the decline in overall performance, [inaudible] to the underlying business.","Robert J. Hombach","Sure, sure. Well again I think we are pleased with the strong organic top line growth of the underlying business that we\u2019ve seen across some of the key franchise this year and good strong momentum there that we expect that to carry forward in to next year. As we look at some of these high leverage variables it\u2019s a little difficult sitting here in October to have a clear sense of where some of these are going to go. As we mentioned cyclo but the longer this goes, the more likely it is that not just one but multiple players will get approval in fairly short order which means that the market dynamic could change pretty dynamically and the impact could be accelerated. ","So again we are looking at $0.50. I don\u2019t have a sense of how much of that would impact 2015 at this point but that will be a very high leverage variable depending upon when that occurs. As I mentioned earlier FX at current rates would be around $0.15 to $0.20 headwind incrementally but again a lot of volatility there, pension interest rates have moved dramatically in the last two or three weeks. That has certainly become more of a potential headwind, as we have gauged it previous, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate amounts to about $20 million impact to the P&L. ","So we have seen about 75 basis points move here relative to where it was last year. There are other factors that play into that including asset returns and so on, so that\u2019s not necessarily a one for one but thinking about that at the moment in the $50 million to $60 million potential headwind at this point at current interest rates would be where we will be at, at the moment. So stripping a lot of that out and if you look at Baxter today ex-FX in 2014 we are talking about operating income growth in high single digits here. So I think the operating performance has been very good. We are cautiously making incremental investment though in SG&A to support multiple new product launches in BioScience that have already occurred and could occur going forward. ","We have ramped up R&D expense a bit as well through some of business development activity that we have done within bio that will continue into 2015 as well. We did talk about some of the operational challenges, largely driven by very strong demand in PD and IV solutions as well that are causing us some incremental headwinds here and some of that is likely to continue into next year. I will gauge that in the fourth quarter as approximately a $0.03 headwind or around $20 million to $25 million of incremental impact that we are likely to see operationally within medical products.","So a lot of moving pieces here and a lot of volatility around a few of these factors. So again a bit early to look at the picture for 2015 but I think the underlying business is actually performing pretty well.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","What is the underlying business ex the contribution from Gambro from an earnings perspective?","Robert J. Hombach","We talked about a 4% top-line growth and with some leverage in the P&L. So I would gauge it in the mid to high single digits today.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just in terms of the cost you guys had mentioned with business optimization cost that offset spending on quality, how should we just think about the quality spend and can you just remind me if you have any outstanding FDA warning letters or notable 483s?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Yes Kristen, Bob Parks, maybe let me take that because most of that activity would be in the new vacs domain. One of the challenges that we are managing through right now is a combination of one hand, expanding capacity on both IVs and PD where we are experiencing unprecedented growth on PD in the United States and pretty robust demand for IVs while concurrently managing through some existing warning letters and ensuring that we continue to enhance our production standards. I mean we are focusing on areas like particular container integrity and some of these areas that as we expand capacity we have to make sure that we maintain the focus on these other quality issues, particularly in facilities that are older and facilities in most notably North Carolina, where we have an outstanding warning letter.","So we want to balance expansion of capacity on one hand, yet be very vigilant to ensure that we have acceptable -- meet acceptable quality standards and that\u2019s really the area that we are investing. And so we have added headcount there, investment in terms of process modifications and so on while we are also expanding capacity. In fact we are bringing on a new line in [North Co] to produce more PD solutions to assist us in managing through some of the short-term product shortages that we have that hopefully we will be able to manage through that, through I would say the first quarter of 2015.","But we are sensitive to the existing warning letters and make sure we can bring those to a close at a time when we are expanding capacity. I will tell you we have very constructive dialog going with the agency. We actually had a regulatory meeting with them last week to talk about how we balance achieving systemic or systematic improvements really in quality and ensure that the supply issue is addressed. You may recall a year ago the U.S. market was in very short supply on IV solutions, and here we are approaching flu season and we read about Ebola and all these other things. ","So the agency is very sensitive as they should be as are we to supply. It\u2019s why we are encouraged that they stepped in and provided the kind of support they did to approve PD product to be manufactured in Castlebar, Ireland to ship to the U.S. to help address our issue. So those are the things we are balancing and Bob kind of quantified the financial impact of that, that will continue for a while but I think at a certain point we will certainly manage down those costs and get back to a more normalized level.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thank you. We have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Thanks for taking my question. Ludwig there is just kind of a general anxiousness about the pace of change in the hemophilia A treatment optionality as it were. The [two] molecule the bio specific antibody mimics the co factor behavior factor A could be subcu, could be relatively long lasting good in inhibitor patients and relative low immunogenicity. Could you just comment on molecules such as this and your long-term positioning of the company and give some assurance that Baxter has the options covered is it were?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yeah, so, well thanks for the Bruce. We believe that we have a solid short-term and long-term strategy for our hemophilia franchise. As you know we are building breadth and depth in our hemophilia portfolio and I think it\u2019s also fair to say that we are doing better at hitting the R&D milestones. We continue to monitor the competitive landscape and we are aware of the technologies that you were mentioning, the [inaudible] opportunity well the company is still in early clinical development and the clinical data is limited. ","As a matter of fact one of our exploratory programs is in subcu technology and a couple of years we moved the subcu treatment into the clinic. However we have to stop the program because of the lack of efficacy. To go back to our strategy we believe we have a strong strategy. First of all we continue to strengthen the ADVATE label we talked about [My PK Fits] as well as well as Baxter-3 we have strong Phase 3 data for 855, which we will be submitting by the end of this year. We plan to bring 826 as well as our gene therapy program for hemophilia A into the clinic into the next 12 to 18 months and all of these are the programs that we have. ","So 855, 826 and gene therapy we believe are programs that are post proof-of-concept. When you think about the ultimate goal of hemophilia treatment it is to have sustainable higher level of factor expression without peaks and troughs because you will induce -- you would see dramatic or spontaneous bleeds and the protection should be there irrespective of the patients activity level and we believe that gene therapy could be a true game changer. And with respect to our progress in the technology we are really pleased with early clinical date in our hemophilia B program. We see factor level expression in our patients that is sustained over a longer period of time and as I mentioned we are planning to bring this to the clinic in about a year from now.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","","And Bob my follow-up pertains to the U.S. dialyzer opportunity you know there was a press release this quarter about enhancing your manufacturing capability. Could you just scale that opportunity for us because I know Baxter is a little bit light on the share side, how big is it, is it something that should be considered as a major initiative for the new Baxter?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr."," ","Yeah, well that\u2019s Bruce, Bob Parkinson here, so clearly expansion of dialyzer capacity is one of multiple drivers to the renal growth long-term, as I think you know even before the acquisition Gambro was constrained on capacity on dialyzer. Our share on dialyzers today is obviously disproportionately low so I think there is a significant opportunity there long-term. ","We are encouraged by the recent performance of the Gambro business in the third quarter. Our sales were up mid-single digits and we are starting to I think get focused and aligned after the integration. So that will represent a step function in growth when that capacity comes on in 2016 but in the mean time we have done some other things with third party suppliers and so on which will allow us to increase the supply. ","So right now the demand is exceeding our ability to supply. We have some smaller interim expansions that should help that out in the short-term but it won\u2019t be as material until the OPELIKA capacity comes on. So that\u2019s a significant opportunity and a significant driver for long-term renal growth for us.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","","And how big is the U.S. market for dialyzers?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr."," ","In terms of, in dollars?","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","","Yeah.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yeah, so just defining the Gambro businesses we acquired it the dialyzers represented about $500 million in sales for Gambro on a global basis but as Bob mentioned very underrepresented in the U.S. market and through this OPELIKA expansion and the others that Bob mentioned we expect that over three to four years to increase capacity by 50%. And so as we grow into that capacity this represents an opportunity to grow and grow share and grow up 50% off the $500 million base that we have got in the coming years.","So a fairly meaningful opportunity here but clearly given the very low monitor placements that Gambro had historically in the U.S. and overall capacity constraints again very, very small player at the moment.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Mary Kay can get back to you Bruce with the exact specific answer to your question. I don\u2019t know for the U.S. market. The reality is the production at OPELIKA will source global markets not just the U.S. and the largest opportunity is outside the U.S. for a number of reasons including obviously the concentration with Fresenius given their centers that they run and where they utilize their own dialyzers and so that\u2019s a major segment of the U.S. market that largely is off the table even when we get expanded capacity. So this is really more of a global opportunity but we will get back to you with the specifics on that.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Mary Kay Ladone","And our last question please.","Operator","Our last question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, good morning guys. Two questions, one for Ludwig and one for Bob Parkinson. Ludwig outside the U.S. the hemophilia franchise did very well and you called out Brazil and you called out some tenders. I am curious about the tenders; I think those tenders are UK and Australia. When you start on a new tender, is there a channel fill and are the sales you see there one time or are these just remain sustainable at current levels into the fourth quarter of next year is there any way you can quantify what the tenders gave you in the third quarter? ","And then for Bob Parkinson, some of the companies that have reported so far have talked about some softness in Europe. I am wondering if you can comment on what you are seeing on the supply side of the business in Europe? Thank you.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, Glenn it\u2019s Bob Hombach, let me answer the financial aspects of the tenders and maybe Ludwig can make some comments about our somewhat unique position particularly in Australia. So the UK and Australia represent very good opportunity for us. We had very little share in the UK from the last tender and we are completely out of the Australian market. And so I would frame these as about $50 million in incremental sales opportunity combined between the two. ","We will realize about $20 million of that $50 million here in the back half of 2014, less than $10 million contribution in the third quarter ramping up a bit in the fourth and the other $30 million of that $50 million we\u2019ll get in 2015 as we get up to scale. I guess but the one thing I would add about Australia is our preferred position there in the tender gives us an opportunity to perhaps get disproportionate share of the overall Australian market which may allow us to go a bit above the $50 million overall that I mentioned.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Glenn repeat your question on the supply side Europe, I wasn\u2019t sure what you are getting out there if you could just maybe rephrase that?","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","So if you look at some other companies that have reported so far this week they have talked about some softness in Europe so I was wondering what you are seeing if you can provide any commentary in Europe. I know in 3Q you always getting to see some softness due to seasonality but I wonder if there is anything from an economic point of view that or whatever you are seeing that would create any softness in Europe at this point?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Yes well I commented earlier on just hospital activity of developed markets versus emerging markets and distinguishing the two. I would say Europe clearly Western Europe is the softest area globally and I think to a large degree that is directly correlated with the general economic condition Glenn. So we see less robust demand in Europe for example than we do in the United States and I would project that given the broader macroeconomic environment that\u2019s likely to continue.","So it\u2019s really about market share to drive growth and so on as opposed to depend upon robust underlying hospital activity if you will.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s conference call with Baxter International.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you, all, for calling in. As you saw in the press release that was issued earlier this morning, Baxter reported solid financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the quarter, adjusted earnings of $1.26 per diluted share were consistent with our guidance. On a global basis, sales, excluding currency, advanced 17%. And after adjusting for Gambro and currency, Baxter sales advanced 6%, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. For the year, adjusted earnings increased 3% to $4.67 per diluted share and sales, excluding currency, advanced 8%. After adjusting for both Gambro and currency, sales increased 4%.","I'm pleased that we continue to meet our financial objectives while navigating a challenging and complex macro environment, and have consistently generated significant cash flow while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy of returning value to shareholders through both increased dividends and share repurchases.","Before I turn the call over to Bob Hombach for additional commentary regarding the financial results and also the full year 2014 outlook, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the progress that our company has made, particularly in 2013, to improve our operational and commercial execution, advance the pipeline and position Baxter for future growth and success.","First, Baxter continues to improve operational and commercial effectiveness, and derive significant benefits by taking full advantage of existing opportunities to bring products and therapies to various markets more effectively. This includes geographic expansion, particularly in emerging markets where Baxter's 2013 annual sales exceeded $3.2 billion, advancing more than 10% for the year. We capitalized on the innovative partnership with Hemobras in Brazil with the commencement of shipments to enhance access to Baxter's recombinant factor VIII therapy for the treatment of hemophilia. Baxter will be the exclusive provider of Brazil's recombinant factor VIII treatment over a 10-year period while we work together on a technology transfer to support development of local manufacturing capabilities. As you may recall, we expect peak annual sales related to this partnership to be material and approach $200 million by 2017. We've already converted more than 2,000 patients to Baxter's therapy, representing about 20% of treated patients.","We also remain committed to meeting patient demands by enhancing our plasma manufacturing footprint. As you know, we're investing in a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia, and also completed planned modifications at the older Los Angeles plasma fractionation facility. The Los Angeles and Covington investments, augmented by other improvements across the network and the Sanquin collaboration, position Baxter well to meet the growing demand for immunoglobulin and other plasma-based therapies in both the short- and long-term in a flexible and also a very cost-effective manner.","During 2013, Baxter continued to transform the new product pipeline into a robust portfolio of products and therapies that improve the quality of care and address key high-potential areas of unmet medical need. This is evidenced by our increased spending in research development to a record level; achievement of a number of clinical and regulatory milestones, including the progression of several key programs into late-stage clinical trials, completion of regulatory submissions and approval of an array of new indications and treatments; the announcement of several collaborations that leverage Baxter's proven expertise and extend the pipeline into new therapeutic areas, including hematology, oncology and immunology; and the completion of the Gambro AB acquisition, which enhances Baxter's global leadership in renal therapies and provides a number of longer-term opportunities and significant cost synergies.","Momentum accelerated in the fourth quarter with several pipeline achievements, including:","The submission of an amended Biologics License Application or BLA to the FDA to reinitiate the review process for approval of HyQvia, a subcutaneous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with primary immunodeficiency. As you know, HyQ was approved and then launched in a number of European countries in the second half of 2013.","Conclusion of the enrollment in the Phase III clinical trial of BAX 855, an investigational extended half-life recombinant factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A. The ongoing trial is aimed at assessing the efficacy of the compound in reducing annualized bleed rates in both prophylaxis and on-demand treatment schedules and will also evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetic profile. BAX 855 was designed based on the full-length ADVATE molecule and modified with PEGylation technology. To date, no inhibitors or safety issues have been reported in the study.","The BLA submission to the FDA for the approval of OBI-1, a recombinant porcine factor VIII for patients with acquired hemophilia A. OBI-1 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the application has been granted a priority review, which is intended to expedite the review process of drug candidates with the potential to fulfill an unmet medical need. Also, the submission of an application to the FDA for a pediatric indication for RIXUBIS to treat hemophilia B. We've also submitted a marketing authorization application for patients of all ages in Japan and to the European Medicines Agency. RIXUBIS was approved in the United States for adults with hemophilia B in 2013.","Also, the FDA approval for Baxter's FEIBA as the first and only treatment in the U.S. for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors. The presence of an inhibitor makes response to treatment more challenging, and patients with inhibitors have an increased risk of developing complications. This approval builds on our leading prophylaxis platform that we've established with ADVATE, and more recently, with RIXUBIS. As you may know, in clinical trials, the FEIBA prophylactic regimen showed a 72% reduction in median annual bleed rate compared to treatment with an on-demand regimen. FEIBA is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide and is indicated for prophylaxis in more than 40 countries, with annual sales that exceed $600 million.","We also received CE Marking in Europe for the VIVIA hemodialysis system, designed to deliver more frequent, extended-duration, short-daily or nocturnal Home HD therapy. VIVIA is designed with the potential to deliver enhanced clinical outcomes and greater patient convenience and provides a number of unique safety features, wireless connectivity, an integrated water system and extended-use consumables. Baxter will introduce VIVIA in a limited number of European dialysis clinics in 2014 and expand the launch to other European countries in 2015.","And finally, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Cell Therapeutics, Inc. to develop and commercialize pacritinib, a novel investigational JAK2\/FLT3 inhibitor currently in Phase III development for patients with myelofibrosis, a chronic malignant bone marrow disorder. Under the terms of the agreement, Baxter gains exclusive commercialization rights for all indications outside the United States, and Baxter and Cell Therapeutics will jointly commercialize pacritinib in the United States.","So as you can see, we're beginning to realize value from the significant R&D investment that we've made over the years. We currently are engaged in 7 key Phase III clinical trials. We're awaiting approval for several key new programs, and launching 5 new products in 2014.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to provide you with an update on several additional items. First, we did recently receive an FDA warning letter, primarily directed to our quality systems in Round Lake, Illinois, for certain medical devices. We've been working to address the FDA's initial 43 observations, including through a global quality system improvement plan, which we've reviewed with the Agency and which we're in the progress of implementing. In light of the letter's focus, we do not anticipate an impact on product availability for patients.","Second, while it took longer than we expected to complete the regulatory process, we're pleased with the progress we're making on the integration of Gambro. The Baxter-Gambro renal leadership team, under Rob Davis, comprised of experienced leaders from both Baxter and Gambro, are focused on a number of opportunities to enhance growth and profitability in this core franchise. This includes enhancing patient outcomes in chronic and acute kidney treatments, driving further penetration of key products in both developed and emerging markets, launching new products, such as VIVIA, our new Home HD therapy in Europe, expanding capacity to meet growing demand for PD therapy and dialyzers, and optimizing our manufacturing, operations and business support functions. We look forward to updating you on the progress with these initiatives and the integration throughout the year.","And finally, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long term with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. An important aspect of our strategy is to ensure that we position our company for sustainable and profitable growth, and this includes an ongoing evaluation of our portfolio, including selectively divesting assets that are no longer core to our long-term objectives and executing new business development initiatives, partnerships and collaborations that leverage our core capabilities and global channel. The recent announcement of plans to explore strategic options related to our vaccine and cell therapy programs, combined with the new partnerships that we've announced, are examples of the discipline that we've exhibited in this regard.","So thanks for that, and now, I'll ask Bob to review financial results for the quarter and also guidance for 2014. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter, excluding special items, were $1.26 per diluted share, in line with our previously issued guidance. As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP results include after-tax special items of $366 million, primarily associated with cost related to the Gambro acquisition, previously announced collaborations and business optimization initiatives. The business optimization initiatives include the elimination of a number of positions as we continue to streamline operations, rationalize our manufacturing footprint and optimize general and administrative functions. It also includes costs related to the decision to explore strategic options for our vaccines and cell therapies R&D programs.","Annual savings are expected to total approximately $0.17 per share when fully implemented in 2015, which includes savings of approximately $0.13 for 2014, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested in promotional and marketing activities to support ongoing new product launches on a global basis.","Now, let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to our financial outlook for 2014. Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4.4 billion advanced 16%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 17%. Excluding Gambro revenues of $413 million, Baxter's sales rose 5% and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 6%, which exceeded our guidance range primarily due to strong demand for ADVATE and FEIBA, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Sales in the base Baxter business improved sequentially, driven by accelerated growth in emerging markets, as we benefited from certain government collaborations, as well as strong performance across the hemophilia franchise and Medical Products. For the full year, worldwide sales of $15.3 billion advanced 8% on both a reported and constant currency basis, but excluding Gambro revenues, which contributed $513 million in 2013, Baxter's sales increased 4% on both a reported and constant currency basis.","In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales of approximately $1.8 billion advanced 5% in the fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 6%. For the full year, global BioScience sales also increased 5% to more than $6.5 billion, and after adjusting for foreign currency, sales rose 6%, exceeding our expectation of sales growth in the 4% to 5% range.","Within the product categories, hemophilia sales of $972 million increased 10%, or 11% on a constant currency basis, representing the strongest quarterly performance in recent years. This is the result of capitalizing on our global leadership position and brand differentiation, broadening our portfolio with new product launches like RIXUBIS for the treatment of hemophilia B and expanding access to care, particularly in emerging markets. Specifically, global demand for ADVATE remains strong as we continue to benefit from our label expansion and improved prophylaxis penetration in both the U.S. and Europe. This was augmented by a benefit from shipments to Brazil as part of our ongoing partnership with Hemobras to enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy in the world's third largest hemophilia market. We've now converted more than 20% of the total patients and generated incremental sales of approximately $70 million in 2013.","In BioTherapeutics, sales of $564 million declined 1% on a reported basis and were down 2% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the U.S. of 7% was a result of improved product availability and growth of immunoglobulin therapies, albumin and Alpha-1 treatments. This performance was more than offset by lower sales in international markets, primarily the result of lower albumin sales in China and decisions to exit certain markets due to previous supply constraints.","Sales in BioSurgery of $194 million increased 8%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 7%, driven by solid demand across the entire portfolio of surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL.","Finally, vaccine revenues totaled $46 million in the quarter and declined 6%. On a constant currency basis, sales were comparable to last year and strong demand for our core vaccines was offset by lower milestone payments related to our ongoing collaborations on the development of influenza vaccines.","In Medical Products, global sales in the fourth quarter were approximately $2.6 billion and increased 25%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 27%. Excluding Gambro, Medical Products sales grew 5%, or 7% on a constant currency basis, with solid growth across all product categories. For the full year, Medical Products sales increased 9% to approximately $8.7 billion, and after adjusting for foreign currency, sales were in line with our expectations and advanced 10%.","Within the product categories, renal sales totaled approximately $1.1 billion and including Gambro sales of more than $400 million, which were in line with expectations. Excluding Gambro, renal sales increased 2%, or 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong PD growth of 6% to 7%, which continues to be driven by strong patient gains in the U.S. and emerging markets.","Sales in the fluid systems category of $819 million increased 6% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Performance continues to be driven by demand for IV solutions and injectable drugs as well as price improvements for the injectable oncology drug cyclophosphamide, which collectively more than offset lower international sales.","Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $407 million, reflecting an increase of 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. Strong global anesthesia growth offset lower sales of nutritional therapies in the U.S., resulting from supplier shortages of distributed vitamins and lipids.","Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $267 million, which improved -- with improved growth of 11% on a reported basis or 12% on a constant currency basis. This performance can be attributed to the timing of orders and shipments as we've alleviated supply constraints experienced in late 2012 and earlier this year.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 49.5%, with the full year gross margin of 51.1% in line with our expectations and guidance. For the quarter, the gross margin benefited from products mix and price improvements, particularly for cyclophosphamide. These benefits were more than offset by the integration of the lower-margin Gambro business, which negatively impacted the ratio by 150 basis points, as well as other headwinds, including foreign currency, pension, austerity measures and the realization of additional costs associated with modifications and the ramp-up of production at our Los Angeles fractionation facilities.","SG&A totaled $940 million and increased 16%, with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the growth. Excluding Gambro, SG&A increased 2%, given tight management of expenses, which was offset by select investments in promotional and marketing initiatives, new product launches and within international markets to enhance our global presence. For the full year, SG&A increased 9% and excluding Gambro, spending increased 4%. R&D spending in the quarter of $304 million increased 16% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro, R&D spending rose 3% and continues to be driven by investments we are making to advance a number of programs in our pipeline, including those in our leading hemophilia franchise and programs to leverage our expertise in the therapeutic areas of hematology, oncology and immunology, as well as investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the continuum of care. R&D for the full year approached $1.1 billion, a record level for the company.","Operating margin in the quarter of 21% is lower than last year's operating margin of 23.8%, as leverage in the base Baxter business was offset by the factors impacting gross margin and the addition of Gambro. Interest expense was $41 million compared to $22 million last year due to the new debt issuances within the last year to fund both the Covington plasma manufacturing site and the Gambro acquisition. The tax rate was 23.3% for the quarter, somewhat higher than expected due to earnings mix and a minor discrete item affecting our tax reserves. The full year tax rate was 22%, in line with our guidance. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.26 is flat to the prior year. Full year 2013 adjusted earnings of $4.67 per diluted share increased 3%. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion improved by almost $100 million versus the prior year. This includes after-tax cash costs associated with the Gambro acquisition of more than $60 million. Excluding these costs, cash flow from operations was in line with our full year objective.","DSO ended the quarter at 55.9 days, and excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 52.5 days, lower than the prior year by almost a full day. Inventory turns of 2.7 are higher than the 2.5 turns in the prior year period, due to stronger sales and inventory management. And lastly for 2013, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares for $913 million, or on a net basis, 4 million shares for $439 million, slightly more than our full year objective.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2014. As we previously communicated, going forward, we will report and provide guidance that excludes the impact of intangible amortization and other special items. Intangible asset amortization books entirely to cost of goods sold and for the full year 2013, totaled approximately $0.19 per diluted share. And as mentioned in our press release, the estimate for 2014 is approximately $0.25 per diluted share. For 2013, we provided a quarterly financial statement including this adjustment, which was included on Page 14 of our press release issued this morning and additional historical financial statements can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Moving on to the guidance. For the full year 2014, we expect adjusted earnings of $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share. You may note that we are providing a larger guidance range than our historical practice as we have a number of factors and assumptions impacting this year's financial outlook. Our 2014 guidance includes a benefit from pension of approximately $0.14, savings related to our business optimization initiatives over the last 2 years of approximately $0.18, an accretion from Gambro acquisition of $0.20 to $0.25 per share, in line with our original expectations. These tailwinds are more than offset by foreign currency and austerity measures of approximately $0.25 and cyclophosphamide composition of $0.20 to $0.30 per share.","Specifically, by line item for the P&L, starting with sales, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 9% to 10%, and this includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 8% to 9%. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales to grow approximately 2% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we expect gross margin for the company to decline by approximately 150 basis points from the restated 2013 margin of 52%. By quarter, we expect the gross margin to be fairly stable due to the timing of certain headwinds and tailwinds and our assumptions related to new competitive entrants.","In terms of expenses, we expect SG&A to increase in mid-single digits and R&D to grow in low single digits. Both line items reflect leverage in the Baxter expense base and the addition of Gambro. We expect interest expense to total approximately $160 million and other income to total an expense of approximately $15 million for the full year. We expect the tax rate to improve to approximately 21.5%, which includes a benefit related to the structure of the Gambro transaction, and we expect full year average share count of approximately 547 million shares, which assumes approximately $300 million in net share repurchases.","From a cash flow perspective, we expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5 billion. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia. I'd note that 2014 is our peak year of capital spending. In 2015 and beyond, we expect capital expenditures to begin to moderate towards approximately $1.5 billion.","Let me move to sales and expand on our assumptions for the 2 businesses and the major product categories. Beginning with Medical Products, on a constant currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro, we expect sales growth of approximately 13% to 14%. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 0 to 1%. Specifically, we expect renal sales to grow approximately 40%, including the benefit of continued PD penetration, the incremental revenue contribution from Gambro, as well as commercial synergies. We expect fluid systems sales to decline 3% to 5%, reflecting the impact of lower cyclophosphamide sales. As we mentioned last quarter, if we have 2 competitors by midyear, the sales and pretax impact would equate to $150 million to $200 million. We expect specialty pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in the 3% to 5% range. And we expect our BioPharma Solutions sales growth to be in low-single digits for the year.","For BioScience, we project sales growth on a constant currency basis of 3% to 4%. Our outlook includes growth of 4% to 5% in our hemophilia franchise, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived factor VIII and factor IX therapies and FEIBA, an inhibitor treatment. While we expect increased competition for recombinant factor VIII therapies in the second half of this year, performance will be fueled by underlying global demand for ADVATE, where we continue to realize benefits associated with the new expanded label, incremental sales related to the Brazil collaboration and new tender awards, as well as the benefit from new product launches, including RIXUBIS, OBI-1 and FEIBA prophylaxis.","For the BioTherapeutics franchise, which includes IG therapies, albumin and Alpha-1 treatments, we expect growth of approximately 4%. This plan includes a contribution from HyQvia, as well as accelerated volume growth of immunoglobulin therapies and Alpha-1 treatments. However, given production timing and the license renewal process for albumin in China, we're expecting flat albumin sales on a global basis for the year.","In BioSurgery, we expect growth in the 5% to 7% range. And finally, we expect our vaccine sales to decline by 10% to 15% as a result of lower milestone payments related to our influenza development programs, which we have discontinued.","As mentioned in our press release, for the first quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.06 to $1.09, which excludes intangible amortization and any special items. We expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 13% to 14%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth to grow 11% to 12%. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales at constant currency rates to grow 2% to 3%.","In terms of calendarization of our earnings guidance for 2014, as I mentioned earlier, there are a number of headwinds which are more pronounced in the first half of the year, namely, foreign currency and incremental interest expense. In fact, we expect approximately 80% of the FX headwind to occur in the first half of the year, with 50% of the full year impact occurring in the first quarter alone. In the second half of the year, we expect increased competition in a couple of key product areas, which will be partially offset by synergies related to Gambro and savings related to our business optimization initiatives.","In closing, the midpoint of our guidance range for the year assumes low-single digit EPS growth in the first half of 2014 and EPS growth in mid-to-high single digits in the second half of the year.","And now, let me open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International's website for 30 days at www.baxter.com.","Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bob, you talked a little bit about the BioTherapeutics business, specifically albumin. Can you just sort of update us on sort of the timeline and what's changed? It sounds like there was going to be a fourth quarter registration issue with China. It sounds like it's delayed maybe a couple of quarters. So maybe walk us through in sort of when you think the resolution could be. And then related to IVIG, is most of the issue really tied to albumin or are there still some lingering capacity issues on IVIG?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. So first off, no capacity issues on IVIG. We've exited 2013 running at the levels that we expect, and as we've said, we'll be able to support at least 6% to 8% volume growth for '14 and '15 out of our existing network. As it relates to albumin in China, yes, we expect here in the fourth quarter -- excuse me, in the first quarter to hear on the second license. We've already gotten approval for the first license renewal. And so -- but given the timing of when that approval comes and the manufacturing cycle for the product, it's likely that we wouldn't be able to get product into China for the second product until late this year. So that will impact from a timing perspective. And given the price points in China relative to other markets, we will have some mix impact there, but we will be able to redeploy the albumin into other markets during the course of the year.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful, Bob. And I appreciate all the detail you gave on the headwinds and tailwinds here for 2014. I guess, the dynamic we'd love to get more visibility on is, we know all these tailwinds are -- certain headwinds are out there. We obviously don't know the timing of some of those headwinds, so your guidance sort of assumes those headwinds. But could you help us understand specific knowledge in cyclo and Suprane, where do you think the competitive launches sit? And what specifically is sort of incorporated in the guidance in terms of when you expect to see that pressure? I also wondered if you could update us on the timelines for rigosertib, HyQ and 855?","Robert J. Hombach","So in terms of the competitive timing, we don't have a lot more insight than we've had in the past. We know there are a number of folks on the cyclo side who have applied for approval. But visibility to having gotten approval and ready to launch is not great at this point. So, again, our assumption is approximately by midyear, we have 2 competitors in the market, and if so, that creates a $150 million to $200 million bottom line exposure for the company. So that's effectively what's baked into our guidance. We have widened the range some, what we would normally do to account for the fact that competitors may come in a little earlier, may come in a little bit later, it may be 1, may be 2, or maybe more this year. There isn't a lot more visibility to that on the cyclo side than what we've talked about up to this point. And as it relates to Suprane, the competitor has the ability to enter the U.S. market as of January 1 of this year. We've not seen them do that yet, but again, I'm not sure why that is and so we really can't comment on that. But we do expect, for the majority of this year, that we do face some competition. I would say on Suprane, though, we've always viewed that as more of an evolutionary impact and not that significant in 2014.","Robert L. Parkinson","And do the new products market.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, David, you were asking about rigosertib, HyQ and was there a third?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","855, Mary Kay.","Mary Kay Ladone","855. So I'll start with 855. As you know, we're completely enrolled in the Phase III clinical trial and we expect to complete the trial sometime in Q3 and have data then and file before the end of the year for 855. So things are going fairly well there. On HyQ, really no change. We submitted the amended BLA and we expect a 6-month review, so we should hear sometime around midyear on the approval of HyQ for the U.S. Rigosertib, we are currently awaiting the data on the high-risk MDS trial. We expect that here sometime in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One financial follow-up question and then one broader strategic question. First, just on the financial piece. Bob, maybe you could go into a little bit more detail. If you look at the gross margin line in 2014, 150-basis point decline on an adjusted basis. Is there a way to tease out how much of that is isolated to 2014 in terms of competition and changes in business mix or austerity, et cetera, versus what is sort of a structural change in the profitability of your business when you include Gambro?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, absolutely. And so of that 150-basis point change in gross margin, I think about it in 3 buckets that are roughly equal impact. One is Gambro, and that's almost purely from a mix standpoint, they are, at the moment, a lower-margin business than Baxter. But, structurally, over time, we do expect, as we talked about, to drive the majority of the overall $300 million in cost synergies, we expect to drive those in the margin line. So over time, we expect that to improve. But for 2014, the mix impact of bringing Gambro in for a full year into Baxter results is about 50 basis points on the gross margin. Cyclo also contributes about a 50-basis point impact to the gross margin, given the high contribution margin of that and the magnitude of the impact. Again, we expect numerous entrants to come in, in '14 and '15, so I view this as more of a '14, '15 issue. We think by the end of '15, given the normal trajectory of a generic situation, the vast majority of what's in our base today for cyclo will be out the company results by then. And then the third bucket, which is, again, about 40 to 50 basis points, is foreign exchange. And that's a combination of both emerging market FX -- as you know, since May of last year emerging market currencies have really deteriorated pretty significantly against the U.S. dollar, pretty much across the board, and as we've talked about before, we have a $900 million to $1 billion profit pool in those emerging markets that's largely unhedged. And so that creates an issue. The second aspect of FX is the Japanese yen. We do hedge the yen and we had a very good rate. In 2013, we hedged about an JPY 80 per $1 rate. Unfortunately, given how rapidly that's deteriorated, the hedge rate we have for 2014 -- I'm sorry, in 2013, we had the JPY 80. In 2014, our hedge rate is about JPY 93 yen per USD 1. So again, well-hedged versus the current rate of JPY 104, but at 17% deterioration from our hedge rate in 2013. So we do see some negative impact related to there. And so then overall, I would say that those are 3 main impacts that account for pretty much all of the impact on gross margin. One additional comment on the directional guidance on calendarization since we talked about FX in those 2 impacts in terms of emerging markets and the yen. As I mentioned, the emerging markets in particular started to deteriorate in the second quarter of last year. So in the first quarter of this year, the year-over-year impact is pretty significant. It's about $0.08 a share of headwind here. The majority of that is coming through the margin line. We have another impact in the second quarter somewhat, but the FX impact, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, is pretty front-end loaded and that's impacting our year-over-year growth for EPS in the first part of the year.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just from a bigger picture standpoint, you had offered a Long-Range Plan in 2012, which you updated at the time of the Gambro transaction. In December, obviously, there have been some changes with respect to austerity and the macroeconomic conditions since that plan was issued. But is it still fair to look at 2014 as a trough year for organic growth and earnings progression as it relates to the Long-Range Plan? I mean, any perspective you could provide on how you're doing relative to your internal expectations and we should think about the long-term picture here.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, David. Bob Parkinson here. Let me tackle that, and then I'll maybe ask Bob Hombach to augment my comments if I miss anything. First of all, kind of starting at a high-level, I mean, clearly, our long-term outlook for Baxter continues to be very positive for a lot of different reasons. When you contrast it with our last investor conference, clearly, there are headwinds that have emerged that are more pronounced than what we had anticipated at the time. I think we continued to talk about global austerity measures and so on as payers around the world struggle with financing access to healthcare and their own budgets and so on, and so not only is that going to continue, it's realistic to think that, that very well could intensify as time moves on. So that's more of a pronounced headwind than I think we anticipated in the fall of '12 when we had our last investor conference. The other thing, and Bob just commented on it earlier, specifically, as it relates to the yen. But currencies in emerging markets are a more pronounced negative. Certainly now, we anticipate that continuing for the foreseeable future. So those are a couple of big changes. Of course, the other operating dynamic that we deal with in '14, you mentioned the trough that is going to continue to be a challenge as we move into '15 is the cyclophosphamide generic, which is a bigger product, significantly so than what it was a couple of years ago. So we're going to have to continue to ride that down. Now on the upside, I would say, when -- at our last investor conference, when we projected long-term top line growth, we did not reflect any new business development beyond that point in time, and subsequent to our investor conference, we've done a number of things and, clearly, are committed to doing that. So to the degree we continue to close BD transactions, that will be an upside to the Long-Range Plan that we last reviewed. The other thing I would say is, we're a lot closer to our new product pipeline. We've talked about that this morning. You're familiar with the specifics. Compared to 2 years ago where there -- I would say, there was a higher risk element, as we sit here today, we have approval for a number of the products, we're closer to approval on others -- other things continue to advance in the pipeline. So I think, in terms of the risk adjustment that we dialed in our new product pipeline as we move closer to these launches, and in some cases, have actually launched products. We have a higher confidence level there. So net-net, how those balance out over 5 years, I mean I think the long-term top line growth for the company is very much in line with what we messaged a couple years ago. We do continue to manage through the trough, as you call it, in 2014. I would caution you though that, not to assume that when January 1, '15 rolls around, the trough is behind us. You got to work your way through it. Cyclophosphamide is probably the biggest piece of that. As you know, we get competitive launches in our hemophilia franchise this year. Although our -- as we've commented before, our long-range outlook for the growth of our hemophilia franchise is very much in line with what we messaged to everyone a couple years ago. So I realize I touched on a number of different pieces. Bob, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that. David, is that helpful?","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That gives a lot more context, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Bob, I think you mentioned, when you chalked up some of the growth in the quarter on hemophilia and how you're looking at 2014, in addition to new products, there's a fair amount of international demand and penetration with the new label. We talked a little bit about this last year in the U.S., prophy and convenience dosing. Can you talk about what may be regionally in terms of health system or clinicians or researchers, looking at the data that put you together for ADVATE in prophy, what the effect has been outside the U.S.? And then I have one follow-up.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I would say, Matt, that particularly in Western Europe, I think the benefits of prophy have been well-understood and there are some kind of top-tier benchmarks in like countries like Sweden that have some of the highest utilization rates as well. But there are other markets where it is under-penetrated, and so the additional approval for ADVATE prophylaxis in Europe allows us to more actively promote that. And so we are seeing benefits both in Europe and, certainly, in the U.S., you've seen the performance be very strong in the U.S. for us here. So there continues to be opportunity to drive that, create greater awareness and increase penetration, because we think at the end of the day, it does improve patient outcomes and quality of life over time. Certainly, having the gold standard product has helped us in a number of markets and, again, we're very pleased with the progress we see in Brazil. And one of the stated objectives of the Brazilian government is to improve access to care and quality of care, which prophylaxis is one of the target aspects of that, that we're working with them very closely on. So again, we think there is much more mileage to be gained here on prophylaxis on a global basis as we go forward.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then on the SG&A line. In terms of the addition of Gambro and then some of the synergies over time around that acquisition, can you give us a sense of when and -- or are we already seeing that line sort of start to show some of the synergies across the acquisition, maybe what the progression, as a percentage of revenues, would look like this year as you get through the integration and synergies.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I would -- well, first off, I would say, as we talked about, there definitely is leverage in the base Baxter business, excluding Gambro and FX. In fact, SG&A year-over-year is flat, excluding Gambro and FX, for Baxter, and that includes absorbing more than $40 million of incremental spend focused on important new product launches, both in 2014 here and in preparation for 2015. So I think we've done a very responsible job in the face of generic competition to drive down our base spending as much as possible while continuing to invest for future growth. Clearly, in the short term, Gambro is adding but, again, at a leveraged rate. We do have a meaningful amount of synergies already baked into our 2014 expectations. As we've talked about, we expect, on a run-rate basis, by the end of 2015 to achieve about 80% of our overall $300 million cost synergies that we expect to have. So we're well down the path and we've baked into our 2014 assumptions here that we make meaningful progress in the first year of synergies, both in SG&A and in margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to turn back to the IVIG markets, and a couple of questions there. Could you give us an update on how the HyQvia launch in Germany is going? Are you able to get the price premium, kind of what you're seeing in the early days there? And then also on HyQ, talk about your ability to supply the market in the U.S., if and when you kind of get the launch there. And then maybe if you could also then comment on IVIG market dynamics as well in terms of pricing and volumes?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. So a couple of things, Derrick. So first, I think the HyQvia launch in Europe is going very well. As we've talked about, we've been very targeted about the markets that we've launched in and have done a very controlled launch to ensure that we get this off to the right start with both patients and treaters, and so the initial feedback has been very good and patient experience has been very good, which is very important to us for the long-term positioning of this product. We are pleased with our ability to, I think, get the innovation we've brought to the market recognized in the price point that we've been able to achieve in some of the markets in Europe, and so we do have a meaningful price premium in those markets today and we expect, as we hope to get approval here by midyear 2014, that we'll be able to do the same in the U.S. In terms of our ability to supply the market, as I mentioned earlier, given our assumption around overall demand growth of about 6% to 8% on a global basis within our existing footprint, we will be able to provide volume unit growth in the 6% to 8% range, both for 2014 and 2015. As you saw though, we have selectively -- given our product constraints, we've selectively targeted which markets we want to participate in for the long run, and so while that's depressed our sales a little bit in the short term, in terms of some of the markets we've exited in Europe as an example, it does position us well to continue to participate in the strong growth in the U.S. market, and certainly, we think HyQvia would provide a significant differentiation for us in the U.S. So we're excited about that opportunity. And we'll be in good position, as our inventory levels have improved in the U.S., to support strong demand going forward for that product. And in terms of overall market dynamics, I don't want to talk about too much here in specifics. But I would say that no real change, strong demand, and again, our ability to supply at-market growth rates is much enhanced here. So we feel good about where we're at for 2014.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Gambro. You talked about the rationale at the start of the -- when you announced the acquisition, around revenue synergies. And I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on when you expect to see those revenue synergies. How they're looking now that you're completing that -- you're in the maintenance of the acquisition and then -- or integration, rather. And then also if you could talk to the sort of the dialyzer constraint issue and sort of where we are on that with respect to Gambro.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, well, as we've talked about this, it took a little bit longer for us to close the transaction as we worked through the regulatory processes. So in the meantime, the business, as you've probably seen, underperformed market growth throughout 2013. But we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity that this represents and the key drivers where we think we will be able to enhance growth going forward, that would be in the dialyzer space, in the acute care CRT space where we have very strong hospital presence on a global basis, as well as stabilizing the in-center monitor business and getting back to more market growth rates in the low-single digits. So in 2013, overall, I'd characterize Gambro's sales growth as, I'd say, a slightly negative low-single digits, if you will. We're expecting to accelerate that in 2014 into low-to-mid single digits within Baxter, as well as enhance our overall PD growth as well because we do think there are synergies on both the Baxter base business as well as the Gambro business as we bring these 2 together, particularly in emerging and developing markets. And so -- sorry...","Mary Kay Ladone","And on dialyzers, Derrick, things are going well there. We did bring up a new line in 2013 to enhance our dialyzer capacity in 2013. Additional capacity will come in -- be coming in '14. We expect about a 50% increase in capacity by the time we get to the end of 2015.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. So I would say early days on generating commercial synergies, but we definitely see the opportunity and have baked some of that into our assumptions here. And we expect that to ramp-up throughout the course of '14 and accelerate beyond that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll try and limit it here to just a couple of questions. So first on Gambro, the $300 million in synergies that you've targeted, it looks like you're actually ahead of our estimates on what you achieve in 2014 with your SG&A mid-single digit guidance and the R&D low-single digit guidance was both lower than we were expecting. So maybe try and just tie the 2. So the $300 million, what do you think that is for 2014?","Robert J. Hombach","I would characterize it as slightly more than $100 million and recognize that, as we've said, a meaningful portion of that comes through the cost of goods sold line. It will take a little bit longer with some of the actions that we need to take there, but a little bit more than half of that, up slightly more than $100 million, coming through margin and the rest coming primarily through SG&A. But I would also say, as you saw through the business optimization activities that we've done as well, we've taken actions on the Baxter side on the expense base as well, again, to get to flat to drive some leverage given the approximately 2% sales outlook that we've got for the base business.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on cyclophosphamide, can you give us what the 2013 revenue contribution was? And can you make an estimate of what you think the EPS contribution was in '13 so we can kind of think about what that looks like with it out of model once we get into '15?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I'd say approximately $400 million, Mike, at very high contribution margins, so a meaningful contribution on...","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So depending on the timing of events here in '14, if we just ignore '14 for a second, view it as a transition for cyclo, the total contribution is somewhere in the $0.45 range?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. It might be a little higher than that. And again, we're thinking about, with multiple entrants coming in over the next 2 years and the normal flow of a generic situation like this, by the end of '15, on a run-rate basis, we expect roughly 85% to 90% of this to be out of our base by then.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to ask about what you guys are doing behind the scenes in front of the Biogen launch. We've all done street surveys, have talked to docs and patients about uptake, and there's a great deal of awareness and desire to switch to longer-acting agents. So in front of the Biogen launch, I'm sure you guys are being very active in talking to your distributors and patients about the benefits of ADVATE and what you have going on in the pipeline, so I just wanted to give you guys the opportunity to talk about what you're doing in the background ahead of this Biogen launch.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, let me -- Glenn, Bob Parkinson. I'm just going to handle that at a high level, but you can rest assured that we're doing a lot of things. I'm not sure I want to specify specifically what those are, so I'm not going to give you any satisfaction in that regard. I would say that we have more time to do those things than what we had anticipated a few months ago, given Biogen's announcement that their launch was going to be delayed. So I think the important thing to recognize is we have more time. We're not sparing any expense or focus to appropriately, first and foremost, promote the merits of ADVATE and -- but beyond that, I don't think it's constructive to get into specific aspects of our marketing program for a number of reasons.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 follow-ups. In the past, you've talked about ADVATE and the new label and the percentage of adoption or sales. Is that continuing to increase?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Glenn, we're seeing both conversions to prophylaxis in general, and then conversions to extending the dosing regimen to every 3 days versus every 2 days. And as we've talked about, hemophilia treatment is very much a person, patient -- personal, patient-by-patient approach here. And we've done some surveys of our own and have shown that a majority of our patients are already doing an alternate regimen from kind of the standard of care of every 2-day dosing for prophylaxis. So a meaningful portion of our patient base is already doing something 3 days or longer from a dosing interval. And so we're going to continue to highlight the strong track record of ADVATE, the very low bleed rates, the very, very low inhibitor rates and continue to enhance our offering from a convenience standpoint in terms of the administration process, as well as continuing to work with patients and treaters to develop tools that allow them to even further personalize. We've talked about a PK dosing tool that we have in development that we are excited about and we think will, again, further enhance our leadership position. So a number of things we're doing here to leverage a very strong label for ADVATE.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just lastly, do you have -- can you share with us your assumption as to potential market share loss in 2014 or 2015 or switching rates that you anticipate? And then I'll jump back into queue.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, no. I don't think it's appropriate for us to get into that. I mean, we've assumed in our guidance basically what's been said publicly, which is roughly a midyear launch. As we've said all along, we think this is a market that will take its time to understand any new product offerings and a very well-educated patient population that's going to understand the treatment trade-offs that they're going to have to consider and so on. We've baked that into our expectation, as Bob mentioned, over the next several years, and over the long run, our long-term view of how this evolve really hasn't changed.","Mary Kay Ladone","And Glenn, I would add, I think in our prepared remarks, we did talk about the fact that although we expect the increased competition, we do have a significant amount of sales related to FEIBA prophylaxis treatment, RIXUBIS, OBI-1, all coming a lot in the back half that'll offset some of the competitive impact that we expect.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two things, I guess. One, product specific and one, a bigger picture. Bob, you talked about VIVIA recently receiving the CE Mark. Maybe just give us a little more detail on the launch plans and market penetration expectations. Just, I mean, you're launching in one country, multiple companies, and the broader 2015 launch, is that throughout Europe? And maybe talk to us a little bit about the slow ramp and just your thinking behind all that. And then I'll ask my other question.","Robert L. Parkinson","Rick, the thinking behind the slower launch is this is a new product and it is a new system and it is a new electromechanical device. It is sophisticated. It is complex. And as a result, we feel that it's prudent to be very controlled and disciplined on the roll out. Our excitement about the long-term potential of this product is every bit as high as it's ever been. The prospects of allowing patients to do hemodialysis in the home nocturnally, significantly increasing the number of hours on therapy, and our belief that advancing important clinical outcomes as a result will be demonstrated over time. So the long-term potential for this product is, we think, tremendously exciting. Having said that, there's no percentage in getting ahead of ourselves on this, and so the comments that I made in my prepared statement about the limited launch in '14 is really about that. It's about being controlled and disciplined and this is kind of a long-term journey but the opportunity is every bit as significant as we've ever felt.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just any granularity on what countries and what kind of institutions that you're going to be launching in the next 6, 12 months?","Robert L. Parkinson","No. I don't want to get into the specifics of that. It's actually -- it's more of on a center-by-center basis. So it will be multiple countries. But obviously, centers that exhibit an interest that we believe can be good partners. There's a big service component to this as well, over and above the product. And so it's really important to select partners in terms of centers that we feel lay the groundwork for, again, kind of a controlled and successful launch.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. Just a follow-up on operating margins. I appreciate there are a ton of moving pieces. Can you help us at all with sort of directional targets the next couple of years? I mean, you've had a sort of a 23-ish percent operating margin for much of the recent history. How long does it take to get back to that level given all the moving pieces? Is it a couple of years? Is this going to be more in the 3- to 5-year kind of timeframe? Any sort of color would be welcome.","Robert J. Hombach","Sure, and I'll speak to kind of the new way we're going to be reporting here, because, obviously, we've provided historical information on what Baxter looks like, excluding intangible amortization, which, again, was all booking to gross margin and having about 120-basis point impact or so on gross margins historically. So when you wash that through and restate the base and look at our operating margin expectations for 2014, they're not that different from where we've been historically, though they'll be a bit below 23% at this point. I would definitely view Q1 -- excuse me, Q4 2013 operating margin as a -- not representative of where we're going. We clearly had some very specific factors impacting Q4 of 2013. Again, just pulling amortization out in and of itself moves it 120 basis points or so. So I would say going forward, if you back out FX at this point, our 2014 operating margin expectation is basically flat to 2013. Despite the fact that we're absorbing cyclo and a number of other headwinds, we'll again have a cyclo headwind next year, but we're going to continue to drive leverage in the business, launch new products with higher margins, drive Gambro synergies and so on, and as we projected in our long-range outlook, that over the next several years, we would expect to generate 200 to 300 additional points of operating margin leverage going forward. That's still our expectation. Again, I think 2015 will be somewhat clouded by cyclo, but beyond that, all those factors I mentioned are going to come into play here and provide leverage for us going forward.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds from Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bob, on the gross margin for the fourth quarter, you definitely had a positive mix from cyclophosphamide in terms of mix price. And recombinant factor VIII, you highlighted Gambro. But to drop 150 basis points x Gambro, of the things that you highlighted, foreign exchange, pension, austerity, LA frac, was any outsized this quarter?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I would highlight the LA-related costs are really non-recurring. So this is really the realization of the downtime and ramp-up back in the second quarter of this year as we were bringing the old LA facility up. As we talked about, that was about a $25-million cost that we thought, and really, a lot of that is impacting the fourth quarter here. And so that's in the neighborhood of 50 basis points or so in and of itself. And there were a couple of small inventory reserves we topped off and FX certainly was a driver there as well.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just one additional quick question. For Brazil, with the Hemobras deal, you said $70 million in 2013?","Robert J. Hombach","That was the incremental, yes.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Did you have any sales in 2012 as a...","Robert J. Hombach","Well yes, we do want to recognize the fact that we had some modest plasma-derived sales. I would say less than $20 million, in that neighborhood. And so obviously, they're converting the market from plasma to recombinant, so we're losing plasma sales and getting recombinant. But we've netted those 2 out in the $70 million incremental.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But there -- in 2012, there was no recombinant sales to Brazil?","Robert J. Hombach","Right. Correct.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

Your lines will remain in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer segment of today's call.","As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Canda. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter 2017 financial results, along with our updated outlook for 2017.","As a reminder, we have posted a supplemental presentation to compliment this morning's discussion. This presentation, along with related non-GAAP reconciliations can be accessed on Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events and Presentations.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development, and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you, Clare, and, good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I will get started with an overview of our third quarter results, then I will share some key highlights for the quarter that reflect Baxter's accelerating momentum around innovation and drive towards sustainable top-quartile performance. I will also briefly address our response to the natural disasters that have recently devastated parts of the Americas and Caribbean, and the related projected impact on our operations in the fourth quarter. Finally, I will pass it over to Jay who'll walk through our third quarter results and financial outlook in more detail. We'll close with Q&A.","As you saw in our press release, Baxter delivered solid third quarter results on both the top and bottom lines. You'll recall that we closed our acquisition of Claris Injectables on July 27, our third quarter performance includes $27 million in sales from Claris.","Sales growth in the quarter was 6% on a reported constant currency and operational basis. Operational sales are adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide, the Claris acquisition, and the previously communicated selected strategic product exits the company is undertaking.","In the third quarter, we realized our strongest growth of the year, driven by continued strength in the U.S., particularly in Fluid Systems, pharmaceuticals, including Claris, and renal therapies. Internationally, we saw improved performance across both the Hospital Products and Renal businesses.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.64 per diluted share, increasing 14% over the prior-year period. This reflected solid top-line growth and improved gross margins driven by favorable mix in the quarter, as well as positive contributions from our ongoing business transformation efforts.","Our company-wide results for the quarter reflect our focus on disciplined execution to drive an improved operational performance. We will continue to implement actions to support our business transformation, while also investing in the businesses, both organically and inorganically to drive innovation and growth.","The Claris acquisition represents an example of this commitment. This acquisition allows us to build a broader presence in the generic injectable pharmaceuticals market. The early market response has been positive, with customers welcoming this addition to the expanding Baxter portfolio. We will continue to build on our momentum and commercial synergies as we launch additional molecules going forward. The molecules being advanced in the generic injectables pipeline represent a combination of internal development and external strategic partnerships.","Our top priority during these early months of integration is to bring Claris fully online with Baxter's systems and processes. We have focus on bringing Claris up to Baxter's global quality standards and have taken actions to support this critical objective. We have made progress since the acquisition closed and we'll maintain this emphasis in the months ahead.","M&A deals like Claris will continue to play an important role in building out our portfolio and pipeline across our key growth categories and adjacencies. Our third quarter highlights also demonstrated transformative and accelerating tempo of innovation of the company. During the quarter, we upgraded the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System with the launch of DeviceVue Advanced Asset Tracking System. Baxter is the first and the only smart infusion pump manufacturer to offer a tagless, end-to-end acid tracking application designed in consultation with our customers to drive operational efficiencies and help maximize the clinical value of their pump investments.","In our chronic Renal business, we have now enrolled the first patient in our U.S. clinical trial for HDx therapy enabled by TheraNova. This is a crucial step in bringing the benefits of TheraNova to patients in the U.S. market. TheraNova technology is designed to closely mimic the natural kidney through clearance of certain molecules during dialysis. It is already available in several markets worldwide, including Colombia, where we have just launched a second trial of the technology.","In acute therapies, we have just launched the first 3-in-1 set for use in continuous renal replacement therapy, CRRT and sepsis management protocols. This is a label expansion for our oXiris blood purification set and adds to Baxter's multi-organ therapy offering, utilizing the Prismaflex system. The oXiris label expansion takes effect in more than 30 countries in Europe, as well as geographies in the Middle East and Africa.","These highlights represent the small fraction of our activity and ongoing investment focus on supporting new products, the indications and new research. These investments are critical for fueling our continued growth hand-in-hand with improved efficiencies, (7:27) and disciplined execution.","Before turning it over to Jay, let me take a moment to address the natural disasters that have overwhelmed parts of the Americas the Caribbean in recent weeks. We mobilized quickly in the aftermath of each of these catastrophes through a combination of product donations, financial assistance, on-the-ground support, and employees going above and beyond to help maintain patient access to our life-sustaining products and therapies. This work continues.","In an update to the press release issued October 12, the FDA has granted two new approvals for regulatory discretion to temporarily import certain drugs from our facility in Canada and Mexico. We now have four sites approved to help address demand in the U.S. market. As it relates to product supply from Puerto Rico, we have targeted recovery strategies in place and are continuing to do everything we can to help mitigate patient and provider disruptions.","As mentioned in the press release, even with the contribution of special import approvals from other sites and expected increased production in Puerto Rico in the weeks ahead, we will not be able to fully bridge the gap in demand in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we currently project that aftermath of Hurricane Maria will negatively impact fourth quarter revenue by approximately $70 million. However, we expect the related effect on adjusted earnings will be offset through positive performance in other areas of the business.","In terms of projected recovery dates, a limited number of products won't return to healthy inventory levels until the first quarter of 2018; however, we currently expect that a number of product families will return to normal supply by the end of this year. We fully understand and regret the hurricane-related inventory impact affecting our customers. Restoring reliable product supply remains our collective priority.","Disruptions like this, in whatever form they may take, are an inevitable part of doing business. What matters is our ability to prepare, move fast, and then react swiftly while maintaining our commitments to our stakeholders. Everyday we're focused on achieving our mission for patients, strengthening our fundamentals as a company, and driving greater value for investors, employees, and the communities where we make a difference. Tenacious execution is the path forward and there's no letting up the pace.","With that, I will pass it to Jay, for a deeper dive on the third quarter performance.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter results, which represented our highest quarterly growth rate for the year. Sales in the quarter increased 6% on a reported constant-currency and an operational basis. Top line growth exceeded our expectations on both the constant-currency and reported basis, driven by better-than-expected contributions from Claris and cyclophosphamide, as well as a favorable foreign exchange benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings were $0.64 per diluted share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.58 to $0.60 per share, and reflects solid top-line performance and improved gross margin, driven by favorable product mix, as well as the ongoing impact from our business transformation efforts. A modest benefit from other income and a lower tax rate also contributed to the results in the quarter.","Now, I'll walk you through performance by business. I'll be speaking to growth figures on an operational basis to provide a clearer understanding of underlying performance. As a reminder, operational growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange, U.S. cyclophosphamide, Claris, and select strategic product exits. I will point out that top line performance in the quarter was not materially impacted by any of the natural disasters experienced during the third quarter.","Global sales for Hospital Products were $1.7 billion, advancing 6% operationally. Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $610 million, up 7% operationally. Performance was primarily driven by robust sales of IV solutions in the U.S.","Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions, or IPS, global sales were $627 million, increasing 8% operationally. Contributing to performance in the quarter were increased sales for premixed injectable drugs and a one-time benefit from an early contract settlement with one of our hospital pharmacy customers outside the U.S. Sales of U.S. Cyclo were $47 million in the quarter and, as mentioned previously, Claris contributed $27 million globally.","Moving to Surgical Care, which includes anesthesia and BioSurgery; total sales were $338 million, increasing 6% operationally, contributing to performance in the quarter with low double-digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by positive demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally, as well as increased U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC, a fast-acting IV beta blocker. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2016, international anesthesia sales were negatively impacted by an austerity adjustment.","Globally, BioSurgery sales increased low-single digits in the quarter. We expect growth in this business to continue to improve as a result of our efforts to enhance commercial effectiveness and reinvigorate the portfolio with a number of new product launches expected next year. Finally, in Hospital Products, sales in our other category were $122 million, declining 2%.","Turning to our Renal business, sales were $1 billion, up 6% operationally. Sales in the quarter benefited from solid performance across all lines of the business. Both our peritoneal and in-center hemodialysis businesses advanced mid-single digits globally. Notably, the in-center HD business reported positive international sales growth for the first time this year, reflecting our efforts to stabilize and improve performance in this business. The Acute Renal business delivered high-single digit growth globally in the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in the U.S. and mid-single digit growth internationally.","Walking through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 45.2% represents an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year and was driven by improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and the benefit from our business transformation efforts aimed at simplifying the portfolio to drive efficiency and reduce costs. This improvement was modestly offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.","Adjusted SG&A totaled $633 million, increasing 4%. The positive contribution from our relentless focus on effectively managing our expense base was offset by lower transition service agreement income from Shire in the quarter. In addition, we continue to make select investments in sales and marketing in key areas of the portfolio to support our growth initiatives.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $150 million increased 16% versus the prior year, reflecting our stated intention to accelerate investments in our core growth businesses.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.3%, an improvement of 30 basis points versus the prior year, and favorable to our expectations, driven primarily by improved gross margin. Net interest expense was $14 million in the third quarter. Adjusted other income totaled $12 million in the quarter, reflecting a benefit from foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions.","The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, which reflects a benefit from the new stock compensation guidance. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.64 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.58 to $0.60 per share, driven by operational sense, other income benefit and a lower tax expense.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $180 million, or approximately 3 million shares. These targeted repurchases were more than offset by option-related dilution. Before turning to our updated outlook, I will provide some commentary regarding our cash flow performance.","On a year-to-date basis, we have generated free cash flow of $933 million, an improvement of more than $500 million versus the prior year, and already exceeding the 2016 full-year total of $905 million. Growth has been driven by strong operational performance and lower capital expenditures, along with continued focus on improving the company's working capital performance.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2017. We expect 2017 full-year sales to increase approximately 4% on a reported basis, and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. And after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, select strategic product exits, and removing the benefit from Claris, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%.","I would like to point out some key assumptions reflected in our full-year sales outlook. These include approximately $70 million of negative sales impact from Hurricane Maria, approximately $57 million in Claris sales, and full-year cyclophosphamide sales of approximately $190 million.","Looking at the sales outlook in more detail, we now expect growth in Hospital Products business of approximately 4% on a constant currency, and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This outlook reflects the full impact of Hurricane Maria, with approximately 80% of the lost sales realized in the IPS franchise. The remainder of the impact is reflected in the full Fluid Systems franchise.","Within Hospital Products franchises we now expect Fluid Systems constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6%, and approximately 7% on an operational basis.","For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions or IPS franchise, we expect constant currency sales growth of 3% to 4%. Operationally, IPS sales are expected to increase approximately 2%. As I just mentioned, IPS includes a negative impact from Hurricane Maria of approximately $55 million.","Within Surgical Care, we continue to expect sales growth of approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% operationally. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we expect BPS and other to increase in low-single digits.","For the Renal business, we continue to expect full-year constant currency sales to increase approximately 3% growth, and growth of approximately 4% operationally.","Moving down the P&L, we expect an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.5% to 16%. We expect net interest expense to total between $55 million and $60 million, and adjusted other income of approximately $35 million for 2017.","For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 18%. For full-year 2017, we anticipated diluted average share count of approximately 555 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2017 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.40 to $2.43 per diluted share. Finally, for the year, we are once again increasing our outlook and now expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1.85 billion, and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion.","Specific to the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% on a reported basis, and approximately 2% on a constant currency basis.","Operationally, sales in the fourth quarter are expected to increase 1% to 2%. I did want to note that operational sales growth includes approximately three points of negative impact due to Hurricane Maria. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.56 to $0.59 per diluted share. This includes a $0.06 negative earnings impact from Hurricane Maria, which is mitigated by an increase in our sales projections for U.S. cyclophosphamide and a lower-than-expected tax rate for the fourth quarter.","With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, the first thing I wanted to clarify is, it seems like when you're talking about your recovery efforts in Puerto Rico that there should be very little spillover into the first quarter. Is that right in terms of what you're currently projecting? And what's the risk that some of these efforts take a little bit longer to kind of shore up your supply?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Matt, good morning. We have three factories in Puerto Rico. And I think our lowest percentage of operating capacity right now is at probably around 70% to 80%, okay? So, we will have very little impact in the first quarter. We're going to have on-hand inventory of those products towards the end of January, meaning on-hand, I mean product in the inventory that can be shipped. So nothing that we know today would prevent us from having inventory position be well-positioned by the end of January.","That doesn't mean that you're not selling the product, meaning that we have a pretty good inventory levels at that moment in time. So, I will say the impact in the first quarter is small. But I want to make sure that people understand that the infrastructure in Puerto Rico is devastated. So we are operating under emergency situation with generators, and we have water in our plants and everything else. So the plants are fully operational, but we need to make sure the federal government continues to provide the support for the recovery of the island. We have one of the plants already going on to the grid, hopefully by the end of this week.","So, as we continue to see progress, our confidence becomes even stronger. But based on what we know today, very little impact in the first quarter.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, Joe, thanks for that. And then, I wanted to ask one on the Renal business. If I look at the guidance for the year, it looks like you're projecting a little bit of a pick-up in the fourth quarter, and this is the first quarter the HD business has grown in a while. Can you talk about what you're expecting going forward, and if we could see more of a pick-up, I guess, in the HD business, with you participating in tenders, or what's going on there?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, we are expecting low single digits in the HD business. But one thing that we have done is, we anniversary some issues that we had in dialyzers on a global basis, primarily outside the U.S., where we encountered significant competition and price erosion that has been anniversaried, but also, we're the second largest manufacturer of dialyzers in the world, so we have the ability to compete very effectively outside the U.S., and I think this is one of the changes in mindset from the old Baxter to the new Baxter. You operate where you can and make sure that manufacturing is a strategic weapon for the company.","So, when we look at the market, we can provide the market with the great products outside the U.S., in a very cost-effective manner and also profitably. So, we want to make sure that we participate. You know previously here in the company we probably did not have that window into the opportunity. So what you're seeing right now is the pick-up of our dialyzer business outside the U.S. markets and the stabilization of our monitor sales, as well. So, we feel cautiously optimistic and happy with the turnaround in the HD business.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great, Joe. Thanks for the color.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks very much. First, just a clarifying question. I'm sorry if I missed this, but, Jay, in terms of the EPS impact of currency in 2017, can you tell us what the impact is in 2017, and your thoughts on how currency is shaping up as we look forward?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, as we think about the second half of the year relative to forecast, while we have seen a fairly meaningful sales improvement relative to foreign exchange, the actual drop-through has been fairly low. So, maybe a penny or two on the bottom-line. And I bet \u2013 I would characterize that as a result of a couple of things. One is, given that a lot of this strength comes from Euro strength, we have a very large European cost base in place. So, we don't see a great benefit from the translation back of dollars of increasing Euro performance.","Now, we are working on our European cost base, and that will improve over time, but, the benefit of a stronger Euro is a bit muted. The other factor that comes into play when we think about foreign exchange is we have had \u2013 we have put on hedge positions over the last six quarters, hedging out Euro and other currencies, and so, we have a little bit of an offset. As the Euro strengthens, our translation improves, but that's offset a little bit by lower gains in terms of foreign exchange on the hedge positions that we have.","So, in combination, I would say that while we did see a sales impact, we didn't see an intended drop-through to the bottom line, for the most part. And looking out to 2018, clearly there is some currency strength that we're evaluating that could have an impact, but there are a lot of different factors in play as we look to 2018.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That was very thorough. Thanks, Jay. And then, Joe, just I was wondering if we can get an update on your latest thoughts on capital allocation? And specifically, how you're thinking about the growing free cash flow and cash that you have? If deals do not materialize, are larger buybacks what we can expect as the most likely use of cash? Or are there circumstances where you'd let cash build? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Bob, we always prefer to invest the money back into the company. In this case, the cash flow of the company into acquisitions. When it is not possible, we're going to buy shares back, okay? But I want to make sure there is not an exclusivity to my statement, meaning that those are not mutually exclusive. We will do both of them because I think our cash position and our ambitions in terms of targets, we can do both, buy shares and continue to pursue M&As. I would say that large acquisitions are very difficult to combine, and the return-on-invested capital that they bring along is marginal.","So, we are focusing on molecule purchasing. We have a lot of those in process right now, tuck-ins, product lines from companies are divesting, things such as this to augment our growth in the long-term, and augment our four pillars of growth in our business, which is the pharmaceutical business, the critical care, the surgical, as well as parts of our renal area, primarily areas that will be beneficial to us outside the U.S. in terms of buying clinics and things like that.","So, if we find acquisitions in these areas where we're going to execute and we have a brand-new M&A team and we see some really good momentum there. But, it is not exclusively one or the other. Be sure that we will continue to apply our cash flow, our growing cash flow to share buyback and to deliver value to our shareholders. I would say maximized value for our shareholders.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Very clear. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I want to try and run through a couple of items. So, first, in the quarter, what was your ability to capitalize on B. Braun's manufacturing challenges in the Solutions business? And then, could you just spend another minute on the IPS out-performance this quarter going into, obviously a more challenging fourth quarter because of the hurricane? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Mike, I would say that one thing that we have changed at Baxter is our view of supply chain. And this has changed significantly in the last six months. And the reason is that we not only now are preparing to come into the U.S. with significant volume in LVPs to help assure our current customers that they will have LVPs.","So, we do have that capability coming from other plants in the Americas, and that has already advanced to a point that we're going to start seeing that volume coming into secure volume and help guarantee volume for our current customers in the first quarter of 2018. But, also, volume that will serve to consistently meet the necessities of customers that are not ours in a situation like B. Braun.","So, we are selling every LVP that we have today. I know the situation in the U.S. is not desirable from the point of view of the providers with the current \u2013 the competitor that you just mentioned having quality issues or supply issues. I don't know which one is what, but I know that we are doing everything we can. But in the future, to be able to capitalize on this, we are bringing significant volume into the U.S., now that it has been redirected permanently, permanently from other parts of the world to the U.S. in a very cost-effective manner and also it is approved by the agency.","In terms of the fourth quarter, I think Jay was clear about the upside that we have in cyclophosphamide, as we don't see a third competitor or fourth competitor coming to that market, so, we'll be able to offset the Hurricane Maria impact. But once you clear that impact, we also are making provisions so we can have enough SVPs.","So, let me clarify what SVP is. It's small volume parenterals, and that's the product made in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico does not make one-liter bags, does not make 500-mL neither 250-mL bags. Okay? So, separate both of them. I think there's some misinformation going around, spread by other competitors about what makes what and who makes what.","So, we want to make sure that people know. We also are augmenting volume and production of SVPs coming out of Puerto Rico to be able to satisfy not only current customers, future customers. So, we see the Solutions business in the U.S. as a good business; therefore, we made some permanent decisions in allocation of capacity back into the U.S. to augment current contracts and future contracts.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just to clarify, there was a piece in the IPS Business internationally this quarter that you said was one-time. Could you just maybe explain what that was, and how much it was? And then, Jay, just a tax rate question, you're guiding to a lower tax rate, initially it was after the fourth quarter at 18%, can you just speak to the sustainability of that in 2018? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","So, Mike, what happened was, that was a one-time contract \u2013 contractual payment due to us outside the U.S. in a compounding pharmacy area, and there was $20 million this quarter. Okay?","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","That's what we highlighted, we're not going to repeat, but was a contractual paid to us. And I'll pass it on to Jay to answer the second part of your question.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, certainly. The tax rate has trended favorably relative to our expectations. In the third quarter relative to out-performance, tax rate contributed about a penny. And then, again, in the fourth quarter, we're seeing some positive performance from tax rate.","The biggest driver of this relates to FAS 123-R, which is the new stock compensation guidance. At this point, it's difficult to forecast the long-term impact of that, because to a large extent, it's dictated by auctions exercise and the nature of those auctions, in terms of their value relative to what's anticipated by the Black-Scholes model. So, it's hard to say what the tax rate impact will be in 2018 based on these items, but we're certainly pleased with the performance that we've seen in 2017 related to this item.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Joe, I wanted to follow-up on one of Mike's questions on Fluid Systems. Our sense at our conference was increased enthusiasm for the ability to add capacity in the back half of this year to provide more capacity to customers next year. And you mentioned this could be a tailwind through the first quarter. Could this actually turn out to be relative to some of the destruction when your competitors, a tailwind longer, or have a longer duration into 2018 than just the first quarter?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","David, I think we don't know the extent of other people's problems, and unlike other competitors, we will not speculate what their problems are. But, what we can say is what we are preparing to do. We are preparing to bring to the U.S. a strong volume of LVPs in the first quarter. It's starting in the first quarter, coming from one of our factories in the Americas that is approved to ship into the U.S. already. And that will not only help secure volume for our current customers, but also open our ability to compete for secured volume for other customers, which currently are not our customers.","So, I'm not saying that we're going to be able to do it. I'm saying that we have the opportunity in front of us. And knowing our Baxter U.S. team, led by Scott Luce, I would say that I have full confidence that team can deliver on the opportunities.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe just two quick follow-ups. So, Joe, obviously last quarter you provided an LRP, and a general association of growth for sort of 4 percentage growth for the LRP. Can you just give us a sense kind of roughly, Is that a good proxy for how we should think about 2018 growth rates?","And then for Jay, just on Claris, I mean you're pretty confident at our conference around this. But the warning letter sort of came out here intra-quarter, more details of that letter. Are you comfortable with sort of where you are from a mediation perspective on Claris? And do you forecast any additional costs that we may not know about heading into 2018? Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","David, what we said in July about the LRP has not changed. But we would like not today to provide guidance into 2018. So, we will be tuning first week of February, we'll tell you all about 2018. But today, I think we should focus on the third quarter of this year, which we finished, and the quarter coming up, which we're currently on the fourth quarter of 2017.","Let me comment on the first part of the question of Claris, and I think Jay can talk about the cost, if there's something to add. We have already responded and are on schedule to deliver on every promise we made to the agency to address their concerns on every observation. So, to summarize, we are on the good path of addressing, from our perspective, the issues that have been raised by the agency. Okay?","We knew some of those issues ahead of time. And we already had plans, before we closed this deal, that we're going to put Baxter quality systems in place. We had no doubt about that. We are doing everything we can accelerating the pace to put those in place. We feel that the value of the acquisition is still very much on target, and the value proposition has not changed, which is quality, low cost, and availability of product.","And I think the amount of the resources that we have deployed to Claris to resolve these issues and improve their quality systems has been second to none. Baxter does a great job in mobilizing and addressing a crisis, and they did a pretty good job. So now we feel very comfortable that everything that we're doing, we're seeing the effect and we've seen the effect in a positive manner.","Remember I speak from our behalf, not on behalf for the agency.","Second thing, the amount of money that is going to be used to remediate the quality issues that we have, that we already had most of this cost predicted, we don't think at this point in time, I'll pass on to Jay, there will be something of large extent. Because, first, we know some of them are not expensive to fix. It's just procedural things that we have to do, but I will pass it on to Jay if he has anything else to add.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Really not much. I mean, we have no material changes to our financial cost projections for the business. I think Joe summed up the situation very well.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the growth strategy. First, just kind of looking internally; not a lot of attention on the call today regarding Claris, in terms of the pipeline. Can you maybe just give us an update on kind of where you stand, bringing some new products to market. As I recall, it was more of a 2019-2020 story, but just looking for an update on how we should think about the contribution to organic growth?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Innovation is picking-up momentum at the company. I would say that bringing Sumant on board was a big victory for us, and he's starting to make a big difference in how we see innovation. I would say it is playing 19-20 is more of a play there.","But we're making everything we can today. Actually, just look at our R&D spending. It was a little up on a sequential basis, and the reason for that is, we're going after some more clinical trials, something the company has shied away in the past of doing. So we're going more after clinical trials, like TheraNova. We have clinical trials in a couple of different places. We are spending more money in our infusion systems.","As you know, we have a new version to be submitted to the agency and then to be released hopefully next year, of our spectrum, SIGMA Spectrum. We have new platforms coming up in 2020. We have our new CRRT machine coming to the U.S. in 2019. We have new filtration systems going in for different types of toxins. Going to be launched in 2019 and 2020.","So we have the momentum going. I think the biggest challenge that we have is to make sure that we balance the spending in R&D with the spending in the infrastructure of R&D. So, as we continue to modernize and bring the right people to the company to help cement this innovation, we don't get ahead of ourselves in creating more R&D centers, which we're not going to do. As a matter of fact, we're going to reduce the amount of spending in infrastructure and increase the spending in product development.","So, we just want to keep transparency and give you, on a quarterly basis, an update of some of our advancements in innovation, which is the next thing for Baxter to be successful, is to combine the significant transformation of the business costs with the innovation, to deliver the best benefit for our shareholders.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on the inorganic side for growth. You mentioned earlier that large transactions are difficult and, of course, the overall environment for asset prices continues to go up. So, I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which your strategy for M&A is evolving, and in particular, sort of the opportunities that you see maybe outside the U.S. that are perhaps less obvious to those of us in the U.S. market? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","M&A follows a strategy. We don't have an M&A strategy per se. We have a strategy for every business of the company. And M&A is following that. In the past, we had those two not very well coupled and now we do. Our strategy for the company is expansion inorganically, not only in the U.S., but across all regions. In Europe, as well as Asia with focus in China.","And we have the people being put in place to be able to scout those opportunities. We have an M&A team that is focused in bringing more deals. I'm seeing more deals now in the pipeline than I have seen before, but not deals that are \u2013 more relevant deals. Deals that have higher probability to be executed in a very large and very fast, by the way, process going on in our pharmaceutical groups, our pharmaceutical group led by Bob, Robert Felicelli. Now, it's time to accelerate and we have identified a significant amount of opportunities in their group for growth. So, inorganically, by the way.","And so, now I feel a bit more comfortable that we have the right structure and the right strategy for the company to execute on inorganic opportunities.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Isaac.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Miksic of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a terrific quarter. So, I wanted, Joe, maybe just first to follow-up on that last comment. You've made a few comments on strategic investment perhaps preferring kind of tuck-in smaller molecules, as you've talked about.","And I'd love to understand, you know, there's clearly opportunities in your \u2013 across your operating structure to sort of drive leverage, Claris and molecules is one, and your specialty injectable platform. Surgical call-points is another. And on the Hospital side, on the Surgery side for product lines or things like that, I'd just love to get a sense of which elements of Baxter's infrastructure, operations, call points, sales force, I don't know, distribution, adjacencies, do you see as opportunities to leverage?","Because I assume if you're looking at product lines, that's one of the key elements of the opportunities. And I have one follow-up.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Our call points go from Hospital to Home. In the Hospital side, we have, in the U.S. and large geographies around the globe, a very good, I would say, probably one of the best key account management groups in the industry.","So, our ability to put things in contract, private label products, primarily drugs for GPOs, becomes a real strength when you're looking at these small molecules and how you bring them online. So, look at Claris. With Claris benefited from Scott Luce's opportunities in the U.S. Scott runs our business in the U.S. sales for the Hospital business and immediately got some accretion going on with the Claris molecules in the U.S. So, that is a sweet spot for us.","We will shy away, at least in the beginning, to go into spaces that you have to create a brand new sales force with no synergies because the value of those acquisitions are quite dilutive to begin with.","Then you look at the Home. We have a sales force to call on home in our Renal business, our PD business, with significant penetration in the U.S. So, the ability to put more on their bag is important to us, and is also an opportunity. So, the call points in Surgery, for instance, we have \u2013 we are in the ORs, but we need to find the sweet spot in the ORs with our sales reps can be relevant.","So, we're not going to look into generic instrumentation and laparoscopy stuff because those things the market is saturated with that. There are companies that own that space and we have no value there. But we add value to niche operations, niche spaces of therapies or procedures that we can probably have our sales force scanned it back. So, we will see some movement in terms of inorganic opportunities in the future that capitalize on our sales force and the hospital surgery-wise, where we put more products in their bags and they will probably do a great job on that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Joe, emerging markets account for about 20% of your sales, but they don't get a lot of attention on these calls, and the growth has been sluggish, I think, in the first half of the year in emerging markets for your business. What was growth like this quarter in emerging markets? And what's the outlook there? And I had a follow-up. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Larry, just want to clarify. What is called emerging markets is 23% for Baxter. So, you can see Baxter different than other companies, that are called peers, have a pretty high penetration in those markets. Most of the products we sell in emerging markets are not devices, per se, they are renal and they are fluids, okay? So, when we look at market growth rates, and you said sluggish in the first half, we were just growing in market rates for the markets we compete. We had a pretty strong third quarter with, for instance, China at 7%, okay? That was a pretty good market growth for us. We do have depressed numbers in emerging markets because it's the place we exited the most of our IP business.","So, places like Turkey, like a reduction in volumes in the Middle East, Venezuela, parts of Latin America, as well as parts of Greece, that we took volume down. India, we got out of 100% of Fluids business in India. That's where you see a depressed number.","When you remove those, you still are pretty good, strong underlying. So, having a 7% growth in China, it is a great growth for us, because in China we are in peritoneal dialysis, nutrition, and IV fluids and anesthesia gases, okay? So, these are the businesses we have there. We do a great job. We have market share leadership in almost everything we participate in China and China is completely \u2013 is going through a complete transformation where we're going to bring more value-added fluids to the market instead of just your regular dextrose and saline. So, I feel really strong about China in our LRP crossing the billion-dollar mark, which I think is a challenge, but is going to be a doable \u2013 doable challenge to the Chinese team.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Joe, just to clarify. So, when the business exits, and this year we should see an improvement in your emerging market growth rate, it sounds like. And then just one for Jay. You know, year-to-date growth is about 5%. You did 6% in Q3 operational growth, it looks like adjusting for the $70 million from Puerto Rico. It's about 4% in Q4, and that's off of a little bit of an easier comp year-over-year, I believe. So, maybe if you could help us just kind of bridge Q3 to Q4, what do you expect to decelerate a little bit, that would be helpful? Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Certainly. The primary driver, as you noted, of the sales deceleration in the fourth quarter relates to the $70 million impact from Hurricane Maria. But beyond that, as we think about comparison Q3 to Q4, as Joe mentioned in his answer to a question, we did have about $20 million related to a contract buyout, which we don't anticipate repeating in the fourth quarter. That was more of a one-time item, per se, or a specific to the third quarter, I should say, item.","And so, if you adjust for that the growth rate essentially comes down a point. We had anticipated that. It was no surprise, but it was part of the forecast that we put together. So, what I would say, generally, is we \u2013 when we guided in July of this year, we said overall the business is a 4% grower from 2017 to 2020. In many cases, there are quarterly fluctuations. The first quarter was above that rate, the second quarter was below, the third quarter was above, and the fourth quarter we expect to be in line, but for the Hurricane Maria impact.","So, I think largely we're growing a little bit faster than our end markets. And then what we do is we go through a bottoms-up forecast process and isolate things like austerity measure impacts and one-time buyouts, and so on, and put together the forecast. So, really, that's the essential commentary, I think, thinking about the fourth quarter, but no material change in trends, per se. Continue to grow in line with our long-term expectations.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Certainly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, I just wanted to ask about the impact of the Renal business from the Fresenius-NxStage deal. How do you think that changes the competitive dynamics, and does that change Baxter's overall view of home hemodialysis?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","I think the market dynamics will not change in the long term. Okay? I believe that the leadership positions that we have today become the same going forward three, four years out when you think about innovations that we are bringing to the marketplace in PD with point of care, and also the CRRT business with us launching our new Prismax platform in the U.S., as well as extracorporeal stuff that we're going to be launching in the U.S.","So, I would say that, I can't comment on why people do things. They are not related to Baxter. So I'm not making a judgment on why one company bought another one. I just don't see the reason why that would affect our market in the short and long term, primarily because, to date, we have market share leadership in CRRT, and we're not letting up on innovation. And in PD, the same thing.","So, we want to make sure that our investors understand that we have a very strong pipeline going forward, and the acquisition or the merger of these two companies are quite immaterial to us at the moment, the way we see it.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And just sticking to renal, I was hoping you could talk about how to think about the drivers of the Renal business in 2018. Not asking for guidance, but you're continuing to roll out AMIA. You will anniversary some of these less favorable tender exits. So, just wondering, do you view 2018 as a growth acceleration year, or do we really have to wait for the on demand PD system in 2019 before we see the Renal business pick up? Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","I just want to start with the end. I will not \u2013 I want our investors to understand that the POC, point of care is not a driver of our business, neither is something that will transform the business and change the growth rate of the business in any way, shape, or form. Remember, we are the market share leaders in PD around the globe. And so, for that purpose, the growth rates of the market are primarily dictated by the growth of the disease and our growth.","So, I would say that you will continue to see a growth in patients. The patient growth has been healthy for us, and we think we'll continue to become healthier as we move forward. And the HD negative tenders that we either did not participate or had a significant price impact, we will anniversary.","So, the Renal business is in good shape, and we will save some of the news for 2018 for February when we give guidance.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's fair. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Joe, so, maybe this is getting a little bit in the weeds. But I'm very curious about this Sepsis opportunity that you sort of started to talk about and some of the clinical trialing going on. Could you just shed a little bit of light on sort of the way to think about either the opportunity or the timeline here? And then I had one quick one for Jay.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Larry, what we find is, extracorporeal technology has evolved, and our know-how in membranes and filtration systems help us get there faster. So, if you combine the fact that a patient who is in continues renal replacement therapy in an ICU, will have the probability of developing multi-organ failure. Starting with the kidneys and you go to lung, liver. We are developing filtration systems or membranes specifically for that.","So the Sepsis one is, there are some toxins that our oXiris product will filter. And is successful in Japan, which is making this changes and creating the momentum across the globe, all the way coming to the U.S. We have a lung product that we currently distribute today, which is very effective. We also have MARS. Which is used \u2013 I was at Emory University the other day, and extensively used there for treatment of liver toxins. And is used in conjunction with our current CRRT product, which is in the market, Prismaflex, today. So, we really like that space.","We have a new general manager for this business on a global basis. As a matter of fact, I'm going to see some revised plans this week in terms of how to expand this technology a little faster and a little deeper into markets. But we're excited about those extracorporeal technologies using the current technology that we have for CRRT, but also banking on Prismax, which is the new platform coming out today \u2013 coming out in the U.S., probably sometime in 2019.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then, Jay, just quickly. Obviously, working capital improvements have been a big opportunity for you guys. So just, again, remind us where you've been making the improvements in working capital, and just any thoughts on opportunities as you look forward?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. Really, working capital and I would say, generally speaking, cash flow performance has been a core area of focus of the entire organization. And I think we're really pleased with the progress.","On the working capital front, frankly, it's been all three areas that have been squarely in our focus. Inventory management, days payable, and DSO. And in the third quarter, we had good performance across all three. I think the quarter ends with days payable of 49, days sales outstanding of approximately 55 days, and inventory on hand in the 90's.","Now, certainly, we want to make sure we have adequate inventory on hand and, I think with the hurricanes and so on, that number may be a little bit low relative to standard levels. So, we'll look to rebuild the days inventory on hand. But overall, very pleased with the progress. We have initiatives across each of those three areas, along with a clear focus on CapEx with a zero-based budgeting process for CapEx. And it's just nice to see them all paying dividends.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","James K.

As a reminder this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Stephanie. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Jay Saccaro, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Bohaboy, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. On the call this afternoon we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter financial results and outlook for the remainder of 2015 before taking your questions.","I'd like to take a moment to highlight that our second quarter results are inclusive of the BioScience business as the official spinoff of Baxalta occurred subsequent to the close of the quarter on July 1. Going forward, the financial outlook and results for Baxter will be reported on a standalone basis excluding the BioScience business. On the call today we will focus the discussion on the performance of new Baxter, as Baxalta will host a conference call tomorrow to provide additional highlights on their performance in the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year. We plan to post standalone new Baxter financial schedules for the quarterly periods of 2014 and the first half of 2015 to our investor relations website prior to our third quarter earnings release to enable year-over-year comparison.","So with that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this afternoon and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Clare. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today's call is a transitional event for Baxter. It comes on the heels of our successful spinoff of Baxalta. The excitement level continues to build with the new Baxter as we embark on our journey as a standalone entity and begin to implement a number of the new strategic initiatives and margin improvement actions that will accelerate our profitable growth in the years ahead.","For the second quarter, Baxter delivered a strong performance with adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share, exceeding our previous earnings guidance of $0.92 to $0.96 per diluted share. Worldwide sales also exceeded our guidance, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis, and after adjusting for the impact of increased U.S. competition for cyclophosphamide, sales advanced 4%.","Certainly our biggest milestone for both the quarter and the year was the successful completion of the BioScience spinoff, resulting in the establishment of two leading global healthcare companies. The smooth transition that we've seen following the spin is a credit to the comprehensive planning and disciplined execution carried out by employees and leaders across both businesses. And our strong second quarter results provide both Baxter and Baxalta with positive momentum as we continue our commitment to enhance value for all of our stakeholders.","As we laid out at our Investor Conference in May, accelerating profitable growth is critical to Baxter's future success and is an objective that the entire management team is focused on. We are not only striving to meet our profit growth goals, but frankly, we're aiming to exceed them. Rebasing our cost structure, optimizing the existing portfolio, and launching numerous high-value differentiated products are the three focus areas that we will execute against over the long-range plan to drive the financial goals that we provided in May. Many of these initiatives have been launched and are gaining traction.","So with this as a backdrop, I'd like to highlight some of our recent achievements. First, addressing our standalone cost structure is crucial to meet our goal of increasing earnings at a rate meaningfully faster than sales growth, and we're making progress on a number of fronts. The Gambro integration program continues to advance. We're on track to capture $100 million of cost synergies in 2015, and as we exit the year, we'll have successfully achieved two-thirds of our $300 million 2017 cost synergy target. And more broadly, a comprehensive cost rebasing plan for Baxter is now under way, and we're executing on key opportunities to reduce structural costs and increase efficiencies across the global enterprise. Now that the spin's complete, we've started to implement a number of substantive measures and look forward to sharing more information on these initiatives as we progress.","With respect to portfolio management, during the quarter we took steps to optimize our global supply of IV solutions to address demand, while also improving profitability. In May we received FDA approval establishing our Sabi\u00f1\u00e1nigo, Spain, facility as an approved manufacturing site for saline for the U.S. market. The FDA is also in the process of reviewing our application to source saline from our manufacturing site in Cuernavaca, Mexico. As all of you are aware, saline has been listed in Drug Shortage Database as maintained by the FDA over the past two years. So introducing a new supply from Spain and potentially Mexico to the U.S. market will provide us greater flexibility to respond to market demand. It also reflects our commitment to ensuring that we are optimizing our global supply and allocating or reallocating products to markets that generate enhanced returns aligned with our margin improvement goals.","Finally, I want to share some recent highlights from our new product pipeline. As you heard, the leadership team emphasize at our Investor Conference, innovation is Baxter's lifeblood and fundamental to sustained growth. We have an exceptional pipeline that's well balanced among highly advanced new products, meaningful improvements to our existing offerings, and expanding our portfolio into new geographies. All are focused on improving the quality of care, while addressing key areas of medical need.","So some recent milestones include, in our hospital products business, the full-scale launch of the next generation SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump is now under way in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. And I'm pleased to report that demand is strong. The Spectrum platform has been honored with the best in class customer satisfaction award for four consecutive years, and the latest generation pump includes several innovative features, including an enhanced master drug library, which helps to reduce pump-related adverse drug events and improve patient safety. Customer response has been very positive, and the SIGMA Spectrum is currently being used or in the process of being placed in six of the top seven hospital systems in the United States as ranked by the U.S. News & World Report.","In our renal business, we initiated the launch of our AK98 in-center hemodialysis monitor in several markets in Eastern and Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The AK series is our flagship in-center HD monitor, and this latest version offers advantages in usability and reliability while reducing the total cost of operation.","In the U.S. we completed a 510(k) submission with the FDA for AMIA, our next-generation peritoneal dialysis cycler now integrated with our SHARESOURCE web-based connectivity platform. AMIA incorporates user-friendly features like a graphical touchscreen interface along with secure two-way connectivity that lets healthcare providers mobilely monitor treatment and adjust prescriptions as necessary.","And finally, I'm also excited to share that the FDA has approved Baxter's investigational device exemption for our VIVIA home-based hemodialysis system. This milestone helps clear the way for the final U.S. study. And as we've previously shared, the VIVIA technology has the potential to transform home hemodialysis and allow more patients to benefit from high-dose HD in their homes.","These are just a few of the new products that we'll bring to market over the next several years. Our pipeline is well-positioned to make a meaningful impact on both near and longer-term performance, and I look forward to providing more details on the progress and potential of this pipeline going forward.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jay for a discussion of our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year, and then I'd like to make some closing comments before then opening up the call to Q&A. Jay, please.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings in the second quarter of $1 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.92 to $0.96 per share. GAAP earnings of $0.60 per diluted share included net after-tax special items totaling $218 million or $0.40 per diluted share primarily for costs associated with the company's planned separation as well as business development initiatives and intangible asset amortization. These charges were partially offset by a benefit related to a legal settlement.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for the third quarter and second half of 2015. Starting with sales, worldwide revenues of approximately $3.9 billion declined 6% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3% which compares favorably to our guidance for the quarter of approximately 1%. Excluding the impact of increased competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide, Baxter's sales advanced 4% globally.","Medical Products sales were in line with our expectations while strong growth across the BioScience portfolio contributed to the overachievement. Sales in the U.S. increased 1% or 5% after adjusting for cyclophosphamide. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 4%.","In terms of individual business performance, within Medical Products, global sales of approximately $2.5 billion declined 9% and on a constant currency basis, sales were comparable to the prior year period. Adjusting both periods for the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide, Medical Products sales rose 3% on a constant currency basis.","Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $949 million, reflecting a decline of 9% on a reported basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency sales increased 3%. Performance in the quarter was driven by mid to high single digit growth in our peritoneal dialysis business and double digit growth in the acute business. This growth was offset by lower sales in our chronic hemodialysis business resulting from our previously mentioned decision to forego certain lower margin sales opportunities as well as the impact from increased austerity measures in Western Europe.","Within the fluid systems franchise, sales of $518 million declined 3% and on a constant currency basis sales advanced 3%. Performance was driven by the relaunch of the SIGMA Spectrum pump in the U.S. during the quarter and strong demand and favorable pricing for IV fluids.","Sales in the integrated pharmacy solutions franchise totaled $548 million and declined 16%. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 8% as strength in our hospital pharmacy compounding service business was offset by lower cyclophosphamide sales in the U.S. Excluding this impact, sales in the category advanced 1%. This growth was somewhat dampened given the tough year over year comparison as growth in the second quarter of 2014 was the highest quarterly growth for the year as product availability improved for certain nutritional products that had previously been supply constrained.","Revenues in surgical care, which includes our inhaled and aesthetics and biosurgery products were $333 million in the quarter and declined 4%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 4% driven by strong performance globally in the anesthesia business and solid growth of our core surgical sealants and hemostasis products including our market leading flow seal hemostatic matrix. This performance was partially offset by lower sales of select non-core bio surgery products.","Finally, sales in the biopharma solutions and other category, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $116 million, declining 6% on a reported basis. Sales increased 2% on a constant currency basis driven by increased international demand from our contract manufacturing partners.","Global BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter and declined 2% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, BioScience sales advanced 7%. Additional details on the BioScience performance in the quarter will be available on the Baxalta earnings conference call tomorrow morning.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 50.7% compared to 50.3% last year. Positive mix, select pricing improvements, and foreign currency hedge gains more than offset the impact from increased generic competition for cyclophosphamide and incremental manufacturing investments made in the quarter.","SG&A totaled $951 million and was comparable to prior-year levels. On a constant currency basis, SG&A increased high single digits. Growth in the quarter reflect continued investments in promotional and market activities to support new product launches in BioScience, certain costs incurred to establish the regional commercial organizations for Baxalta, and adjustments to bad debt reserves in emerging markets.","R&D spending in the quarter of $292 million increased 1%. On a constant currency basis, R&D advanced mid-teens and was driven primarily by increased investments in the BioScience business.","Interest expense was $30 million in the second quarter compared to $42 million last year as we benefited from a favorable rate and debt mix, and higher capitalized interest. Our second quarter ending debt balance included approximately $5 billion of debt issued by Baxalta in June, which upon the spin has moved to their balance sheet, as well as the retirement of $1.1 billion of commercial paper. Subsequent to the second quarter, we successfully tendered for $2.7 billion of outstanding bonds. Both the commercial paper reduction and bond tenders were paid down with proceeds from the $4 billion cash dividend that Baxter received from Baxalta in June.","Other income totaled $15 million and included planned gains related to the sale of select equity investments. The tax rate of 23.2% for the quarter was slightly above expectations driven by the one-time impact associated with completing select tax audits, primarily outside the United States. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our full-year sales guidance and outlook for both the third quarter and second half of the year. But before I do that, many of you have inquired about restated historical quarterly income statements. We do plan to post adjusted non-GAAP financial statements to our website prior to our third quarter earnings call to provide investors with historical baseline financials for new Baxter. This timing allows for the completion of the final carve-out process and associated discontinued operations presentation of the BioScience business, as well as the confirmation of the baseline run rate associated with the transition services agreements we have set up with Baxalta for which billing will commence in the third quarter.","Now, turning to our guidance and starting with sales, on a constant currency basis we continue to expect sales for the full year 2015 for new Baxter to be comparable to 2014, primarily due to the impact of generic cyclophosphamide. Adjusting both periods for this cyclophosphamide impact, underlying growth is approximately 3%.","By franchise, we continue to expect renal sales to increase approximately 3% and surgical care sales to advance 4% to 5%. For fluid systems, we expect sales growth of approximately 3%. We now expect sales in the integrated pharmacy solutions franchise to decline mid-single digits. As you know, this category includes cyclophosphamide. For 2015, we now estimate U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of $190 million to $200 million. This is an increase from our previous guidance and reflects a benefit of approximately $20 million in the second quarter and an incremental $20 million to $30 million benefit in the second half of the year relative to our original guidance. While we continue to expect additional competitors to enter the market, the timing of these entries remains uncertain. Growth for the category after adjusting for cyclophosphamide is expected to increase mid-single digits.","And finally, we expect the other category which includes our biopharma solutions franchise to decline approximately 10%, as a major customer elects to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter.","Moving to the second half of 2015, our outlook remains consistent with the guidance we provided at our Investor Conference in May. We expect second half sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency to be comparable to the prior year, and after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide, to increase approximately 3%. At current foreign exchange rates we expect reported sales to decline approximately 9%.","We anticipate the gross margin for new Baxter to be approximately 42% and we continue to expect an operating margin of approximately 9%. As previously mentioned, the 9% initial operating margin reflects the impact of stranded costs and incremental pension expenses following the spinoff of Baxalta. It also incorporates investments we've made to enhance our manufacturing and quality systems.","For the second half, we expect interest expense to total approximately $70 million as the benefit of our reduced debt levels is more than offset by lower levels of capitalized interest. We expect other income of approximately $15 million, reflecting a benefit from the sale of select equity investments in the back half of the year.","Given the geographic mix of our earnings for new Baxter, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20%, and for the balance of the year we expect an average share count of approximately 550 million shares. As stated in our press release, we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.58 to $0.62 per diluted share.","Specific to the third quarter, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency to be comparable to the prior year, and after adjusting for cyclophosphamide, to increase approximately 3%. At current foreign exchange rates we expect reported sales to decline approximately 9%, and we expect earnings from continuing operations excluding special items of $0.29 to $0.31 per diluted share.","Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Bob for some closing comments.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jay. As part of our roadshow efforts following the May Investor Conference, we had the opportunity to meet with a significant number of both current and also potential investors. Given that this today is really the first public forum that we've had since the Investor Conference, I wanted to take just a moment to address and expand upon three key topics that emerged during many of the meetings. The first topic relates to our margin profile. The second relates to our plans for capital allocation and the last topic centers on management succession.","So starting with our margin profile, I can tell you the confidence that we have in the margin expansion targets we provided in May has only been enhanced in the subsequent weeks. Momentum is building across the organization, and as some of our recent highlights suggest, we're already making progress on a number of our margin improvement initiatives. Enhancing profitability is the top priority for new Baxter, and while our short-term profitability is impacted by certain discrete factors, we know what these are and will be addressing them along with our broader cost structure in the months ahead.","The spinoff of Baxalta has provided us an opportunity to clearly evaluate our entire cost structure, and we're committed to aggressively addressing our cost position to ensure that it's aligned with our new business profile. We've demonstrated that we can achieve these targets as we've been successful in executing against the cost reduction initiatives identified as part of the Gambro acquisition, and as mentioned, are on pace to achieve our $300 million target by 2017.","And to be clear, the margin targets that we presented in May are not an end state. Both Jay and I emphasized in our prepared comments at the Investor Conference that we expect margin expansion to continue well beyond 2020. As we progress, we'll continue to look for additional actions to not only accelerate profitability but drive overall margin improvement beyond the targets identified.","Turning to capital allocation, and in particular, our use of the retained Baxalta equity stake. The decision to retain the stake affords us the opportunity to restructure our balance sheet in a highly tax-efficient manner. As we've shared previously, we intend to use the proceeds of the stake to further reduce debt, repurchase Baxter shares and to make a contribution to the domestic pension plan pending regulatory approval. Over the next 18 months, we'll leverage a combination of these activities to arrive at an optimal mix that maximizes the value to Baxter and our shareholders while minimizing the fees and other execution costs resulting from these activities. By reducing debt, we will create capacity for additional borrowing as appropriate to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities while remaining within our targeted leverage ratios.","As you may have seen this afternoon, we declared our first dividend as a standalone company. The payout ratio is in line with the target that we shared in May of approximately 35% of adjusted net income and places us at the high end of our peer set. Going forward, we expect to grow our dividend distribution commensurate with earnings growth, and we remain committed to returning meaningful value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Regarding M&A, while it's not included in our initial financial projections going forward, we do expect M&A to be a key component of our strategy to accelerate profitable growth. In the near term, our M&A activities will be somewhat constrained by both organizational and financial capacity. Over the next 12 months, however, as we enhance our balance sheet and progress on our post-spin margin improvement initiatives, we'll have significant flexibility to take full advantage of opportunities that are aligned with our business model and augment our channel strength and geographic presence.","The last topic I wanted to address this afternoon and expand upon relates to the subject of succession planning. Given my tenure as CEO, which now is well over 11 years, and my age, this was a very natural question that arose in most of the road show meetings. When I came forward to the board over a year ago to recommend that we consider the spinoff of BioScience, the board discussed succession planning and concluded that an undertaking of this magnitude would be enhanced by my continued involvement throughout, to maintain stability within the organization, ensure that the timetable of the spinoff and all associated activities were achieved, and set the stage in the best possible way for both companies to be successful.","At that time, I committed to the board that I would agree to serve as CEO of new Baxter long enough to ensure that our goals were clearly defined, that the entire organization was aligned with what we needed to accomplish and that our progress toward our goals and our confidence in attaining them if not exceeding those goals was evident. While the board naturally is always working to ensure a plan of succession, with the spinoff successfully completed, the board is again actively taking up the subject of my succession, and as part of that process has formed a working group of the board to manage the search process and has retained a search firm to assist in this regard. The board knows that I'm available as support in the succession process in every way and I'm willing to serve in whatever capacity the board feels will provide value. While a specific timetable has not been established, we did want to take advantage of this opportunity to update you on the topic, and of course we'll share information as appropriate going forward.","So in closing, this is truly a new day at Baxter. The road ahead offers significant opportunities, and we have the strategies in place to leverage these opportunities to deliver enhanced value for all of our stakeholders. The recent spinoff creates the potential for us to have an even greater impact on the lives of our patients as we accelerate performance globally. We're already making it happen along the key trajectories that I've outlined here. Yet through it all, we're staying true to the same fundamentals that have made us a recognized and trusted global market leader for over 80 years: innovation, quality, efficiency, market access and improved clinical outcomes for patients worldwide.","So with that, I think we can now open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Can you hear me okay?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We can, Bob. Go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. So I just want to take the opportunity, Bob, to follow up on your comment about succession and your comment about you want to wait until progress is evident. Is it reasonable to assume that by early 2016, we're going to know what kind of progress or that progress would be evident? I'm just trying to put some timeframes around your commentary around succession.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I appreciate the follow-up question, Bob, and again I don't want to be specific in terms of dates. The reason I did mention what I did is it's fair to characterize this to say what I would call a front burner issue with the board. I mean, the fact of the matter is our board has had in place through the governance committee an established succession plan process for a long time. And in fact, just to provide a little color for everyone, we had discussions on this going back over the last few years. But clearly as we approach the spinoff, we kind of took the notion of succession and set it up on the shelf a little bit.","I will say the decision to spin off BioScience clearly wasn't a result of any succession planning, but the reality is as a result of the spinoff, it did answer the succession question for that big piece of the business. It also allows the board to go forward now and evaluate succession in the context of a medical products\/medical device company which in terms of experience and so on, can be a much more focused search I think. So now, given the fact that the spin has taken place, recognizing the progress and the momentum that's building at new Baxter, as I said, this has now become a new priority.","And as I said in my prepared comments, with that, the board has formed a working group to manage the process, retained a search firm. I don't want to get into all the specifics of that including timing other than to say I wouldn't have raised it in this sense if now that the spin has been completed, we've got renewed enthusiasm, energy and focus and alignment behind what we want to do at new BAX and now is appropriate for the board to reengage on this and that's why I wanted to comment on this this afternoon.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. So I think I'm hearing, what I think I'm hearing from you, it doesn't sound unreasonable that something could happen in 2016 just kind of hearing the things that you just mentioned.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. That's not unreasonable at all.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's not unreasonable at all. The fact of the matter is, we retained a search firm shortly after the spin. We didn't do it before then because there's no secrets in the world. Stability in this organization is important and we intentionally, as I said, kind of put that on the shelf until the spin was completed. But shortly thereafter we formalized it, and particularly with our employees, I always try to be forthright and transparent in communications and that's another reason why I wanted to communicate it today, so they have some expectation in that regard.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just one really quick one for Jay. Given your back half guidance, can you just give us a sense as to the revenue contribution from cyclo in the back half and then the total debt of new Baxter in the back half that drives that interest expense number you mentioned? Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, certainly. As far as cyclo in the second half of the year, we currently expect approximately $70 million in the second half of the year which is a slight increase over our prior guidance. And then as far as the new Baxter debt balance in the second half of the year, we completed a debt tender successfully as I commented on in my prepared remarks. At this stage, we're not reflecting any utilization of the retained stake beyond that. But overall from a debt standpoint, post-spin we're anticipating approximately $6.3 billion in debt, which reflects the benefit of utilizing the cash from the cash dividend from Baxalta to retire certain debt and commercial paper. So that's the current expectation.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to ask a question I guess about the overall guidance and any thoughts you have on margins. I mean specifically on the guidance, you gave a second half number. Can you put that in context in terms of what that implies for earnings power for the year? And then also, talk about some of the levers that you have year-over-year and whether there's been any change to your thoughts on margin expectations for next year?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would say our margin expectations for the second half of the year, first let's start with that, are very consistent with what we shared in the Investor Conference. So the 9% operating margin reflects our expectation around start point, and there are a number of factors that are impacting that 9%. As we move forward, we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our long-term margin projections. Having said that, I don't think it's appropriate at this stage to modify our target for next year. As you know, we expect 100 basis points of improvement relative to the second half. So 10% margin for next year and that would include approximately 100 basis points of negative drag from cyclo. So really the organic improvement would be approximately 200 basis points relative to the second half of this year.","As it relates to the full year comparables and the earnings power, given the complexities of a mid-year split, we're really not in a position at this stage to comment on new Baxter as a standalone enterprise. We reported Q2 as a consolidated enterprise. We expect later in the year as we approach the Q3 earnings call, we'll have the ability to report Baxalta not only from a discontinued operations basis, but also at that stage reflect the transition service agreements and the actual consumption of transition services by Baxalta. We'll start billing for that, those services that we provide next month. So from an overall standpoint, the first half of the year really is a Baxter consolidated view until we modify that later in the year.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matt, this is Bob. Maybe just to add some higher-level color. It's really too early subsequent to the Investor Conference for us to modify either our outlook for this year or next year. But I think probably as you gathered from our commentary in our prepared remarks, we increasingly are confident in our ability to achieve what we disclosed to everybody and what we project at the Investor Conference. I think the momentum is building and just to reiterate our aspiration, if we can do better, we're totally committed to do that over the next five years in the LRP and certainly subsequent to 2020. So good momentum building, but it's too early in the game to, I think to modify any of our financial projections.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot for the color.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good afternoon everybody.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Dave.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Jay. Hey, Bob. I wanted just to start with a couple questions just on the business. If you look at very specifically I guess the fluid systems franchise, it looks like in the U.S. that business continues to do a little bit better than one might expect your end markets to be growing at right now. Can you just sort of talk about the key drivers underpinning the strength in the U.S. and to what extent these type of growth rates are sustainable?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well just maybe high-level comment, then I can maybe tee it up for Jay for more specifics. Some of the strength that you're seeing demonstrated is really a result of some pricing power, pricing latitude in the U.S.. The underlying volume is I think pretty consistent with what we've been generating. As you now, it's a fairly low growth market on a volume basis but what you're seeing the strength from is really, in the core solutions business is really pricing, but then of course we're starting to pick up momentum more broadly with the relaunch of the SIGMA Spectrum.","And I will tell you, again, and you know this, Dave, but for the others that are calling in, we projected in the long range plan to recover 5 of the 10 share point loss within the LRP. And early days with orders we have in hand and what we expect this year, I would anticipate that we're going to get at least 1 share point of 5 back before the end of the year. So that's part of the momentum that's building there and that's contributing to the strength as well. Jay, I don't know if there's any.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, nothing to add.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Specifics you want to add to that. Those are the key components, David.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. Then maybe turning just to the surgical care franchise. That's a business that looks like it's maybe doing a little bit better but obviously an area that is fairly intense on the pricing competition side. Do you think this is a business that we can see accelerate on a go-forward basis, particularly as sort of evidence continues to come through on better U.S. hospital volumes and surgical volumes, or just a franchise that's sort of permanently constrained to sort of a lower single digit growth rate?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So two different pieces here and again I'll ask Jay and Clare and Scott to add commentary as appropriate. For the biosurgery, what historically we've classified as the biosurgery business, two different stories: a fairly mature market in the U.S. and growing with surgical procedures with some additional penetration. The opportunity for growth longer term is clearly O-U.S. and that's an area of additional promotional investment and focus going forward. The anesthesia business continues to perform quite well. The adoption of inhalation anesthetic agents in emerging and developing markets continues to grow. As you know, we have the only full line of inhalation gases and Suprane continues to perform very well. So the anesthesia business is a little different than the biosurgery business, if you will, not constituting our surgical care franchise. But I think realistically the kind of growth that we projected at the Investor Conference in the range of 4% to 5% at this point continues to be a prudent expectation. I wouldn't increase expectations beyond that at this stage. And guys, you want to add anything to that?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. That's good answers.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just Jay, a quick question on the Baxalta stake. I know you talked about the balance sheet moves here in the back half of the year. But obviously a lot of what you've talked about implies you sell a material portion of the Baxalta stake before the end of 2016. So, are there any special dynamics underpinning the timing of that sale process? Meaning should we expect it to be more immediate post the spin or closer to the end of 2016? And then I have a quick follow-up.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah David, if you think about our objectives with the Baxalta stake, it's really to maximize the value of the stake to Baxter. And as part of that, we're going to look to carefully evaluate the different levers that we have and be opportunistic in terms of timing and amounts in each. And so I wouldn't say specifically there is a specific time that we're targeting. We're probably not going to do anything in the first 60 days, allow the Baxalta stock price to stabilize and we would probably not wait until we get too close to the 18 month timeframe because as you know there are very significant tax benefits to achieving our objectives within the 18 month timeframe.","Beyond that, we expect to start certain transactions this year and then we'll do a number of other transactions next year, but we haven't reflected the benefit in reduced share count or reduced interest expense for late-year transactions that we're currently contemplating. The key inputs as we think about this, with respect to the pension, we're going to carefully evaluate the prevailing interest rate environment because we don't want to oversize the pension contribution depending on the size of that liability.","We're going to carefully evaluate the evolution of the Baxalta stock price and then the receptivity to, the anticipated receptivity from Baxter debtholders and Baxter shareholders to the different tactics that we're pursuing. So those are some of the key inputs that we're evaluating as we look at timing and sizing of the different transactions. At this stage I wouldn't expect one very large transaction but more multiple transactions.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful color, Jay. And then, Bob, I just want to come back to renal for a second here. I feel like it's sort of a tale of two cities. You have great enthusiasm around CRRT and some positive secular tailwinds and you have the more traditional HD business which is perhaps a little sluggish. So, what assumptions are you making for price erosion in the traditional HD business? You talked about some of those in this quarter. How much of this is coming from true austerity, how much is coming from direct decisions you're making about mix, and how much is just coming from frankly competitors using price as a weapon in the channel? Thanks.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably some of each. Thanks for the question, Dave. And I'll play it back in and I'll ask the team to contribute as appropriate. It's kind of a tale of three cities, maybe. One is the acute piece in the hospital, which continues to grow very nicely, double digits and higher margin. And we continue to increase our focus on that. The traditional in-center hemodialysis business, which I'll come back to in a second, and then the third leg of courses is peritoneal dialysis which continues to be an attractive growth vehicle and also an area that has pricing latitude going for it as well.","So the area that I think used the word sluggish is probably a fair way to describe the traditional in-center hemo business, although I would say that having the full product line, we're seeing that manifest itself in helping us on the PD business as well. So I think increasingly going forward, we have to look at this business in its totality. So on a constant currency basis it grew 3% in the third quarter. As you know we're projecting the long-term growth to be in the 5% to 6% range and that will be driven over time by capacity expansions later in 2016 with dialyzer expansion and then augmented by PD capacity expansion largely in Asia subsequent to that. And then augmenting that of course are the new products which we're very excited about.","So let me come back then to the traditional in-center piece. It is a combination of things. We are being more discerning relative to the profitability of that business. I think we commented in the first quarter about some tenders that, candidly, we walked away from because of the returns. It is a price competitive business, and we have assumed, in answer to your question specifically, price erosion for that segment over the LRP on the very low single digits, but I think a practical recognition of the continued competitive nature of that.","And then there are austerity measures, one of which was recently implemented in France, where as a matter of policy, they've said we want to extend the useful life of monitors from seven years to 10 years. So that obviously has an impact on revenue of monitors, and I would emphasize, our profitability on monitors is at the low end, and whether it's an old monitor or a new monitor, they chew up the same number of dialyzers, and frankly it reduces our CapEx to some degree as well. So net-net, I'm not sure on the bottom line how significant that is, but it is a contributing factor to the top line. So I touched on a number of things there. I think I've answered each of your specific questions. I'll stop there. Does that address your questions, David?","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, Bob. Very helpful. Thank you.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So, Jay, a quick one first. The FX hedges you mentioned on the gross margin line, how much did they contribute in the quarter? And then, Bob, I just want to follow up Bob Hopkins' discussion with you on succession. So it sounded like a few weeks ago, let's call it late June, you were talking about the dialogue with the board being, you need to get the spin and new Baxter, if you would, off on the right foot, and you wanted to see that through. But it sounds like now what you're saying is, it's more likely that a new CEO is on board at some point in 2016. Just want to make sure we're hearing that correctly. Thanks.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I said it was possible that a new CEO could be on board in 2016. The reality is, I think there has been benefit and will continue to be benefit by my continued involvement post-spin for a lot of different reasons. But the reality is, the progress we're making, I think that the focus and the momentum and the alignment behind what we need to do is really good. And I'm going to be 65 in January, and I've been around almost 111\/2 years and so inevitably this has to be dealt with. So I think actually the stage is set very nicely for the board now to do what they have a primary responsibility of doing, is to revisit the issue of succession now that the spin has been successfully executed and transition and succession has been defined for Baxalta, now to focus on the Baxter piece. So I think that we can achieve the objective of stability post-spin. I intentionally didn't define a specific date, but I did respond to Bob's question in the fashion that you reiterated, and I think that's fair. So I think it's a good plan where all objectives can be effectively met.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then Jay.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Mike, yeah, on your gross margin hedge question, we did have the benefit of $25 million of hedges in the second quarter on the gross margin line.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wow. Okay. And then maybe just one follow-up. And this is, Jay, probably for you. One of the discussions coming out of the analyst meeting on new Baxter is the spread or disconnect, if you would, between the net income and free cash flow. I think you guys guided to basically what amounted to about $1.40 in cash earnings, depending on what the share count is next year, and the timing of some of what you do with Baxalta. And that compares to free cash flow of $400 million, which would be about $0.75, $0.80. And so, can you just talk a little bit about that quote-unquote \"disconnect\" or that spread, and then how you think about that narrowing, if you would, over the next several years? Thanks.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great. So the primary driver of the spread between operating income or cash earnings and free cash flow relates to, in the short term, CapEx. As you know, Mike, our business is capital intensive. A lot of that has to do with the fact that we're in the IV and PD business, and those have a higher capital burn. In addition to that, in the near term, we've announced a number of important capacity expansion projects that start to benefit sales in 2016. The three major projects that we have ongoing that we'll complete in 2016, we have a China PD expansion, we have a Thai PD expansion and we have the Opelika dialyzer capacity expansion.","All of these are revenue generating. All of these generate positive economics for Baxter, but they do have the impact in the near term of depressing free cash flow relative to operating income. Over time, as we migrate and improve the operating margin of the business, we will hold CapEx flat or even as I said in the Investor Conference, we'll see a decline in CapEx, and so the relationship between free cash flow and operating income becomes much more normalized.","Mike, but having said all of this, I want to emphasize that the entire management team is very much focused on free cash flow generation, and while we have a plan on CapEx, we are extremely focused on every single capital project to ensure that those dollars are dollars that create economic value for the company. So that's a little background color and some further information for you.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's good. Thank you, Jay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Bob, just a follow-up on a question from earlier regarding the sales outlook. I mean this was obviously a very strong sales growth quarter, so I was hoping you could help me better understand \u2013 I guess, I should say very strong, better than expected. So I was hoping you could help me better understand the sort of near to medium term. I mean, actually let me ask it medium to longer term headwinds that make you think that you can't grow faster than that sort of long term 4% sales growth target that you put out at the analyst meeting.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, actually \u2013 thanks for the question, Danielle. I mean, we need to pick up the pace a little bit right now to get to the 4%. We were at 3% for the quarter. So we know the primary driver for that will be with the capacity expansions in renal, both dialyzers and PD capacity, as well as momentum with the SIGMA Spectrum relaunch and the other new products. To get ahead of ourselves, first of all, if you adjust \u2013 if you go back to the 4% CAGR that we talked about over the LRP at the Investor Conference, adjusting for cyclophosphamide, that's actually closer to 5%. So that means you're really growing from a current run rate of 3% up to 5%.","And the other point that I would reiterate is as part of our margin improvement program and really addressing the product portfolio, we are going to aggressively evaluate certain product categories in certain geographies which may result in us exiting those product lines in certain geographies which obviously has a depressing effect on the top line as well. So we do have some momentum implicit in our long-term projections. But we wanted to also reflect the fact that we are going to be proactively addressing portfolio in a way that may result to some decreases in revenue, not unlike the tender position we took in the first quarter on hemodialysis monitors.","So I think overall it's balanced. I think our long range sales projection in the LRP is very achievable. Adjusting for cyclophosphamide, I think it's pretty stable and fairly predictable and again of course it doesn't reflect anything and therefore, not only M&A obviously, but any further business development as well. So I think, Danielle, it's a pretty balanced forecast both for the rest of the year, 2016 and throughout the LRP.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just to follow up on your comment on business development, M&A, given the fact that the board is actively now searching for your successor, is it fair to assume that nothing major will happen on the business development side until a new CEO is in place? Or are you still actively looking to do things for the rest of your tenure?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, we're continuously looking at deals. Our, kind of other than Gambro, our historical MO of doing kind of bolt-on deals and so on, we certainly, we conceivably can do over the next 12 months. But as a practical matter, we have financial constraints. So the notion of a transformational deal is interesting and we can talk about it in a hypothetical context, but as a practical matter in the short term, we don't have the financial wherewithal to do anything in the short-term. And if that's the case, then to speculate one way or the other, telegraph intent ahead of time doesn't seem to serve any stakeholder's interest effectively.","The Gambro deal I think represents the fact that we're willing to think bigger if the value is there. And whether it's me or a successor, I think there's an open-mindedness to that, but again right now today, it's not a practical option just due to constraints, right, financial constraints. Not to mention, I would say organizationally we're still completing the Gambro integration. This company has been consumed over the last 12 months as a result of the spinoff, which has been the number one priority, and appropriately so, because I believe we'll look back and realize that that decision will have generated significant value for all stakeholders and all shareholders for both companies. Now that that's done, we refocus our attention on other priorities. And, but I think a transformational deal in the next, say, 12 months or something, it just isn't in the offing because we don't have the financial latitude to do it.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks so much","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Stephanie, this is Clare. We have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to Gambro, and just better understanding on what's changed on the sales growth forecast, because it seems like you're hitting the metrics from a cost synergies perspective, but the sales growth outlook seems to be very different. It was one that was, at least at the time of acquisition, supposed to accelerate the overall growth profile of Baxter as a whole. And obviously with them there, the Medical Products business and here we are talking about the HD business only growing 2% to 3% over the long range plan. That was certainly not something that was my impression that was going to be the growth forecast for Gambro at the time of the deal. So what's really changed about that business or the market that's really leading that Gambro, or maybe just the market, to be a lot slower now versus just only a couple years ago? Bob or Jay.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Kristin, thanks for the questions. So let me start at a high level, okay. I'm really glad that we did the Gambro deal. Things always change in big acquisitions, but looking back now a year-and-a-half on or thereabouts, almost two years on now, I'm really glad we did the deal. Things always turn out differently than what you anticipate. And you're absolutely right. The core \u2013 and it's really a follow-on to commentary I made earlier. I don't know if it was David Lewis or David Roman's question, I can't recall, in terms of the traditional in-center hemo business, okay. Because that has fallen behind what our expectations are, so your commentary in that regard is spot on. I would agree with that. But if you take a step back and look at the total deal, first of all, much of the value of the deal, more so than typically in acquisitions, was based upon the cost reduction. And as we've commented today, we're well on track to achieve \u2013 frankly it's not \u2013 slightly exceed that $300 million target, so that's really positive.","In terms of the higher growth higher margin business, the in-center CRRT, that's moving along totally in accordance with our expectation. The other thing that has been favorable, and I think going forward increasingly you have to look at our renal performance in aggregate. Part of the rationale was to complete the full product line, thereby enabling us to participate in commercial opportunities where previously perhaps we didn't, because we didn't have all the clubs in our bag so to speak in the traditional in-center piece. And so the commercial synergies that we're getting, particularly on PD and so on, have certainly achieved if not exceeded our expectation.","The piece that has been slower is the traditional in-center piece. Part of it is market driven and part of it is organizationally driven. I think the integration of the commercial organizations has been more challenging than what we anticipated bringing the Gambro and the Baxter pieces together, including change out of leader \u2013 most of this business as you know is outside the U.S., so it's a byproduct of 50 general managers around the world and making sure the right leaders are in the right place in each market. And so the sorting out process in that regard has been somewhat more challenging than we had anticipated in the modeling.","And secondarily, as we've converted from distributors to going direct, which is our mode of doing business as you know, while we fully anticipated that as a result of the due diligence, there have been some challenges associated with converting from distributors largely in emerging developing markets in ways that we didn't anticipate (58:35). So it's been slower than we anticipated. That was operationally related.","Then in terms of the marketplace, frankly in terms of the pricing, it's performing pretty much in accordance with what we modeled. We anticipate in the acquisition analysis that this was and would continue to be pricing competitive. We didn't anticipate perhaps some of the austerity measures. I cited just one recently in France. And then the other piece of it is we have been consistent with our overall priority at new BAX going forward, more discerning and more demanding in terms of returns through our new mindset of new Baxter, and that's had an impact in terms of some of the profitability. So I touched on a lot of it, but I really \u2013 maybe I'll just end where I started, Kristen, which is I'm very pleased that we did the deal for a lot of different reasons and confident that the value clearly is going to be generated over the long term.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And there's no update on the home hemodialysis timelines for the U.S. relative to the -","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I had \u2013 Clare, make sure I don't misspeak.","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Obviously we announced, we said that we've filed. The FDA accepted the investigational device exemption so that allows us to start the U.S. trial which we continue to expect that will begin before the end of the year with filing likely sometime in the 2017 timeframe and a launch in 2018 consistent with what we shared at the Investor Conference in May.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then for Jay, just in terms of the Baxalta stakes, sorry if I missed this. Can you comment on just how the split will be in terms of how much will go towards the U.S. pension? I think it was about $1 billion. And how much will go towards paying down debt or how much will just go towards acquisitions and whatnot or just will become cash on the balance sheet? And I think there was something in one of the filings that mentioned a potential stock exchange as well.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So, Kristen, there's really three uses for the retained stake, pension, a stock for stock exchange or split off as it's termed and a stock for debt exchange which essentially amounts to a secondary offering coupled with a debt buyback. So those are the three vehicles that we're currently evaluating, each of them to the extent that we pursue them within an 18 month window, are tax-free uses of the stake.","So what we've said is we expect a 50 basis point benefit from contributions to the pension which would imply approximately a $600 million contribution to the pension. But frankly, the sizing of that ultimate contribution will very much depend upon the prevailing interest rate environment. We don't want to go well north of 100% funded status. As we sit today, we're at roughly 80%, and so this would close a portion of that gap but it wouldn't close all the gap. To the extent that interest rates rise between now and year-end when we would contemplate a transaction of this nature, we're going to watch that very carefully.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","As it relates to the other two pieces, it really is going to depend upon our ability to execute those transactions with the least amount of cost. Because to the extent that we over delever, we always have the opportunity to lever back up to buy shares or to pursue M&A. The important thing is we want to use the retained stake with the limited, the least amount of economic loss to Baxter, so that we're going to be very thoughtful about transaction costs and premiums and things of that nature.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot. Just wanted a quick question on the operating margin front. Can you talk about the operating margin baseline and trajectories for the four business units relative to the corporate margins? Or is there one or two units that has more depressed margins where you can give us some more specifics or granularity on how the margin turnaround can be achieved?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We really haven't disclosed margins by segment or area except to say that there are certain businesses that carry a higher margin than the Baxter average, and those businesses include the CRRT business, our surgical care business, our nutrition business within integrated pharmacy systems. Those are a few of the businesses which carry a higher margin than the corporate average. In the case of those businesses, our full expectation is to grow them as fast as we can with promotional investments to support that. By doing that, we expect to see a positive benefit on the margin.","There are other categories of businesses which we would characterize as having lower margins. And what we've said is, it's really not a global question to ask, but it's more specific than that. In certain products in certain geographies we have margins that are below our corporate target. With respect to those businesses, our expectations are we're either going to fix, shrink or exit those businesses over time. So we have a very disciplined framework in place, but it's a more fine-tuned methodology than a global methodology with businesses that have lower margins or higher margins. Because frankly in some businesses that may have a lower margin in one market, that margin may be dramatically different in another market depending on the nature of the dynamic.","Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And just on that portfolio optimization point that you brought up, can you talk about the pace of product pruning or exiting suboptimal geographies? You've already started in renal. It sounds like you do have strategic plans in place, but is this going to depend on balancing this portfolio optimization and then loss of revenues and how that flows down to the bottom line?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so we've completed the portfolio analysis. We have clear line of sight to the fully loaded profitability and the economic returns of our businesses. But before we exit a business, our first expectation is that our general managers will attempt to fix it, and that takes some time in certain instances. So the pace at which we do this will really be gated by how successful we are in turning around some of these businesses or not. And to the extent that we're not, we will make very clear and definitive decisions about exit, but only after we've given the opportunity to the operations team to actually fix that business. Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All I would say is, but that's not going to be a protracted period of time.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There will be a sense of urgency on this. But there is a disciplined process, as Jay described, Josh.","Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Robert L.

Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman","Thanks, Canda. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's fourth quarter 2017 financial results, along with our financial outlook for 2018.","As a reminder, we have posted a supplemental presentation to compliment this morning's discussion. This presentation, along with the related non-GAAP reconciliations can be accessed on Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events and Presentations.","As previously mentioned, we've reorganized our commercial structure to boost performance, optimize cost, increased speed in the decision making process and drive improved accountability across Baxter. To that end, we will be modifying how we report our quarterly financial sales in segment analysis. This new structure will reflect the current makeup of our commercial operations, and while we recognize these changes will impact their model, we believe this presentation will provide you with more granularity regarding our topline performance by global business units end reason [ph].

Joe?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I will start with a brief look at our fourth quarter performance, then I will share some thoughts on 2017 as a whole and how we are well positioned to sustain this momentum into 2018 and beyond. Jay will then take us closer look at our 2017 financials and outlook for 2018. We'll close with Q&A.","Baxter finished the year with another solid quarter delivering fourth quarter sales growth of 5% on a reported basis, 3% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally. Operational sales adjust with an impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide, the Claris acquisition and the previously communicated select strategic product exits the company has undertaken. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $0.64 upto 1% year-over-year driven by strong operational performance, the ongoing impact of our business transformation efforts in a lower tax rate. This performance more than offset the impact in the quarter from Hurricane Maria which reduced our results by approximately $70 million on top line and approximately $0.06 on the bottom line.","For full year 2017, Baxter achieved top line growth of 4% on a reported constant currency basis and 5% operationally. Adjusted income from continuing operations up $2.48 per diluted share, an increase of 27% and free cash flow of more than $1.2 billion.","Before we discuss some key highlights for 2017, I wanted to take a moment to update you on our operations in Puerto Rico. We've been intently focused on addressing the supply situation in U.S. and the aftermath of the hurricane and the challenging impact it has had on our customers. Our primary goal as always is to ensure we can address the needs of patients and healthcare providers and we have mobilized quarterly [ph]. All of our Puerto Rico facilities are now connected to the electrical grid and we've been ramping up production to pre-hurricane levels. Our expectation is that we will be able to return to more normal supply levels over the coming weeks and as such we expect the residual sales impact of approximately $25 million in the first quarter of 2018.","In a related matter as you are likely aware, an aggressive flu season in U.S. coupled with industry-wide supply changes has heightened demand for Baxter's large volume IV solutions which we produce outside of Puerto Rico. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we have received further FDA approval to import large volume IV solutions from our plant in Cuernavaca, Mexico to help address increased demands from our customers and potentially served new customers in the future.","Now turning to some 2017 highlights. Claris acquisition represents an important example of our commitment to enhancing our portfolio and pipeline in our core growth businesses like generic injectable pharmaceuticals. We are rapidly integrating the Claris team, bringing these operations fully online with Baxter's quality systems and looking forward to continued momentum and commercial growth over the long-term. And earlier this year we announced an agreement to acquire two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt, RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK; both compelling for post additions to our advanced surgical portfolio.","From an R&D perspective, we enter into some promising partnerships designed to augment our portfolio and potentially lead to transformative patient care technologies, our organic R&D pipeline is also advancing the several high potential developments. In the U.S. market we received FDA guidance clarifying the regulatory pathway for new home-based peritoneal dialysis or PD, solution generation system that may allow even more patients to experience the benefits of home therapy. And we have initiated the U.S. clinical trials of HDx therapy enabled by TheraNova; a Baxter technology now available in many global markets that is designed to closely mimic the natural clearance of certain molecules during dialysis.","Outside the U.S. we begin to limited launch of PrisMAX, our latest technology advanced for acute care therapies in Europe. We anticipate full European launch later this year, also in acute therapies we launched a labeled expansion for oXIRIS, blood purification set in selected markets outside the U.S. This marks the first three-in-one set for use in continuous renal replacement therapies or CRRT and sepsis management protocols. We continue to advance customer focus enhancements with high value technologies across our core portfolio, including our AK 98 hemodialysis system, our FLOSEAL and TISSEEL Hemostatic agents and the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion system. In 2017 also marked a one million PD treatment used in our proprietary share source telemedicine technology, shared source is foundational rather to the success of our newest automated PD cyclers, AMIA in the U.S. and HomeChoice CLARIA in international markets.","Last week we announced FDA approval of Bivalirudin used Baxter's proprietary frozen GALAXY container technology, making it the first and only presentation of this generic cardiovascular inject with a convenient source and premixed solution. These internal and external investments designed to accelerate future growth are balanced along with our commitment to return significant value to our shareholders. Through this end in 2017 we increased our annual dividend rate by 23% but also repurchasing more than $560 million worth of shares.","Overall, we are energized by what we accomplished for our stakeholders in 2017 and it has all been made possible by our 47,000 employees globally who are absolutely committed to our mission and the success of our transformation. As we look to our expectations for 2018, increased operational efficiency remains essential and we will continue to identify opportunity to improve operating leverage, at the same time we intensely focus on accelerating top line performance. We know by enhancing our product mix we can drive sustainable gross margin improvement for the company. As schedule [ph] continue to ramp up, our emphasis on new product innovation and business development support this objective. We look forward to updating you on this strategic initiatives, particularly many of our existing and exciting pipeline programs at our upcoming investor conference on May 21 in New York City.","In summary, while we have a lot of hard work ahead, as we continue to position for the future, I'm confident that we are up for the task. Now I'll pass it to Jay for deeper dive on the fourth quarter performance and outlook for 2018.","James Saccaro","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results, which represented a strong finish to a great year. I'll start by discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results before providing our financial outlook for 2018.","Beginning with the fourth quarter, sales increased 5% on a reported basis, 3% of constant-currency and 2% on an operational basis. Key growth drivers for the quarter included a continued momentum across our U.S. fluid systems and renal businesses, as well as strength internationally in nutrition and increased demand for our cytotoxic contract manufacturing services. As previously mentioned, disruptions to our Puerto Rico manufacturing facilities negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by approximately $70 million.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 12% to $0.64 per diluted share. This exceeded our previous guidance of $0.56 to $0.59 per share, driven by operational performance, disciplined management of expenses and a modest benefit from foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions.","Now, I'll walk you through performance by business. I'll speak to growth figures on an operational basis to provide a clearer understanding of underlying performance. As a reminder, operational growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange, U.S. cyclophosphamide, Claris, and select strategic product exits. Global sales for Hospital Products were $1.7 billion, advancing 1% operationally. Breaking this out by business, sales in Fluid Systems were $632 million, up 2% operationally. Performance was driven by strength for large volume IV solutions and IV access set in the U.S. Growth from the quarter was offset by lower sales internationally and impact from Hurricane Maria.","Integrated Pharmacy Solutions, or IPS, sales were $602 million, flat to prior year on an operational basis. Sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by $56 million from Hurricane Maria which offset increased sales of our premixed injectable drugs in the U.S. and from nutritional therapies internationally, as well as strengthen our hospital pharmacy compounding business. Sales of U.S. Cyclo was $43 million in the quarter and Claris contributed $30 million globally.","Moving to Surgical Care, which includes anesthesia and advanced surgery; total sales were $363 million, increasing 3% operationally. Growth in the quarter benefited from increased sales in inhaled anesthetics internationally, and U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC. Also contributing to performance was growth in advanced surgery of 3%. Sequentially, advanced surgery grew 5% as we are beginning to recognize many of the actions we have implemented to improve performance in this business. Fourth quarter surgical care was impacted by lower sales of Transderm Scope as a result of increased competition. Finally, in Hospital Products, sales in our other category were $108 million, increasing 1% driven by favorable demand for the company's cytotoxic manufacturing services.","Turning to our Renal business; sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up 4% operationally. Sales in the quarter benefited from solid performance across all lines of the business. Chronic renal therapies, inclusive of PD, in-center HD and renal therapy services rose 3% globally and our Acute Renal therapy's business delivered high-single digit growth globally, driven by balanced growth in the U.S. and internationally.","Walking through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 44.3% declined 20 basis points over the prior year; operational expansion due to positive mix, select pricing and business transformation initiatives was more than offset by the impact on lost sales due to Hurricane Maria and a negative impact from foreign exchange.","Adjusted SG&A totaled $628 million, increasing 2% on reported basis but declining 1% on a constant currency basis. The positive contribution from our relentless focus on effectively managing our expense base was offset by lower transition service agreement income from Shire and more than two percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $182 million increased 20% versus prior year, reflecting our stated intention to accelerate investments in our core growth businesses. Growth in the quarter also reflect the timing of some milestone payments to partners. Foreign exchange contributed 5 percentage points to growth in the quarter.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 15.1%, a decline of 30 basis points versus the prior year. Strong operational performance in the quarter was more than offset by the loss of transition service income, foreign exchange and the impact of Hurricane Maria. Net interest expense was $14 million in the quarter. Adjusted other income totaled $24 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a benefit from foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions. The adjusted tax rate was 17.7% for the quarter, which reflects approximately $8 million of benefit from the new stock compensation guidance. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.64 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.56 to $0.59 per share, driven by operational strength, expense savings and the gain on foreign exchange balance sheet positions.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $290 million, or approximately 4.5 million shares. These repurchases were somewhat offset by option-related dilution.","Now turning to full year 2017. Sales increased 4% on reported basis; 4% at constant currency and 5% on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 27% to $2.48 per diluted share driven by operational strength, the ongoing benefit from our business transformation efforts and a favorable tax rate.","Moving quickly through the rest of the P&L; our adjusted gross margin of 44.8% increased by 90 basis points over the prior year reflecting favorable product mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio and manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted SG&A totaled approximately $2.4 billion, decreasing by 4% and adjusted R&D spending totaled $617 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the year was 16%, a 240 basis point increase versus the prior year and at the high end of our expectations.","Net interest expense was $55 million, and adjusted other income totaled $47 million. The full year adjusted tax rate was 18% which included the benefit of approximately $56 million related to new stock compensation guidance. And finally, adjusted earnings of $2.48 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $2.40 to $2.43.","Before turning to our 2018 outlook, I will provide some commentary regarding our cash flow performance. On a full year basis, we have generated free cash flow of more than $1.2 billion, an improvement of more than $300 million versus the prior year. Growth was driven by underlying operational performance and lower CapEx along with the continued focus on improving the company's working capital performance.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018. As previously mentioned, we have updated our external sales reporting structure and I will provide guidance consistent with this new format. Globally we expect 2018 full year sales to increase between 6% to 7% on a reported basis and approximately 4% on both a constant currency basis and an operational basis.","I would like to point out some key assumptions reflected in our full year sales outlook which include approximately 250 basis points of favorable foreign exchange contribution. Approximately $25 million of negative sales impact from Hurricane Maria in the first quarter. Approximately $145 million from Claris sales is compared to $57 million in 2017. Full year U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of approximately $95 million versus $185 million in 2017. We have for the most part anniversary select strategic product exits we have undertaken and leveled while we will continue to optimize the portfolio, we will no longer be adjusting sales for these exits.","And finally, this guidance does not include any contribution from the two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt. We continue to expect this transaction to close in the first half of the year. In terms of our new external reporting structure we will no longer be classifying sales by the two segments of hospital products and renal. Sales will now be broken down into six global businesses and the segment analysis we provide will be reported by our three regions; Americas, EMEA, Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific.","As Clare mentioned, we have posted schedules on our website reclassifying sales into the new global business unit structure. Sales guidance has been provided in the new structure on a constant currency basis starting with Renal Care which includes our peritoneal dialysis, in-center hemodialysis and renal therapy services; we expect growth of 3% to 4%.","Our next global business, medication delivery which includes infusion systems, large and small volume IV solutions, and our reconstitution product such as Mini-Bag Plus, we expect to see this area to grow 6% to 7%. The pharmaceutical business which includes our broad generic injectibles portfolio, anesthesia and critical care products and our hospital pharmacy compounding services conducted outside the U.S.; performance in this business is expected to be flat to 2017 given some sales we recognized in 2017 that are not expected to repeat in 2018 along with increased competition for select products.","Moving to our next global business, nutrition, which was previously part of integrated pharmacy solutions; we expect sales growth of 4% to 5%. For our advanced surgery business we expect sales to increase 3% to 4%, for the acute therapies business we anticipate growth of 8% to 9%, similar to 2017 levels. Finally, in the other business which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services, we expect low single-digit decline as 2017 sales benefited from a customer stockpile order and we're projecting also lower manufacturing revenues from Shire.","Moving down to P&L; we anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 to 100 basis points. We expect net interest expense to total between $65 million to $70 million and adjusted other income between $50 million and $60 million for 2018. For the year we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%, the tax rate reflects approximately one percentage point benefit from the new U.S. tax reform legislation and a lower benefit from stock compensation. For full year 2018, we anticipated diluted average share account of approximately 550 million shares; this reflects the benefit of certain ongoing share repurchases. Based on these factors, we expect 2018 adjusted earnings excluding special items of $2.72 to $2.80 per diluted share.","Finally, for the year we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion. We expect CapEx of approximately $700 million and as a result we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion. Specific to the first quarter of 2018 we expect sales growth of 5% to 6% on a reported basis and 1% to 2% on a constant currency basis; operationally sales in the first quarter are expected to be flat to up 1%. And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.60 to $0.62 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com. And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","Let me start with this fourth quarter. If I back out the Puerto Rico impact from the quarter, you're at $0.70, you're at $2.80 run rate. How do I think about that as I go into your 2018 guidance because obviously your earnings power is a lot higher than just the headline numbers suggest here.","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Mike, your math is not totally incorrect but there is a caveat to it. The second phosphamide is a huge reduction, close to $100 million reduction year-over-year; we're expecting new entrants as we don't have a crystal ball but we have our best intelligence, so we are estimating that we're going to have one or two entrants in 2018 and that is one of the reasons by which we have a significant reduction in the EPS on the run rate basis; we're compensating that with other things, not just Claris. And also we had one-time reduction in the -- like you noted, Hurricane Maria provides a positive momentum in 2018 versus 2017 but the biggest difference is the $100 million with cyclophosphamide.","Michael Weinstein","You bought back more stock this quarter than you had been buying back and I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that and then in the broader context of capital allocation going forward. Obviously, there has been a lot of discussion last several quarters about M&A and the opportunity for you guys to do some bolt-on transaction using Claris. Last year you had the Mallinckrodt deal that's pending but you have a balance sheet that enables us to do both, bolt-on M&A and buybacks. It looks like you've stepped up your activity this quarter, how should we think about it for '18? And are you assumingly incremental buybacks in your guidance? Thanks.","James Saccaro","Overall, if you look at 2017, we've purchased the company for approximately $600 million, we also repurchased approximately $600 million worth of shares and so if you put that in the context of free cash flow of $1.2 billion, we essentially deployed all of it. Now our objective is not relative to a free cash flow number but I can tell you that we intend to be active, both on the business development front and on the buyback front. I talked to you in the past about how we think about buyback; we have an internal model which calculates the value of the shares, and as we look at the share price we look at opportunities to purchase shares relative to that looking for a discount. I mean, typically the share is traded at a discount so we are active buyers in the marketplace.","We expect to continue to do this through 2018 and we also expect to continue to do a number of bolt-on transactions, of course and Joe will speak to this in a moment; for us we have to be very disciplined about business development and so it's not just about doing deals, it's about doing very positive deals for our company. Similar to this Mallinckrodt deal. As far as the guidance, we have embedded some incremental guidance, we've been repurchasing shares in the quarter, this current quarter we expect about $500 million worth of buyback currently planned although I expect this is not the final number, it will be different than that and it will be based on the mechanics that I described earlier.","Joe, you want to talk about business development?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Sure. So going back to the team of capital allocation, I think Jay described pretty accurately our ability to do all of those things together. Our intention is to look at our businesses on an adjacency basis and do those incremental deals at a higher volume and velocity, meaning, more of them and a little faster as we continue to refine our M&A group, our M&A group is now complete, we have very strategic group in place, we have a pretty well defined boundaries where we want to go and I never take no, never considered that larger acquisitions are completely off the table, they are just difficult to come by and they are much more difficult to-date to get decent returns on those. But we -- as we look opportunistic at many different things, our focus in M&A and strategy are the cases it's going to continue to do that.","But we can do the three things that we have planned all along; we continue to buy shares, we're going to continue to pay the dividends and increase dividends every year like we have done in the past, and do the small deals or deals which are complimentary in high volume and velocity.","Michael Weinstein","I don't want to go through all the different businesses and the guidance for 2018 is relative to our expectations; but I don't want too many surprises, I thought that you're probably being a bit conservative and advanced surgery given the product flow there in the R&D, then put it in the work side, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. And as well maybe the same comment on the renal side where there is a lot going on and really all three or four different parts of that business. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Thank you, Mike. I have to think that we are good forecasters of our business and this is the beginning of the year. We always have the ability to -- for the most part to do what we saw we're going to do. So when we give a number to this suite there is something we have confidence that we can achieve. Clearly, the year always hold surprises, we had a huge one with Hurricanes visit. But the company has enough in the back to be able to provide [indiscernible] results till we're be dead.","I would say that we good growth in most of our business and we are continue to do geographic expansion product launches. So the ability to can't exceeded directly related to execution on the new products in second half of the year when we come in with the new pump version for SIGMA SPECTRUM, launch of our new peritoneal dialysis automated device in Japan in geographic expansion. So if we can execute on those things, everything goes right, we'll let you guys know and we will change our outlook for the year but at the moment that's what we see with a significant amount of puts and takes including cyclophosphamide.","Operator","The next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch","I just want to quickly start-off on IV solutions; I know that you made the comments that you expect to be back in -- I think more normalized supply in the U.S. over the coming weeks. What gets you there? Is it a combination of the ability to import and Puerto Rico continuing to ramp up? And then if you could sort of segment that between large volume IVs and Mini-Bags?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Larry, we can split the conversation into two pieces. The piece that got affected by the hurricane is a small volume parenteral that we'll call the SCP, those are we call Mini-Bags, Mini-Bag Plus. And pre-filled bags in small amounts for nutrition, amino acids, dual chamber bags and other things like that. So we have two different distinctive situations; let's -- let me talk about the small parenteral bags. We are producing at a pretty good clip at our plants in Puerto Rico, we supplemented that production with volume that is coming from Ireland, our Casabar [ph] facility. And we'll continue to make progress and we think by the end of the first quarter, though the production -- the inventory levels will be at a place that we can put this behind us.","As we speak today, the allocation that we put out it is 100%; so people can buy Mini-Bags and Mini-Bags Plus today, we just changed that at 100% of the average purchasing volume of six months ago. So -- and we will get this completely normalized by the end of the first quarter, probably earlier than that. So we also have contingency plans which will put towards the end of '18, mid '19 more capacity for Mini-Bag Plus for two reasons. One is, we have the ability to sell as much as we make, it's better for the market and more profitable for Baxter; so we're shifting that mix to benefit all the stakeholders including ourselves in terms of profitability.","The second part of the conversation is that large volume parenteral that has nothing to do with the hurricane, that has to do with increased demand and the inability of some of the manufacturers in the marketplace to make the product. We obtain permanent importation licenses and product registration for Mexico, we walk away from some of the business that we had in Mexico which can be taken over by a local competitors and is moving their volume permanently to the U.S. The second thing is, yesterday we just got approval from importation permits for Brazil, so now the product is going to be coming into the U.S. and we -- so by the end of this next six months, we will have a network of global factories that cost effectively can bring products into the U.S. in any situation, even to guarantee future contracts with our current customers and potential new customers.","Lawrence Keusch","And then one other one, maybe a little bit longer in nature; I think Joe that you've been focused on Japan as an opportunity, it sounds like you guys are fairly under indexed there relative to other large multinational U.S. company. So just briefly, how do we think about the opportunity there in Japan and what are you doing?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","In Japan; the first opportunity for us is to capitalize in the tremendously under penetrated peritoneal dialysis business. Japan has a very, very, very rich reimbursement for PD and we make significant amount of profit from that modality but the volume compared to the rest of the world is quite small. So by launching the new Kaguia [ph] cycler in Japan we'll be able to satisfy some of the market needs for instances; more connectivity of the tubing [ph] in this machine is done automatically, hence free. So there are some peculiarities that Japan requires to adopt technologies different, we as a company have done not a great job in Japan once we separate from Baxalta because Baxalta was the bulk of the business in Japan.","And our business now will focus on augmentation of the PD, launching new advanced surgery products in Japan, as well as augmenting the pharmaceutical capabilities in Japan. So this is more of a long-term roadmap but I tell you that is one that has our focus and in fact now is the -- present for Asia, Japan falls under him and we have significant plans for talent improvement to be able to get those things there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe on the Q1 guidance on -- the revenue guidance; so some of the questions I'm getting is, if sequentially you had capacity coming back from Puerto Rico, right, was this guide a little bit tad below or what was the sweetness modeling on some of the line items?","James Saccaro","Just a couple of things to point out in relation to Q1 sales growth which to your point Vijay is below the run rate we expect for the balance of the year, solid operational performance but Puerto Rico does impact us by one point of growth. And then the other comment I would make is, our -- last year we had a bolus of sales related to a product called Transderm Scope, and year-over-year that's about 1% headwind. So those two items collectively drag down the growth little bit below what we expect moving forward.","The other thing that happens as we approach the latter part of the year is, we start to benefit from some of the new products launches. Joe mentioned, Kagulia [ph]; we're also extremely excited about the version 9 spectrum pump which we anticipate launching towards the end of the first half of the year, and so that starts to benefit and accelerate some growth. So two very specific items and then certain benefit from new products is really the story on Q1 relative to rest of your sales guidance.","Vijay Kumar","Just a couple of quick guidance follow-ups; one, into the segment details, this is extremely helpful, the historical numbers you gave out but on that medication delivery but it's capacity is coming back from Mexico repurposing capacity rates, if I'm looking at year-on-year, flattish to maybe up slightly. So one, I'll be fair to assume -- this guidance has six to seven Delaware does not assume incremental shares and I have one follow-up on that free cash. Thank you.","James Saccaro","As we look at 2018 performance for medication delivery, we are going to benefit certainly from the reallocation of sales back to the U.S. from IVs, from some of the markets that Joe mentioned early on. So that's certainly is a tail-wind for us. What I will tell you is over the last several years, we benefited from a number of items including the relaunch of Version 8 pump which featured prominently in our numbers, for a number of quarters. We also benefited from negotiation of selected grim [ph] that we have in place with GPOs. So there is -- we've always anticipated and we've model long-term that there would be a deceleration into grow, and particular in the U.S. overtime but this guidance is largely consistent with our expectations and does reflect some benefit of the reallocational products.","Vijay Kumar","The free cash guidance, so that's -- call it double-digit growth or '17; but if we're looking at their 2020 targets of $2 billion, so that is how free cash flow accelerates back the high-teens. Was there any timing impact for '18 when you look at the free cash number?","James Saccaro","What I will tell us is, relative to the guidance that we shared in July our confidence in our long-term ability to generate cash flow has increased in the sense that we had a great 2017 performance ahead of our expectations, so solid performance on free cash flow. Not really timing items, specifically I think we were pleased to exceed $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion will reflect in continued performance with respect to working capital management which we are driving relentlessly along with continued operating income growth. So stay tuned, we'll watch this one closely, it's always very difficult at the start of the year to predict cash flow, it's a highly volatile number, it's the most -- frankly, the most challenging one for us to predict on a full year basis.","So stay tuned, we'll watch this one carefully as we go on but I will tell you, the performance of our team on the supply chain side on accounts payable, receivable side; very good performance and we're tracking where we want to be on the free cash flow side.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor","The first question I wanted to ask was -- just around the injectibles outlook in Claris; I guess you gave us a number for Claris, I was hoping maybe you could supplement that with some color on what you're expecting from your internal program and maybe any update on the Claris 43 and how you're doing with the remediation there?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","We are continuing to pursue internal development. We are launching a coronary drug, just got approved. We have other drugs planned to be launched here, either frozen or not frozen dump made by Galaxy. We continue to launch products outside Claris, outside the U.S. for Claris and the 43 is quite simply, we have done to date everything that we said we were going to do, we're still not finished, we have couple of more things to do but we're still in the timeline in some of the things we're doing ahead of our timeline. We are optimistic that what we're doing is going to resolve the issues outlined in 43 but we are not the agencies, so we cannot speak on behalf of the agency, we do everything we can to satisfy what we said to the agents we're going to do and we feel comfortable that we're doing, now rest is with the FDA to make that determination but we work very hard and we have integrated significant amount of quality systems into the best of quality systems and if you went to the [indiscernible] today, you would see a significant amount of physical improvement in things that we've done to correct issues that we personally as a company have found and stuff that the FDA has found on top of our findings.","Matthew Taylor","And I want to give you a chance to -- without bias can you maybe talk about some of the tailwinds from a product standpoint in 2018, and specifically we'd like to hear from you products that you think can make a difference that you believe are underappreciated by investors?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","I'll focus on three or four errors. First of all, I think our ability to provide the market with LVPs and SVPs add to volumes that the market not only needs but potentially have comparative -- going to competitive accounts is a potential upside, we don't know if that's going to materialize the competitive accounts but we know that we now have solid factories being completely focused in the U.S. market. BAX is largest manufacturer solutions in the world and having no use of that capability in the past was a mistake, now we're full engaged in using this capability and flexibility across the globe; so that is a positive.","I think the new version of our pump, SIGMA SPECTRUM, coming out now in the second half of the year is a good thing; the pump has really new features and new things that we think are needed in the marketplace and the people waiting for it, so our ability to launch that well offers the possibility to be positive for us. The third one is the launch of the Kaguia [ph] in Japan, I think that is a positive. In geographic expansion, lastly is, we're trying to get products approved, we just got one approved in China the other date after earlier this week we just got a monitor 1898 [ph] approved in China for sale, way ahead of time. So our people are trying to work very diligently in new products to be able to get those things to augment our objective in the mid-term which is to get the company to a 5% topline growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Danielle Antalffy","Just at a high level, if you think about beyond 2018 and what in the pipeline -- and Joe, maybe this is a question for you as well, what do you see is the key pipeline initiative that are going to drive accelerating growth beyond the 4% operationally or projecting in 2018, number one? And then Jay for you, number two, the incremental leverage you can pull on the P&L to drive positive leverage in the out years considering it feels like a lot of low hanging fruit might have already been picked here?","James Saccaro","I'll start by talking about the operating margin leverage that we have and then Joe, perhaps you can talk about some of the exciting pipeline products that start to accelerate growth as we move past 2018. And by the way, it's a bit premature to talk about '19 and '20 as we sit here on February 1, so that's a risk of doing that. I think we are very pleased with the transformation efforts on the cost side. Danielle, your question is good one because to a large extent we have taken a lot of low hanging fruit and reflected that in our numbers over the last couple of years in terms of implementing zero based budgeting, certain other tactics that we've employed. As we look at 2019-2020 and beyond, there are certain more complicated or bit more challenging programs that we have on the back office with respect to G&A and perhaps it's better to say longer lead time items, as we look to transform our back office to streamline shared service centers, we've made tremendous progress, our functions have done really amazing work, but our expectational long is that those would not have an impact in 2016 or 2017 but would start to playout as we're seeing in 2018 and then 2019 and 2020.","So that's one area I would say, and then the other thing that's going to be very interesting as we move to 2019 and 2020 is, our manufacturing team has done a great job in terms of controlling cost, now obviously that team has been very focused on responding to things like natural disasters and tight supply situation, so they've been very focused on that but at the same time they've been very focused on optimizing on manufacturing network and optimizing operations within our manufacturing network. And so moving to 2019 and 2020, we continue to expect very solid performance coming out of that team along with a restored supply situation. Now with respect to acceleration of growth on the top line and products that are going to drive that, Joe, maybe you could take that one.","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Our mid-term goal for the top line is 5%, we work very hard to get there and to get there is the ability to launch those new products, little better than we have planned and there is opportunity for that. So the first one as I said is optimization, the supply chain have in the right part and in the right place in U.S. if you're confident on that. The second is the launch of the product in Japan, the Kagua [ph] in cycle. The third is geographic expansion, get this thing right. Fourth, the pump, the SIGMA SPECTRUM, remember our medication delivery guidance for global growth is between 6% and 7% for 2018 which is pretty good growth. Then, let's look at little bit more on the mid-term, let's talk about '19 and beyond. TheraNova is a game changer in-center HD, so having that thing -- having the product completely approved in U.S., have the clinical trials in and have the ability to drive adoption in the U.S. is key for us to continue to grow.","Launching PrisMAX which is our new acute renal care, CRRT monitor in the U.S. will drive continuously more growth in U.S., we're already market leaders in acute renal care with the CRRT modality, this is over $1 billion in market, we only have this modality which is CRRT was continuous renal replacement therapy has only 50% or less of the overall market, so the conversion is great. Also, getting in other modalities in the acute renal care is a desire of ours; and please don't forget that some of these acquisitions that we're making, we will have organic impact in the company once the anniversary meaning they have -- their own growth, we're not buying businesses, they have 0% growth, if we're buying business they have the ability -- like Claris, that's 12% to 14% growth happening in 2018. So there is opportunity going forward, we're ceding the way to be able to get to 5% and like they said, with the significant smaller cost base for the company to operate brings a very desirable form to the table.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Lewis","Just thinking about the pacing of 2018 numbers, I think so description of first quarter topline; just in the bottom line Jay, I think our math has 50 bips of margin maybe for the first quarter? Can you just talk a little bit about the factors impacting the bottom line for the first quarter? And then, as you think about the third quarter, that's either tough comp this year, should we also expect growth to be a little low in the third, kind of similar to the first?","James Saccaro","Yes, I think that in the first quarter to your point we're seeing the lowest level of sales growth of the year and then also as we look at the bottom line there, there are a number of factors in play that impact bottom line growth; the first one being Puerto Rico, that's a couple of cents of margin impact that we expect to see and that's probably the most prominent. On the operating margin line, the Puerto Rico impact is roughly 40 basis points. Some of the other should -- the TDS sales item, that does not really have a bottom line impact, so I would say that if you adjust for that along with a tough TSA comp which represents about 50 basis points impact in the first quarter, remember, we -- that ceases to be an issue for us in the second half of the year. Those two items really explain why the margin would be the lowest growth rate in the first quarter relative to the other quarters in the year and we start to see acceleration there. So really those are the two items explaining about roughly one point of the growth.","As we look to the balance of the year, we do expect to see solid performance throughout and so 2018 -- the third quarter does represent the tough sales comp but importantly, we'll start to benefit from some of the new product launches, so the version 9 of the SPECTRUM pump just starts to feature in our Q3 results. So I think that on balance we feel quite good about the quarterly forecast; Q1, a little bit of a slower start but again, that is entirely explained by things like Puerto Rico and TDS and then, as we move through the rest of the year, the story becomes consistent with the full year picture. The one item I would say in Q3, we do have $20 million compounding settlement in our 2017 results, so we'll probably talk about that but beyond that I think it's fairly steady progress.","David Lewis","And Joe, just two strategic questions for you. I guess the first is, one that is breaking out of this global business structure, it occurs to me that some of the businesses you're breaking out actually have dramatically faster end market growth rates. I mean as you think about this new structure, are you starting to be of the view that the weighted average market growth rate for this business is frankly closer to 5%, relative to 4%?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","I think our weighted average market growth rate for the overall business is 3% but the ability to perform at 5% has to do with new product launches and the ability to focus, so hence the organizational restructuring. We were not focused and now deploying capital some time ago to the right business, despite the fact our intention was that but the organization structure was not prepared. What it has allowed us to do is two-fold; get people paid on global growth or certain franchise, second, allow us to really put people in those business with more specializing given exempt of pharmaceutical for instance. We have a big mountain to climb with $100 million in headwind on cyclophosphamide.","Now having execution of Claris and our own organic molecules is key; to do that you got to have people who understand the generic pharmaceutical business, this is not a hospital product, this is not the same people who will do design infusion lines and infusion pumps, it's completely different. So we brought and are bringing people who have the ability to bring this business to the next level. So this reflects more of how we want to beat people, how we want people to focus and also to get to our 5% objective on the top line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen","I wanted to start with the operating margin guidance and the goal for 2020, I think of 20% Jay. So this year I think you're guiding to 80 basis points to 100 basis points of operating margin improvement, I guess that implies that you need about 150 basis points per year in '19 and '20 to reach the 20%. So why only 80 basis points to 100 basis points this year and that acceleration? I think earlier in prior calls, I think there was an impression that you could do a little better than 20%, do you still feel that you can exceed that number and I have one follow-up.","James Saccaro","I'll talk about 2018. As far as 2020, we remain very confident in our ability to drive the business going forward. So I would insert a brief commercial for our May Investor Day, we look forward to updating our long-term financial projections for both 2020 and beyond which the whole team is really excited about that. As it relates to 2018 guidance, there is actually three items that I think are worthwhile pointing out that provides some color because on the one hand you could say 80 basis points to 100 basis points and that's what we expect but there is three headwinds to point out. First, cyclophosphamide is approximately 70 basis points of impact in this year, so that's an assumption that we've made, we'll see, we'll monitor this very closely but that's a very big drag on 2018. And frankly, as we look at margin performance over the next three years, we're modeling the largest single impact occurring in 2018.","The second item is we have approximately 40 basis points of impact from TSA income loss. So again, that's an item that is explicit to 2018 that does not impact future years. The final thing I would comment on is, we have adopted the new guidance for pension accounting and what that means is, a number of items have moved below the line and there are certain items maintained above the line. This will be spelled out in detail in our 10-K but at the highest level reflecting this guidance is about 40 basis points drag on our results in 2018. We'll footnote this and describe in a lot of detail as I say in our 10-K, there will be also be some additional information available related to 2017 impact but if simply put in our 80 basis points to 100 basis points, this 40 basis points of headwind is related to the new pension accounting.","So as we think about what those drivers add upto, that's about 150 basis points of drags that we work through this year on our way to achieving the 80 basis points to 100 basis points of margin improvement. We don't expect similar magnitude and so it becomes -- we can sit here confidently and say we feel very solid about 2019 and 2020 performance.","Larry Biegelsen","Lastly for me, Joe, any update on emerging market performance?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Yes, we had a pretty good performance in emerging markets. We had about 6.7%, close to 7% in emerging markets for the year. We also had China over 6% which is great for us. I just want to underscore that emerging markets like medical devices qualify does not apply to Baxter, we've been in those markets for a long time. So China for us is a good growth market, has a good GDP growth and that represents an opportunity for us to geographically expand new product lines there, as well as Brazil and Mexico, Columbia; I see those as probably the most prominent and then Southeast Asia. So, we do emerging markets commentary on calls for actually you folks, the analysts.","Internally we have three different regions in the world; Americas, Europe and Asia, and we don't specifically monitor emerging markets anymore. We monitor specifically China which we think has continued to perform well and it's a very profitable and large market for us. And if you qualify emerging markets like -- you speak as about 22% of our overall sale; so it's very much larger than for many of our peers. So that's why we don't focus on that.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Joan [ph] of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Joe, big picture medtech [ph]. You guys are probably closest to the ground at what's happening in the hospital as it relates to volume, price and flu. Can you just give us some of the brief overview of what you're really seeing out there?","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","We're projecting low single-digits for hospital procedures and admissions in general, that's what we see in our -- when we connect the dots of our businesses. We also see a renewed interest in the capital investment from hospitals, at least, one of the large hospital enough for profit groups announced that they will revitalize plans for investment and that is good for the market. And we see also in general, consumption at a stable tools like a positive level. So it is altogether a unique situation for the country, for the U.S. is specifically where we see the healthcare markets reacting well to new tax legislation and so forth. The flu season is clearly picking up a significant money, [indiscernible] is already high for all accounts and there is some -- there is always slight positive impact because couple of our businesses and products that are used for situations where patient is in ICU with distress and multi-organ failure; so there is a pickup for our business when there is a good flu season, flu season is at all-time high.","Unidentified Analyst","A follow-up and more specific question; every year I feel like we start-off with a relatively high cyclo competition headwind and then window it down throughout the year. Why is $100 million the right number for 2018? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 Almeida","Because we do model quite extensively and very precisely the impact of one entrant, two entrants, three entrants, four entrants; we do this because as a matter of fact we are sometimes on the other end, we're coming in as the second or the third entrant, so we know what the number is. So we have modeled based on the number of applications out there for cyclophosphamide that that is the impact. Now if people can pull it, pull-through, they don't have the regulatory capability; clearly, there is an upside for Baxter and we'll let you know as we give updates to our quarterly forecasts and update guidance if we see that there is no entrant, we will update and increase that if that's the case.","And as I always say, we're very transparent about cyclophosphamide and it's always a positive for the company because there is more cash in our blanket. And it's a drug that is proven through many that it's not that easy to make. You know, cytotoxic drugs are very difficult to make and Baxter has a state-of-the-art facility that is not only used by us but used by many different pharmaceutical companies because the difficulty of doing it. So the desire to do it is not that -- doesn't relate to the ability to do it and recently one potential manufacturer got two warning letters in their facility in India [ph], so that probably put a stop on their ability to produce. But there are others out there then we have models, so if they come to the market we estimate it very precisely, $100 million of impact.","Operator","Thank you.

Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Candace. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer.

Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you, Clare, and good morning to everyone joining us. I'm going to share a few comments on our second quarter performance. Then Jay will walk through the financials and guidance in more detail. And we will close as always by taking your questions. I would like to start by saying how energizing it was meeting with so many of you face-to-face at our investor conference. Thanks also to those of you who attended online or watched the replay. Our team was excited to share the next chapter in Baxter's story, our progress to date and more importantly, our opportunities and outlook ahead.","We've set a clear path to deliver approximately 5% compounded annual growth through 2023. We will accomplish this objective by building on the strength of our base business and accelerating innovation. As we shared at the conference, we plan to introduce new therapies and products that I expect to contribute approximately $1.7 billion of sales by 2023. At the same time, we remain relentless focus on enhancing operational efficiency to deliver increased value to shareholders. And we will augment this performance with business development, expanding into new adjacencies and unlocking new markets to drive incremental value for all the stakeholders.","Now turning to the quarter. Second quarter 2018 sales were up 9% on a reported basis, 5% on a constant currency basis, and 4% operationally. Second quarter operational sales adjust for the impact foreign exchange, generic competition for cyclophosphamide in the U.S., the Claris acquisition, and our acquisition of two surgical products from Mallinckrodt. The strength in the quarter was driven by double digit growth in our Pharmaceuticals business, which benefited from increased sales of injectable pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and the addition of Claris, which contributed $33 million of sales in the quarter.","We also experienced double digit growth in our Advanced Surgery business driven by solid international performance and the addition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK, which contributed $17 million of sales during the quarter. Our Acute Therapies business continued to deliver double digit growth for the company. Performance in the quarter was driven by 20% growth in the U.S. where we remain focused on increasing CRRT adoption and securing new customers. Increased demand for our contract manufacturing services as well as solid growth in our Renal Care business also contributed to growth in the quarter. This momentum helped to offset declines in Medication Delivery and Clinical Nutrition.","Digging into these specific performance a bit further, with respect to large-volume parenterals, or LVPs, we continue to gain new customers in U.S. following the reallocation of volume from Mexico to the U.S. But the uptick in timing of these additions has been somewhat slower than anticipated. We are confident in our ability to continue to gain additional new customers in the second half of the year.","Performance in Medication Delivery was also impacted by the lower sales of small-volume parenterals, or SVPs, in the quarter. While production volumes continue to improve, supply of these products has remained tight. As such, we were unable to restore our distribution partners back to pre-hurricane supply levels for all SVP product quotes during the quarter. Given current production levels, we expect this supply dynamic for SVPs to improve in the coming weeks.","For our nutritional therapies, we have experienced a delay in customers returning to their historical purchasing patterns that preceded Hurricane Maria. Our marketing teams are working closely with our customers to reinforce availability of products and recapture those sales. Overall, our sales performance conveys the strategic benefits of our diversified portfolio, helping to ensure that temporary headwinds in certain areas are counterbalanced by performance company wide.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $0.77, a 22% year-over-year increase. This reflects the impact of our top line growth as well as the ongoing impact of our business transformation initiatives. At the investor conference we emphasized that product innovation is central to our go-forward growth strategy. Some key recent highlights reflect this commitment. Expansion of the company's Medication Delivery portfolio with two new innovative drug infusion pumps. FDA and Health Canada approvals of the Spectrum IQ Infusion System with those IQ Safety Software. Our latest smartphone platform features bidirectional EMR integration and other enhancements to help reduce programming errors and enhance patient safety. CE Marking for the Evo IQ Infusion System in the United Kingdom and Ireland, representing the first in a series of planned regulatory submissions internationally.","In Canada, we advanced the launch of a new indication for our oXiris set. oXiris is the first blood purification set that can be used in continuous renal replacement therapy, CRRT, and sepsis management protocols, and it is now approved in more than 30 countries. And we introduced key program updates for our SHARESOURCE remote patient management platform to support greater accessibility and efficiencies in remotely viewing PD, patient data.","Another theme at the Investor Conference was addressing our untapped potential in Japan. In Q2, we continued the successful rollout of our Kaguya APD system with embedded SHARESOURCE technology, which targets Japan's unique market needs. Plus, we have recently initiated the launch of our Prismaflex system, which positions Baxter in Japan as the only comprehensive one stop partner in the acute care space.","Before closing, I would quickly share a few words about Claris. As you know, last week, the FDA released a warning letter regarding our legacy Claris Injectables' facility in Ahmedabad, India. The FDA initiated a site inspection at the time of the closing of our Claris acquisition, which took place one year ago this week. We have already taken many corrective actions in response to the FDA's original Form-483 observations. We are continuing to undertake actions and facility improvements as we integrate Ahmedabad into our Baxter Quality Systems.","The Claris deal is an important platform for the expansion of our Pharmaceuticals portfolio and pipeline. Financial results over the past year have tightly aligned with our expectations, and as indicated in our 8-K, we don't currently expect for the warning letter to have any material impact on our long range financial outlook issued this past May. We are continuing to invest in Ahmedabad to expand local capabilities, technologies and expertise. We have made solid progress and we'll continue working with FDA to ensure all outstanding observations are revolved as quickly and comprehensively as possible.","In closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance, which demonstrated the strength of our diversified portfolio. We remain squarely focused on increasing the innovation and is strategically deploying capital to further accelerate our performance, all in support of delivering even greater value for patients and investors.","I will now pass it to Jay for more details on our Q2 results and outlook for the balance of 2018.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results, which represented another solid quarter of continued momentum. I'll start by discussing our second quarter results before providing our updated financial outlook for 2018. Beginning with the second quarter, global sales of $2.8 billion were in-line with guidance, increasing 9% on a reported basis, 5% at constant currency, and 4% on an operational basis.","Key growth drivers for the quarter included increased sales of injectable pharmaceuticals, strength in the company's Renal Care and Acute Therapy businesses, as well as solid performance from our compounding and contract manufacturing businesses. And as Joe discussed, growth was partially offset by performance in our Medication Delivery and Clinical Nutrition businesses. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 22% to $0.77 per diluted share. This exceeded our previous guidance of $0.69 to $0.71 per share, driven by solid top-line performance, the ongoing benefit of our business transformation initiatives, a lower than expected tax rate, and other income.","Now I'll walk you through performance by our regions and global business units. Note, for this quarter, constant currency sales growth is equal to operational sales growth for all businesses with the exceptions of our Pharmaceuticals and Advanced Surgery businesses. For these businesses, we will provide operational growth, which adjust for the impact of generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide as well as the Claris and Mallinckrodt surgical product acquisitions.","Starting first with sales growth for our three regions, sales in the Americas advanced 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% operationally. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 3% both constant currency and operationally. And finally, sales in our Asia-Pacific region rose 6% on a constant currency basis and 5% operationally.","Moving on to performance by global business units. Global sales for Renal Care were $931 million, advancing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance was driven by solid growth in PD therapies globally as well as increased sales internationally for our HD business. Sales in Medication Delivery were $681 million, down 2% on a constant currency basis. And as Joe discussed, growth in this business was impacted by the timing of adding new customers in the U.S. for LVPs, residual supply constraints for SVPs following Hurricane Maria, and lower international sales resulting from reallocation of solutions volume to the U.S.","Pharmaceutical sales were $537 million, increasing 16% constant currency and 11% operationally. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by our injectables business, which benefited from increased sales of BREVIBLOC due to competitive supply constraints as well as strength in our premixed injectables and international hospital pharmacy compounding business. Sales of U.S. cyclo were $45 million in the quarter and Claris contributed $33 million globally.","Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $221 million, down 3% on a constant currency basis. Strong growth in international markets was offset by lower sales in the U.S., which Joe commented on earlier. Sales in Advanced Surgery were $204 million, increasing 12% constant currency and 2% operationally. Performance was driven by solid growth in international markets. As mentioned previously, we completed the acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK earlier this year. We're pleased with the contribution of these products which represented approximately $17 million in the quarter.","Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $129 million, representing growth of 10% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued strength in global demand for Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapies. Finally, sales in our Other category, which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services, were $139 million, an increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was primarily driven by increased demand for our contract manufacturing services.","Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 45.5% increased 20 basis points over the prior year. Underlying operational expansion was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental supply chain costs we absorbed during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $641 million, increasing 7% on a reported basis, and 4% on a constant currency basis. The positive contribution from our focus on effectively managing our expense base was offset by lower transition service agreement income from Shire and increased freight expense as we continue to ensure adequate product availability to meet our customer needs. The acquisition of Claris adds 1 point to growth in the quarter.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $164 million increased 6% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.1%, an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. Strong operational expansion of over 150 basis points in the quarter was also partially offset by the loss of transition service agreements income and foreign exchange. Net interest expense was $11 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of interest income due to rising interest rates.","Adjusted other income totaled $31 million in the quarter primarily reflecting a benefit from the recent changes we made to our U.S. pension plan and foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions. The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, which includes a benefit of $15 million from stock compensation. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.77 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.69 to $0.71 per share driven by solid top line performance, our business transformation initiatives, a lower than expected tax rate, and other income. During the second quarter we repurchased $259 million or 3.8 million shares. These repurchases were partially offset by option-related dilution in the quarter.","Before turning to our 2018 outlook, I will briefly comment on our cash flow performance. In the first half of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $541 million, an improvement of $50 million versus the prior year, driven by underlying operational performance as well as improvements in DSO and in DPO metrics.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2018. Globally, we now expect 2018 full year sales to increase approximately 6% on a reported basis given the strengthening dollar. We continue to expect growth of approximately 5% on a constant currency basis, and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. Operational growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange, U.S. cyclophosphamide sales from the first seven months of Claris, and sales from RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK.","Moving to guidance by business. On a constant currency and operational basis, except where otherwise noted, in Renal Care, we continue to expect growth of 3% to 4%. In Medication Delivery, we now expect sales to increase approximately 4%. We now expect our Pharmaceuticals business to increase 5% to 6% constant currency. This assumes 2018 U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of $130 million, slightly above previous guidance of $120 million. We continue to expect full year Claris sales of approximately $145 million. Adjusting for cyclo and the first seven months of Claris, operational growth is now expected to increase approximately 5%.","Moving to Clinical Nutrition, we now expect sales growth of approximately 2% as we work to return customers in the U.S. back to pre-hurricane purchase levels. For our Advanced Surgery business, we continue to expect sales to increase 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis. This includes the contribution of approximately $40 million related to the recent acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK. Excluding the impact of these sales, operational growth is expected to be between 3% and 4%. For the Acute Therapies business, we now anticipate growth of approximately 10% given the strong first half performance. Finally, in our Other business we now expect growth of 4% to 5%, given increased demand for our contract manufacturing services.","Moving down to P&L, we continue to anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points to 100 basis points. We expect net interest expense of approximately $50 million and adjusted other income of approximately $95 million for 2018. For the year, we now expect an averaged adjusted tax rate of approximately 17%, which reflects the lower rate we reported during the first half of the year, and a continued benefit from stock compensation in the second half of the year. For full year 2018, we anticipate a diluted average share count of approximately 548 million shares, which reflects the benefit of ongoing share repurchases, offset by option-related dilution. Based on these factors, we expect 2018 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.94 to $3.00 per diluted share.","Finally, for the year, we now expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $2.25 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, and free cash flow of approximately $1.55 billion. Specific to the third quarter of 2018, we expect sales growth of approximately 3% on a reported basis and between 3% and 4% on both on constant currency and operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.72 to $0.74 per diluted share in the third quarter.","With that, we can now open the call up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. So that we may be respectful of everyone's time, please limit your comments to one question with one follow-up question if necessary.

Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes, we can.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, great, great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I just wanted to start out with a question on revenue growth in the quarter. And I think I basically heard three areas where things were a little slower. On the LVP side, you talked about getting new customers, on the Med Delivery side about tight supply, and on the Nutritional side about delay and sort of post-hurricane situation there. Can you just kind of qualify those three things and their impact on the quarter, and then talk a little bit more specifically about when you expect those things to be fully resolved? It sounded like they'd be fully resolved by Q3 or during Q3, but I just wanted to be sure. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you, Bob, and good morning. I'm going to break the question into three areas so it becomes easier for us to speak about. LVP is a large volume parenterals. We have categorically not lost one point of share or one customer. We just were slower to convert new beds. We are converting new beds. As a matter of fact, we convert significant amount of beds, but late in the quarter, did not feel the effect.","We also had just taken a large OEM customer from a competitor, and we did this just now in early July, okay. So we were not fast enough coming off the hurricane. We got our volume repositioned. We got our supply chain with significant amounts of flexibilities, and we do have now the ability to direct our volumes not only to the U.S. but at anyplace in the world that we need volume. So that I feel very comfortable. Our team's just taking a little longer, and I feel that we're going to be able to get there in the second half.","Just so you know, there was about 16% of growth in the first half of the year in LVPs. So you know, 16% growth in the first half of the year. We slowed in the second quarter, probably some bleed of inventory, and now we're slow, and we were slow in picking up new customers, but categorically speaking, we have now lost one customer and one point of market share.","When it comes to SVPs, or small volumes parenterals, but \u2013 do you mind to mute your line? There's a \u2013 thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Perfect","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you. The SVPs. We are in tight supply level, recovering now quite fast. So these are Mini-Bags and Mini-Bag Plus. These products are designed to reconstitute pharmaceutical APIs, okay. So we were now in channel, meaning Cardinal, Owens, and Medline, people who distribute our products, now we have Mini-Bags into that channel. Mini-Bag Plus is not yet there. It's going to get there in September, meaning that when it gets in the channel, you get volume because some of these customers will not buy directly from us. But we had to take them off the channel because we are in short supply. So we also are putting these products in more than 100% allocations and we hope by the end of the year, early next year, Mini-Bag Plus and Mini-Bag will be off allocation. So a point on allocation. LVPs are 100% out of allocation. No more allocation for LVPs.","Let's now cover the Nutrition. The Nutrition side is the part we had the worst supply issues during the hurricane, those amino acids and other nutrients. Those are slow \u2013 we're feeling those are slower to pick up. Those are practice changes in hospitals. We are market leaders and we feel that they will probably be the slowest ones to pick up on the ramp-up curve. It's the smallest business that we have among them all, but we feel confident that in the next six to eight months, we'll be able to get back into a course. It's a slower process to recover than the SVPs and the LVPs. I hope that has clarified some of the questions that you and some of your colleagues may have in this area.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, definitely helpful. Just curious, Jay, if there is any kind of quantification of these three issues. And to sort of summarize all that I just heard, it sounds like the majority of all of these issues will be resolved this calendar year?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Bob, this is Joe. It is correct. In terms of quantification, we prefer not to get into the number of customers and things like this. I just gave you just a bit of a reference. We will probably convert approximately 4,000 beds in the second half of the year, okay. And we did about the same number in the first half, but most of that happened in the first quarter, not the second quarter. But just giving you the numbers for reference, and we'll stop here.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I'll start one on the guidance here, maybe just one clarification on some confusion on organic operational numbers in the Q. Operational was in line with how you guys were expecting, right? It's just cyclo came in a little bit better for the difference in how we do the math right. I wanted you to clarify that. And the guidance now for the year, given the 3Q operational growth guidance, that implies a big step up, high singles for Q4. Can you just walk us through on what changes in Q4?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, just to give a little context on our overall sales performance in the quarter, generally speaking we were pleased. Our operational guidance, which excludes the impact of cyclophosphamide and it also excludes acquisitions that we've undertaken, was 4%. The guidance that we provided was 3% to 4%. So sales came in strong. I think probably the most important aspect of Joe's commentary was the diversified nature of the portfolio that we have and the fact that we were able to offset some short-term challenges with strength elsewhere in the portfolio.","Now, moving to the back on an overall annual basis, our guidance operationally is 4% to 5%. And again there is a meaningful step up in the fourth quarter. The third quarter we guided operationally to 3% to 4%. Now, you'll recall last year we had a settlement with a compounding customer, which was about $20 million or 1 percentage point of growth. So that's one of the elements that takes \u2013 this Q3's a little bit more challenging for us, driving this 3% to 4% growth, which, again, organically we're in line with our expectations.","And then going to Q4, we do have the $70 million hurricane impact that's included in our numbers last year. So you will see, the fastest growth of the year we expect to take place in the fourth quarter.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then just one on margin stuff, Jay. So the guide for the year is \u2013 call it low 17s, right, and if I go back in a long-term guidance rate, so we're looking at north of 20% for 2020. So that would imply a 300 basis points margin expansion between 2019 and 2020, right. So that's a step up in margin expansion. When you're looking at 2019, 2020 versus 2018, I mean, maybe just talk about what would cause some optimism on the margin expansion side for 2019 and 2020. Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, look. We are extremely pleased with the margin progression of the business and this is very much in line with the expectations that we've outlined, and this is tracking very well. You'll recall, Vijay, at the spin-off we had a 9% or 10% margin. We outlined specific plans to take that to 17% over the course of three years, but we also recognized in the 2018 timeframe, there would be a number of headwinds that we would experience with respect to things like cyclophosphamide, the sunsetting of transition service agreement. And so if you were to adjust for those items, the 80 basis points to 100 basis points that we expect this year is a number that's much higher than that.","And so as we get some of these factors behind us in 2019 and 2020, we have clear line of sight, plans and expectations to drive the margin consistent with what we shared targeting the 20% to 21% by 2020. I'll remind you that when we put together the long range plan, there is no sort of unidentified item in the plan in the sense that every single cost program is delineated and specific included in our numbers, so there's no unidentified go-get that we have to get after. It is simply about executing the plans that we've laid out, managing against that.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Very helpful commentary, Jay. Congrats on a nice Q.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk maybe if you can about the Pharmaceutical businesses. That was one of the standouts there. Particularly, cyclophosphamide revenues going up for the year and a difficult comp in the U.S. business as there was the Transderm Scop benefit last year. So maybe talk about some of the underlying trends there and how sustainable that is.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Robbie, the strategy in Pharmaceutical is one to use the strength of the company in its formulation and drug-delivery technologies, and it always comes back to our ability to make products consistently like cyclo, like BREVIBLOC, and other drugs that are \u2013 the generics and the competition is coming, but people have a hard time consistently making this product. So hence the strategy that we've placed in front of you guys in our Investor Day in May. It's important that we continue to expand our Pharmaceutical business in tough-to-make molecules, cytotoxics, oncolytics, because despite the fact that other people have the desire to get in, they don't make it consistently.","So right now, there is another competitor in cyclophosphamide in the market. In BREVIBLOC, there's one coming in the month of September, and we plan another one coming in cyclo at the end of the year. As you can see, we continue to sell cyclophosphamide. We haven't seen the one that was approved come into the market. I think it's just a matter of time, but we have the advantage of having a consistent production of this product, and I think our team here in the U.S. has done a wonderful job really creating the commercial opportunities to make this business more reliant on us than other people, and more resilient.","As you can see, this business \u2013 we had spoken about this cyclophosphamide issue two years, three years ago, and we're still making the product and making a lot of money when we sell it, and we will continue to do it as long as the competitors are not getting or hesitant in getting the market. But I want the folks to understand that Baxter has unique capabilities and that's the reason why we're doubling down in Pharmaceuticals.","We \u2013 now, at this moment in time, we are planning for a second cyclo to come in \u2013 I'll say third, because Sandoz is already on the market. Another two coming in, one just came in, another one at the end of the year, and BREVIBLOC coming in September. Those numbers are baked into our forecast and estimates.","Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for you or maybe for Jay. At the Analyst Day you laid out your capital allocation plans, but even just since a few months ago, continue to generate strong free cash flow. That guidance is moving higher. Your stock price continues to move higher and so do other asset prices. So maybe in that context, give us your latest thoughts on how you plan to use your capital and maybe timing or expectations around that. Thanks a lot.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you, Robbie. Listen, our intention is, it's very easy to buy shares back and we have the cash and we've been doing a good job at that. But our intention, working very hard, is actually to deploy capital in acquisitions that will positively impact the business. And we have three thresholds that we have to cross when it comes to acquisitions. One is sustainable revenue growth. It has to be accretive to Baxter's growth at minimum, the strong market position and leadership, and accretive to Baxter current margins, and clear path to drive margin improvement.","So \u2013 and this is not about size. It can be a niche or it can be a large market company. We are looking at a significant amount of opportunities as we speak to expand Baxter's adjacencies and even looking at other opportunities that are at the moment variable. So we want to make sure that we deploy the capital with the returns that the market can count on Baxter to return. Our execution is starting to get really good. Even with the setback that we had on the 483 of Claris, we're executing on that business extremely well. Not only that, we not only covered a vast majority of the things that the FDA wrote us up for, but also, have improved significantly the operation and capacity at the plant and you can see, we're up 20% on sales that came into Baxter as an acquisition. The same thing with Mallinckrodt.","So we're starting to get the execution in Baxter now with an SG&A between 21% and 22% and probably next year going sub 21%. We will be able to integrate much better acquisitions in our systems and everything else. So we need into to find a good opportunity for Baxter. We're looking forward to do it, and we have the capacity and the capability to do so.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, good morning, everyone. So, maybe, Joe, just to start, if my math is correct here, it looks like the U.S. growth accelerated in the 2Q from the 1Q, so maybe just some thoughts on the U.S., how the environment feels?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","The environment is not bad. I think you still have low single digit growth, but consistent growth. We see no less admissions. You always have the seasonality in the mid of the summer, people will not voluntarily sometimes go through full procedures, and this is not a heavy time of the year primarily for most of the Baxter products which are related sometimes to flu and heavy hospitalization in general. But we see the U.S. market as a healthy, healthy market, with \u2013 continuing to see consolidation on the provider side, and I think a lot of movement in the payor provide area. So \u2013 but in terms of population, being treated is a healthy market and it's a good market to be part of.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. And then just the other question is clearly, new products are important for the second half of the year. I think that's embedded in your guidance that you'll start to see some revenues here. Can you just again give us some thoughts on the status of those new products? What are the drivers? And I would assume that it would be mostly weighted towards the fourth quarter. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yes. Let me start with the Kaguya launch in Japan. We are excited about that. We're slightly ahead of our plan, to the point that we had actually to accelerate some purchase of production equipment at our partner to be able to supply the market. So it is a super exciting market, Japan, because it's a high paying market with very, very low penetration of peritoneal dialysis, so we're starting to see some good movement there.","We just launched our Spectrum V9 in the U.S. We've converted one account, and a significant prospect of accounts coming up. So this is \u2013 our U.S. team, our Scott Luce and his team in the U.S. need to execute now in the second half, bringing new customers and some conversions to the table.","On the V9, Evo IQ, and \u2013 it's out new pump outside of the U.S., the first time in I think 15 or 17 years since we launched a new product outside of the U.S. when it comes to pumps. We're going to not only secure our current base of products in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, but we also plan to gain market share there. So we have now an install base of COLLEAGUE pumps, a name of the past that is still being used outside the U.S. And this product was launched in partnership with a company outside of the U.S. We were able to bring this product to the market with Baxter trademark points, meaning some of the features that we have in our pump is built into their product in 18 months.","So we're excited about that as well. We have PRISMAFLEX in Japan. We're now a comprehensive player in Japan. We also have Prismax in Europe in Q4, and more stuff coming in 2019. So we're excited about \u2013 this is a Baxter that we haven't seen in many years with so many launches. Now it's on us to execute.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, terrific, thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on Robbie's question regarding potential capital deployment and M&A. There's a lot of possible assets out there and potential adjacencies where you could fill some product gaps or potentially go even bigger. And I was just hoping to get a better sense from you guys on what does make the most sense strategic strategically as it relates to adjacencies? So some examples from the Analyst Day is you're getting back into nerve repair. Is it kind of building out specific areas like that? I mean, can you give any more color on where the priorities are as it relates to parts of the business from a BD perspective?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We have presented to you the adjacents that make sense to us, right? So we're strong in hospital. We're strong in home. So we have the channels. We have the key account management, but also, in terms of bringing synergies to the market, we have the capability now with one of the industry's lowest SG&A, okay. So I feel that we bring that part and we also bring the commercial ability to grow businesses.","We like parts of surgery, but more so we like hospital supplies. We also like some niche products into the doctor's office and areas that may bring some of our expertise in all these settings. So we now have some very interesting things that we're looking at. Some a little different than others, but it's not a lack of desire and a lack of opportunity. Now \u2013 and then boils down to value, and hopefully we can cross that bridge because value is one of the things that we continue to be focused on, despite the fact that we need to meet three criteria that I just outlined before at Robbie's question.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's fair, and just one follow up question on the long range plan as it relates to sales growth guidance and operating margin expansion. I mean, in this quarter you saw another nice step up in operational sales growth. Seems like you're heading in the right direction. Just wanted to get a feel from you on your confidence in achieving the long range plan based on these results, as this is the first quarter you've reported since updating that in May. Thanks so much, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you. Long range plan, as it says, is long range, so we still \u2013 we remain confident in our ability to meet those numbers, first of all. For several reasons I outlined a series of new products we're launching and our effectiveness in doing so. We also have market share leadership in many areas of care that we participate. So one quarter doesn't give you the right picture for the long arrangement, because if you think about the mix of products that Baxter's going to have in 2023, it's going to be different than what we have today. So it's going to be focused on 100 plus molecules in pharmaceuticals. It's going to have significant presence in the ICU. It's going to be in the specialty monitoring with our pumps. So things that we don't have today.","So our confidence in achieving the plan on the base business is solid. We have no questions about that. The part that we need to execute and we need to launch, and I'm feeling confident because the amount of products coming onto market is the technology and the innovation. And the third piece of it is really capital deployment, so we can get that thing done correctly and continue to augment, because I'm starting to feel more confident in our ability to take really tough stuff like Claris and turn things around, and actually use that asset as well as tuck-in acquisitions. But I feel comfortable with a solid confidence on our LRP.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Maybe just one quick one for Joe and then a follow up financial question for Jay. Joe, just coming back to Medication Delivery and the comments around customer acquisition speed, is the ability to acquire new customers or supply those new customers, is that being impacted in any way by better supply by competitors or any changing pricing dynamics in the saline market?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We'll start, David, from the end of your question. No, no price dynamics. These are long-term contracts. As a matter of fact, of the three GPOs that are in the market today, the largest ones, we have two already re-signed with us, and we're going to continue to re-sign customers under them, extending the longevity of these contracts. So \u2013 and the prices built in is a modest increase just to maintain with inflation or maintain up to a certain index. So it's not the pricing that will change the dynamics, at least in the next four to five years, because the contracts are five, and some have extensions built in that go up to seven.","The availability of other competitors, I would assume that one of the competitors, which had a significant issue with capacity will come back to the market. I don't doubt that, but the contracts are locked, so for us, right now, we're picking up beds that are available, but also importantly is to supply what most of you probably did not recognize is the large OEM opportunity that is out there, and we've just signed one not too long ago that brings a significant volume into Baxter from somebody else. And one that is locked is locked for many years.","So \u2013 and everything, David, has to do with consistency of manufacturing and distribution, and I feel absolutely comfortable with our plant in North Cove doing a wonderful job, really a wonderful job. A plant manager came in, Jon Rushford, about a year ago and has really transformed the culture of that place.","Secondly, getting the network in Latin America now to be flexible that I can ship into the U.S. if I need or I can revert back into Latin America or go to Europe if I need, and vice-versa. That creates a unique advantage to Baxter. Not putting any of our competitors down, but we bring a different dimension of supply stability and partnership to this market.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, Jay. Very clear, and then \u2013 sorry, okay, Joe. And Jay, just a couple of dynamics.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","I'm surprised that you confused our accents. Jay has a New York accent and I have a Brazilian accent.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, I hold you both at the high esteem; you're the same in my book. So a couple things, Jay, just on numbers here. So number one, just \u2013 you're seeing a benefit, obviously, of some customer or competitive disruption in BREVIBLOC and the OEM business. We have that as sort of two points in terms of growth impact this year. Kind of \u2013 is that close, Jay? And when can we think about those dynamics beginning to reverse?","And just a second, broader question, Jay, on guidance. Into the back half of the year, the 4% to 5% number, at the low end you have to have some modest acceleration to get there, obviously more at the higher end. Are you as confident at the higher end of the range here of 4% to 5% now as you were to begin the year? Those two. Thanks so much.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, certainly. On the guidance question, we are very confident in the guidance in the second half of the year. I think there's a few factors in play that sort of distort the quarters a little bit, one of which is the compounding that I referenced, one of which is the hurricane that I referenced. If you were to adjust for those items, really the piece that starts to contribute meaningfully are some of these new product launches, along with some of the customer gains that we started to see in the Medication Delivery business. So I think overall we feel quite good about it, and it's one of these areas where our line of sight to delivering the plan is as consistent as it's been.","On the BREVIBLOC item, certainly that was a contributor in the quarter. We saw maybe $15 million plus in terms of incremental BREVIBLOC sales above plan. We do expect this to subside, as we have a competitor entering in September. So \u2013 and there are some use cases for this particular product which we believe will abate over time, but that's been a factor \u2013 that was a factor in the quarter.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And Jay, just the OEM quantification on the OEM benefit?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","We don't really get into -","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And on the revenue?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, in terms of OEMs \u2013 oh, I'm sorry. So there's two different pieces, right. Joe referenced this concept of OEM, which is sales of IV bags to other institutions that are not necessarily hospitals, right. We're going to stop short of quantifying that particular item because from our standpoint, we don't want to get into specific customer dynamics.","As it relates to our other business, which did experience solid growth in the quarter, there were a number of factors going on with respect to what we call our B2B business, which is really contract manufacturing for others. We were able to generate a number of new customers, and then also we saw incremental volumes being sold to current customers. So again, good performance for us in the quarter from the \"Other\" business. It's something that we'll see some continued performance in that regard going forward.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, thank you guys. Joe, I wanted to come back to your earlier comments on the IV solutions' dynamic there, and the reason for asking is the marketplace \u2013 clearly, you guys have been able to bring back some capacity.","You mentioned the long-term contracting, but I'm curious if given the supply shocks that we saw last year, if the nature of some of these contracting terms have changed at all to maybe incentivize vendors to ensure capacity or supply \u2013 I'm sorry, supply in future crises. And to be fair (55:47) that might be an advantage you can take to the market; is that something that's helped you win business? And to the extent that you might have new competitors coming in down the road to help you maintain that share and pricing that you talked about? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Isaac, it's very relevant. As a matter of fact, I don't \u2013 I think all of our future contracts, there will be some kind of clause that has guarantee of certain volume or more penalties if you don't provide the volume. And we like that, and now we're in a comfortable position because I think spot market sellers are very opportunistic, but they may not be able to provide for the longer term. I think with us on the LVPs and the SVPs, we are getting to a lot of contracts that have that language.","I feel very comfortable on the LVPs. The SVPs, we're going to get more comfortable towards the end of the year and towards the mid to late 2019, we're going to have more Mini-Bag Plus capacity in a different location, as well \u2013 in two different locations; one coming up this December coming from Europe, and then one in the Americas, new capacity for Mini-Bag Plus that can be out there between Mini-Bag Plus and Mini-Bag.","So for us, having capacity and long-term contracts assure us in a tough, tough situation that happens more often than people think, which is tough \u2013 flu season is already hitting places like Brazil right now. We need to have solutions, and last year it was a good lesson, I think, for the industry and for us in terms of how to be more prepared and have contingencies in place.","We've been working very hard as well with the FDA to get redundancy for emergencies and things like that. But that plays a role in the contract because having that clause in the contract makes our customers more at ease with \u2013 in a situation of a crisis and allows us also to plan for the longer term.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on Claris. If I look at your comments in the 8-K regarding timeline, it looks like we have something like 6 months to 12 months before we'll get the next FDA inspection. Could you maybe just walk us through the top handful of priorities that you guys need to execute upon during that window to make sure that the next inspection goes well? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Well, we will not do anything much different than we've been doing in the last 12 months. We are relentless working in correcting all the observations by the FDA and things that we \u2013 as our Baxter quality system calls for, that was different before. So we are converting their documentation systems. We have rebuilt a significant amount of the plant. We have new air handling systems. We have a bunch of different things that we've been doing and preparing that plant really to be a great plant for Baxter. It is already doing well in terms of exceeding our expectations in sales in the short-term.","But we have a backup plan if we cannot get to the new molecules fast enough. We're looking for CMOs that will be able to come in and get the APIs in so we can finish the product someplace else. So we do have backup plans for that, but I have to say that our quality team led by Jackie Kunzler, our operations team by Scott Pleau, they are squarely focused in making sure that that plant will do the best it can to have a successful series of inspections by the FDA. Because it's not one inspection, you have to have a series of successful inspections so we can get into the launching product phase of the acquisition.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for taking the question. I'll keep it brief. First of all, Jay, can you quantify the impact on the P&L or the operating margins in the quarter from the recent acquisitions of Claris and also the Mallinckrodt products?","And then second one is a larger picture for you, Joe, is emerging markets. Anything new in terms of the approach there, or can you give us an update on that area? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Okay. Let me take the emerging markets first, and Jay will close the call answering your question. We right now are looking at emerging markets of close to 5% our outlook for the year with a significant \u2013 and good growth in China, close to 8%. Eastern Europe, over 6% and Emerging Asia, close to 5%. I think \u2013 don't forget, we call emerging markets, but those are 23% of our sales, okay. So they're not as emerging as one may think.","I'm particularly happy with China. I think China is a place that we haven't spoken much about. We talk a lot about Japan, but China is a country that within our long range plan we will exceed $1 billion, and we feel excited about that business. So I think the two-invoice system in China and how some changes in regulatory in China are not concerning, but are watch outs, but I think those are the things that the industry and us will overcome. It's still a significant opportunity. It's still a great market, and I think Baxter is well positioned because it has a strong team in China. So great leadership there. As a matter of fact, we're going to be there next week doing a Growth Summit to make sure we can get even more growth and new white space opportunities within our Chinese group.","So now, Jay?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, great. Thanks, Joe. Overall we're pleased with the performance, as Joe mentioned earlier, of both of the acquisitions, the Claris acquisition and the Mallinckrodt. In the quarter, those two acquisitions contributed approximately $0.02 and maybe improved the operating margin of the company about 10 basis points, although there may be some rounding in that. It's a small amount. But from an overall standpoint, sales moving ahead in line with our expectations, and then the EPS impact very much in line with how we thought about these transactions earlier in the year.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Jos\u00e9 E.

Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Candace. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer; and Brik Eyre, President, Americas.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter 2018 financial results along with our updated financial outlook for 2018. A supplemental presentation to complement this morning's discussion can be accessed on our website. This presentation, along with related non-GAAP reconciliations, can be accessed on Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events & News.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And, of course, our actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth with adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for cyclophosphamide in the U.S. and approximately one month of sales from the acquisition of Claris in July 2017, along with our acquisition of two surgical products from Mallinckrodt in the first quarter of 2018.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. I will begin with some comments and perspective on our third quarter results. Jay will then walk through the financials and guidance in greater detail and we will close with your questions. Brik Eyre, whom may you know from our many investor conferences, will join us for the Q&A to provide additional insights on our U.S. performance.","Baxter reported solid third quarter with sales up 2% on a reported basis, 3% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, increasing 25% year-over-year. Our strong earnings growth demonstrates the continued power of our operational improvement initiatives, and we see more potential for these efforts moving forward.","Drivers of growth in the quarter included the company's Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, Advanced Surgery and Acute Therapies businesses; increased demand for Baxter's contract manufacturing services also contributed to the performance in the quarter. This strength helped offset declines in our Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses.","Growth in Renal Care was primarily driven by increased patient volumes for our peritoneal dialysis products globally. In the U.S. this contributed double-digit PD therapy growth. In Asia Pacific we continue to see strong patient growth in China. And for the first time in years, we're experiencing positive patient growth in Japan following the launch of Kaguya earlier this year.","In Pharmaceuticals, growth was driven by strength in the U.S. where we've experienced increased demand for our premixed injectables and extended our portfolio with addition of Claris products. Claris, which we'll now refer to as Baxter Ahmedabad, continues to deliver double-digit performance growth in line with our expectations.","Increased sales of anesthesia and critical care products also contribute to the results in the quarter. Advanced Surgery achieved double-digit growth including a contribution of $14 million from sales of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK.","Acute Therapies also reported double-digit sales growth based on global strength across the portfolio. On Monday, this team initiated a worldwide launch of the leading-edge PrisMax system, beginning with 19 European countries.","PrisMax is our next-generation technology for CRRT or continuous renal replacement therapy in organ support therapies. It offers ICU practitioners a broad range of advantages designed to make therapies simpler, safer, more accurate and more efficient. This is transformative innovation that builds on decades of Baxter market leadership in the acute care space.","The strong results posted by this business was partially offset by performance in our U.S. Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses, which were frankly disappointing. I can assure you that steps are already being taken to address these issues.","It starts with decisive actions to put the right leadership in place, accountable for renewing the strategic momentum and forecast reliability that we and you expect. Overall, we remain on sound footing across a vast portfolio of products with market leadership positions. To be certain, we are in a period of course correction in a few key areas which we often occurs from time to time in a dynamic market like ours.","Let me drill down a few key areas starting with supply disruption due to Hurricane Maria. It has now become clear that market dynamics have fundamentally shifted in a few of our market segments in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, at least in the near to mid-term. While we have resumed production at pre-hurricane levels, the gap in bringing supply back to market ultimately cause a longer-lasting ripple effect for several products line. End customer demand has now fully resumed to prior levels.","Specifically, with respect to small volume parenterals which include our MINI-BAG and MINI-BAG Plus lines, we have seen impacts from protocol changes such as moving to IV push for administration of drugs, as well as some moves to competitive products and supply constrained codes.","While we expect to regain most of this business, we do anticipate it will take some time, particularly for the portion of the business that has moved to alternative practices for drug administration. We are continuing to reinforce the benefits of MINI-BAG Plus, emphasizing safety and reduced potential for medication errors. We're also reinforcing the availability of supply with our customers.","For select U.S. nutrition products, we've seen some market contraction as a result of hurricane-related supply constraints, whether through providers delaying the start of parenteral nutrition and\/or reducing dosage. We also experienced some shifts to outsource the nutrition compounding centers and competitive products.","It is unlikely we'll regain all our lost sales here, particularly where we've seen market contraction, at least in the near to mid-term. We're in process of rebasing this business and expect to resume U.S. market growth of low single digits in the coming quarters.","And while not directly related to the hurricane's impact on our production levels, the historic tight supply in the market for IV solutions has also impacted performance for the Medication Delivery business this year. Sales of large-volume IV solutions spiked in the first five months of the year, driven by increased purchases, given the protracted industry-wide supply challenges, coupled with an intense flu season.","Customers rushed to acquire any available IV solutions products. This resulted in growing inventory levels across our customer base. Our forecast was built off this elevated run rate and didn't contemplate the level of inventory destocking we're currently experience as supply constraints have eased.","In addition, the timing of having incremental beds in non-acute customer has fallen short of our expectations. It's important to note that the end user demand for our LVPs is up approximately 2% year-to-date. We believe this is slightly ahead of the market which we see as growing approximately 1%.","So ultimately, while our overall share has remained stable, the impact from the inventory destocking as well as the timing of bringing on new customers has clearly been slower than anticipated. As a result of these market dynamics, we are resetting expectation for these businesses in 2018.","Going forward, our expectation is that the Medication Delivery and Nutrition business will grow in line with our long-term outlook. Taken together, these learnings will help support greater predictability and forecast alignment. We have a unique portfolio of life-sustaining products and we've implemented some necessary changes that we believe will make our prospect both stronger now and over the long run.","In summary, our diversified portfolio, accelerating innovation, strong balance sheet and relentless focus on operational efficiency give us the confidence and flexibility to deliver on our long-term financial objectives.","With that, I will turn it over to Jay.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, although we've experienced challenging market dynamics in select businesses, our third quarter results reflect the benefit of our diversified portfolio as well as our ongoing commitment to accelerating bottom line growth. I'll start by discussing our third quarter results before providing our updated financial outlook for 2018.","Beginning with the third quarter, global sales of $2.8 billion increased 2% on a reported basis, 3% at constant currency and 3% on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 25% to $0.80 per diluted share. This exceeded our previous guidance of $0.72 to $0.74 per share, driven by solid operational performance and ongoing benefit from our business transformation initiatives and the lower tax rate.","Now, I'll walk you through performance by our regions and global business units. Note, for this quarter, constant currency sales growth is equal to operational sales growth for all businesses with the exception of our Pharmaceuticals and Advanced Surgery business. For these businesses, we will provide operational growth.","Starting first with sales growth for our three regions. Sales in the Americas advanced 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 4%, both constant currency and operationally. And finally, sales in our Asia Pacific region were flat on both a constant currency and operational basis.","As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2017 we recorded $25 million of sales in our international compounding business due to an early contract settlement with one of our Australian hospital pharmacy customers, which impacted growth in the Asia Pacific region by approximately 4%.","Moving on to performance by global business units. Global sales for Renal Care were $910 million, advancing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance was driven by mid-single-digit growth for PD therapies globally, as well as low-single-digit growth globally for our in-center HD business.","Sales in Medication Delivery were $652 million, down 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by the business dynamics that Joe walked through earlier. Pharmaceutical sales were $519 million, increasing 5% constant currency and 5% operationally. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from strength in our anesthesia business and increased demand for Baxter's injectable premixed drugs. Sales of U.S. cyclo were $40 million in the quarter and global Claris sales were $38 million.","Moving to Nutrition. Total sales were $218 million, down 2% on a constant currency basis. Solid growth in international markets was offset by lower sales in the U.S., which Joe commented on earlier. Sales in Advanced Surgery were $200 million, increasing 15% constant currency and 7% operationally. As Joe mentioned, sales of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK contributed approximately $14 million in the quarter.","Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $122 million, representing growth of 10% on a constant currency basis, continuing the trajectory of delivering double-digit growth, driven by increased global demand for Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapies.","Finally, sales in our other category, which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services, were $146 million, an increase of 17% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was primarily driven by increased demand for our contract manufacturing services, specifically our cytotoxic contract manufacturing services, as well as incremental production volumes for seasonal vaccines.","Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 46.3% increased 100 basis points over the prior year, benefiting from favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted SG&A totaled $622 million, decreasing 1% on a reported basis and flat on a constant currency basis.","We continue to see a positive contribution from our relentless focus on effective expense management and business transformation initiatives, which helped to offset the loss of approximately $10 million in transition service income from Shire and incremental expenses related to our recent acquisitions.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $153 million increased 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year period, as we continue to invest in high-impact programs to accelerate innovation at the company. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 18.3%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Growth was driven by strong operational expansion as well as continued effective expense management.","Net interest expense was $11 million in the third quarter, reflecting higher levels of interest income due to rising interest rates and other income totaled $32 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a benefit from the recent changes we made to our U.S. pension plan, along with foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions.","The adjusted tax rate was 17.1% for the quarter, which includes a benefit of $9 million from stock compensation. This came in favorable to our expectations, driven primarily by certain discrete items recorded in the quarter.","And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.72 to $0.74 per share. During the quarter we repurchased $247 million or 3.3 million shares of Baxter stock. These repurchases were partially offset by option-related dilution in the quarter.","Before turning to 2018 outlook, I will briefly comment on our cash flow performance. In the first three quarters of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $873 million with improvement in net income offset by higher inventory levels as we worked to rebuild supply for select products to ensure adequate product availability.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. Given the market dynamics we discussed for our U.S. Medication Delivery and Nutrition business, we've lowered our sales forecast for the year. Globally we now expect 2018 full-year sales to increase approximately 5% on a reported basis. We now expect growth of approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and approximately 3% on an operational basis.","Moving to full-year guidance by business on a constant currency and operational basis, except where otherwise noted. In Renal Care we continue to expect growth of 3% to 4%. In Medication Delivery, we now expect sales to decline low single digits. We now expect our Pharmaceuticals business to increase high single digits at constant currency.","This assumes 2018 U.S. cyclo sales of $160 million, above previous guidance of $130 million. We continue to expect full-year Claris sales of approximately $145 million. Adjusting for cyclo and the first seven months of Claris, we now expect operational sales to increase approximately 7%.","Moving to Nutrition, we now expect sales to decline low single digits. For our Advanced Surgery business, we now expect sales to increase approximately 10% on a constant currency basis. This includes a contribution of approximately $45 million related to the acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK. Excluding the impact of these sales, operational growth is expected to be approximately 4%.","For the Acute Therapies business, we now anticipate growth of 10% to 11%. Finally, in our other business, we now expect growth of high single digits, given increased demand for our contract manufacturing services.","Moving down the P&L. We now anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. We expect net interest expense of approximately $45 million and other income of approximately $105 million for 2018.","For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17%. For full-year 2018, we anticipate a diluted average share count between 545 million to 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we expect 2018 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.98 to $3 per diluted share.","Finally for the year, we now expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, with capital expenditures of approximately $700 million and free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion, down slightly from our previous guidance due to higher inventory levels.","Specific to the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and between 3% and 4% on both a constant currency and operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.71 to $0.73 per share.","That concludes my comments. We can now open the call for Q&A. As a reminder, also on the call today is Brik Eyre, President, Americas, to join us during the Q&A. Candace?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We appreciate everyone's patience and would like to provide as many of you as possible with the opportunity to ask a question. We'll pause for a moment while the list is being compiled. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.","And our first question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thank you and good morning.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Morning, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So thanks for taking the question. I guess my concern looking at the last two quarters is that at least some of the issues that you're facing seem a bit structural given that you're experiencing share loss and a move to some alternative, cheaper technology. So I guess my question is this: can you quantify for us or describe the degree to which you think you're losing share here and then help us understand how these issues could impact growth into 2019?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Okay. Bob, I'm going to pick up half of the answer here and I'm going to pass to Brik to get a little bit more color on the question on the share. First of all, there were shifts in the market, because us not having MINI-BAGS and MINI-BAG Plus and amino acids. We actually were the ones teaching our customers how to use alternative methods. Some of them will come back and we expect in 2019 to pick up a portion of that without a problem.","The other ones will take a little longer for us to convert, because those are medical practices. You have a significant amount of hospitals in the country and we have large market share. I would say that, we don't see the issues that we experienced in 2018 by rebasing 2018 to affect tremendously growth rates going forward.","So as a matter of fact, I would say that the full year of 2018, the results are the base for the LRP that we present in May, which runs from 18 to 23. So using the projected performance of 2018 that we just shared with you, we are not revising our long-term guidance for total Baxter, either the top or bottom line.","So there are structural issues that take a little longer to resolve, but we have not lost any customers at this moment. And we may have lost some temporary share in accounts where some fluids are being substituted which we expect from the mid to long term to recapture. I'd like to see if Brik would like to add anything to it.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks Joe. Bob, let me talk about a couple of segments of the business. So first our small-volume parenterals. So these are 50-, 100-, 150-milliliter bags that are used to administer, infuse medication to patients. In that segment, when there were no products that our customers could find, about 25% of the doses that have historically been used or been administered through infusion using our MINI-BAG and MINI-BAG Plus products, had to find other ways to administer those drugs.","A portion of that went through a new practice which is IV push. Now to be clear, IV push happens in every hospital every day across the country, typically in OR drugs, et cetera. But in this particular case when there was no product, specifically cephalosporins, penicillins, those anti-infectives were moved to an IV push. This practice is, the nurse literally takes a syringe and dilutes the drug into 5 ml, 10 ml worth of diluent and then injects it into a port that is at the hand where there's access to the vein. And then they will do that over a period of time.","There are some safety concerns, et cetera, that we are talking with our customers, but some customers have moved to IV push. And in so doing, they have to change their protocol. They changed their protocol, they changed their system, et cetera. So while we do believe we will get this back, it's taking a little bit more time than we had anticipated.","Other customers went to competitive products. We actually feel very confident that we will get those products back and we're working with our customers now to ensure that they understand that we have capacity, supply, et cetera.","Now the other component of this is Nutrition that was impacted from the hurricane perspective. The Nutrition business actually did contract, the market contracted. Whereas Joe mentioned in the opening comments, when customers didn't have product, they delayed start times, et cetera. So believe the overall nutrition market has contracted about 7%.","We have also lost some share, because we didn't have product and we are working again with customers to get that share back. So while we don't think it's a long-term piece, certainly over the next few quarters we anticipate seeing a ramp-up of bringing those products back to us. But anything that required a change in protocol will take a little bit more time.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the clarity there. Just a very brief follow-up. Joe, is now the right time to be more aggressive with the balance sheet relating to buyback, given your confidence that these things will be temporary?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","I would say that with the capacity that we have and we're going to look at the sentiment of the investors, it's always a good time at this moment to look at some buybacks. But also, we continue to use a significant amount of efforts inside Baxter in the M&A space.","So we want to make sure that we have capacity to do all the above, continue to increase our dividends annually and buy back shares and have plenty capacity to go after M&A targets which has a renewed and very focused effort at Baxter.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe, just going back to Bob's question on some of the disruptions you guys have had. And this is a little unusual for you guys, where the Street's gotten used to stellar execution. So I just want to understand the dynamics, right?","So you had \u2013 I think Joe you mentioned LVP. So if I'm understanding what happened on the LVP side is customers pre-bought, as in, they built up inventories. One, how long does it take for them to work through those inventories? Should we still be expecting impact in first half of 2019?","And then back to, I guess, Brik's sort of \u2013 Brik, thanks for that explanation on the push syringe impact. But I would think like, I mean, for 50 ml to 100 ml bags, someone pushing in, using an IV push, that's a lot of inconvenience from a time, use of time perspective in the hospital for the nurse. I'm just trying to think whether all of that comes back, or if the assumptions around why some of that may not come back.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Vijay, good morning. So I'm going to have Brik answer 95% of your question. Just want to go back to the LVP. We now have a very good understanding of what happened in terms of stocking and destocking. As I said, we haven't lost a customer, but what we learned from this whole thing was that there was a pattern of purchases that were, for many years, in place due to product allocation that customers would buy whatever was available for them to buy, because was usually a little less than they would wish to purchase.","We have created significant flexibility in the supply chain. And for the first time we are in the market with no allocation which creates flexibility for us not to sell in U.S., but sell the product in other parts of Latin America like we just did the other day in Mexico; extremely well-executed flexibility in supply chain.","So we are going into a new era of LVPs where not only our plant in North Cove has done extremely well remediating and improving the output of the plant. So at the same time, we're resolving long-lasting quality issues. Things of the past are being resolved effectively.","That plant is also now surpassing capacity plans, because it's doing so well. We have capacity in Mexico, Ireland. So we now have the ability to really put the product to work. And this will be fundamentally important for us to re-sign customers up where we signed in the past.","So we talk about execution. We had an execution issue in the short term by having a team that did not understand what was happening with the difference between inventory, end distributor and demand at the end of the day. It didn't change the dynamics. We did not see the signal and we should have seen that and communicated more effectively.","So to that end, we are relentless in execution. That's why we made significant changes in the U.S. team and have replaced people, in process of replacing people who did not understand how we operate. I want to pass on to Brik to speak specifically about the push and how this business can come back in terms of market share as well.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","So Vijay, thank you. I just want to make sure I'm clear. In the package insert for administration of a ceph or a pen, for example, there's a couple ways that they can do that. They can put it into a MINI-BAG and infuse it over 30, 45 minutes of an infusion or \u2013 and that would be like 100 ml. Or you can inject it driving push with 5 ml to 10 ml of diluent. And so, they're not doing an IV push of 100 ml. It is 5 ml to 10 ml. Now, they will do that over a three to five minute period of time. It will say in the package insert how long they should wait.","The practical reality is studies have shown that a lot of times they don't wait that long to push it and so there could be an overprescription, overdosing and there could be a medication error. And that's one of the things that we're talking to our customers about.","So IV push, the issue really is they're comfortable with IV push for certain drugs, but those drugs that can be infused, cephs, pens, et cetera, really the best way to administer that drug is through MINI-BAGS, and that's what we're talking to our customers about.","Now I might take just a moment on LVPs to add just a little bit of color. This has been a business that's been highly successful for us for a number of years and it's driven tremendous, tremendous growth. And the vast majority of that comes from new customer sign-ups.","As you know, over the last five or six years, we've actually signed up to three- to five-year contracts about 100,000 beds. So tremendous market shifts over the last five, six years in our business from an LVP perspective. And that has been \u2013 that coupled with an industry challenge in supply, our customers virtually purchase almost everything we could produce.","In fact, these products have been on allocation. So we allocated a number of units that each customer could buy based on historical performance, because we had to do that to make sure that we got product to every customer.","As we discussed and as Joe just discussed, as we brought more product from Latin America, we were able to increase the allocation to customers above their historical usage, and ultimately to remove that. As we did that, the demand for our products was tremendous in the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter as customers were concerned, and distributors as well, were concerned about the hurricane disruption of the market in general, as well as products that have just been on allocation for a long time, exacerbated with a larger flu impact that we had earlier this year. So there was tremendous, tremendous demand for our product.","And then our U.S. team took that run rate on product that has always been able to -whatever we manufacture, people purchased over the last five years because of allocation and used that for our forecast the back half of the year. And they did so not realizing that distributors and customers purchase significantly over the end user demand the first half, most notably in the first quarter as I mentioned.","Now the good news is that those distributors have worked through that inventory. Caused a significant impact in the third quarter, but we believe that we are close to being back into equilibrium. We've been in contact with our distributors, our wholesalers. We know our end user demand. We get tracings from our distributors. So we really improved our analytical capabilities and certainly we will be at equilibrium over the next couple of months.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's extremely helpful, Brik. And maybe, Jay, just on the margin front, that was a stellar standout, right, in terms of the positives. Irrespective of what the top line was, I mean, you guys have executed on margins. But as we \u2013 it looks like maybe Q4, maybe there are some below-the-line items impacting. I'm having a little bit of a hard time getting to the low end of that EPS guide range. And when we look at 2019 just qualitatively, should we be assuming some of these revenue headwinds persist? But on the margin front, the guide that you guys laid out at the Analyst Day, nothing changes on the margin front. Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure. Vijay, let me talk a little bit about Q4 and our expectations there because to your point, while in second half of the year we were pleased to be able to confirm the overall guidance at the high end of the range, you point out very accurately that the Q4 implied guidance is down relative to what we previously shared.","There's a few factors in play here, the largest of which is this issue that we've highlighted and discussed extensively about Medication Delivery and Nutrition. Overall, as we think about the impact in the fourth quarter relative to our prior expectations, that's about $0.06 of impact.","Now offsetting that is savings initiatives that we have in place, roughly $0.01; cyclophosphamide impacts approximately $0.03. And then there are a couple of financial adjustments, or financial items I should say, related to foreign exchange and tax. We have taken \u2013 we reduced our expectations with respect to FAS 123R, so you do see a bit of tax uptick. But in combination, foreign exchange and other financial items impact us roughly $0.04 in the quarter. So in combination, all of those items take us roughly down $0.05 midpoint to midpoint in the fourth quarter.","As it relates to 2019, we'll stop short of giving guidance for that today. We do believe that there's real opportunity to recover and I think Brik has discussed that extensively as has Joe. But as far as specific guidance for 2019, we'll stop short of that. We have reiterated confidence in the long-range plan that we shared which shares through 2023 with also 2020 numbers.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about some of the businesses that did well in the quarter, particularly Acute Therapies and Pharmaceuticals. These are ones where we've seen trends progressing positively each quarter. Can you help us understand Pharmaceuticals, what's driving that, how sustainable it is? And then in Acute Therapies, there were some new product launches recently. Can you help us understand the impact from those going forward?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Can you repeat the second part of the question? I understood the Pharmaceuticals. I missed....","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Acute Therapies and new product launches.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Acute Therapies, okay. Robbie, we had an extraordinary performance in the Pharmaceuticals business. Some of that is our capability of producing products that others can't and being there all the time. Cyclophosphamide is one of them despite the fact there's the new competitor that was authorized by the FDA to produce. We haven't seen the product coming out of this manufacturer yet. It's a very difficult product to make. We're not saying that we're the only ones who can because there's another competitor in the market. Sandoz has their product out there.","But at the end of the day, we can make oncolytics and cytotoxics extremely well, one of the best in the market. We have BREVIBLOC that we do well and also TDS which we source and be able to have the product for our customers. We don't see these products repeating the same performance all the time because as the nature of the business being when we can produce then people can't, people sometimes come back to the market. BREVIBLOC is one that now has couple other manufacturers on the market, but we are always hedging our capabilities. So the performance of the Pharmaceuticals have been driven primarily by our ability to execute versus others who can't.","I will give you a little bit of a mid to long-term view of Pharmaceuticals. It's just our ability to continue to look into acquiring molecules which we've been doing. Second is our commitment to deliver on the LRP that Brik had presented at the Investor Day. We are still on track for all of that.","Moving to the Acute Therapies, and then I just want to say that we just launched PrisMax. Great product, launch in Europe. It's going to launch in the U.S. following. We are very excited. We're number one in this therapy around the globe. You can see by the performance of this business and the performance of a competitor that just released earnings the other day, specifically yesterday, that we continue to be very successful in gaining share and also creating adoption for this technology. Just this proves this is a structurally sound business and we're very happy with the execution.","I just also want to take the opportunity to mention things are going well to underscore our launch of PD business and a relaunch of our PD business in Japan with great success and a 10% growth overall in China on all of our businesses combined. So we have some really good stuff happening. The unfortunate part is that we've missed some of the market signals in the U.S. that created a headwind for us in Q3. (41:27) create in Q4 and we'll recover probably through 2019 into 2020. So we have some really good businesses within the company. They are really good cash generators and also we have a good and sound pipeline coming out on the company in 2019 and 2020.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And I know there've been a couple questions on Medication Delivery, but just to look at it from a different angle; I haven't heard anything in terms of how infusion systems have done in the quarter year-to-date. Maybe how that's playing out with the systems you launch. And then also can you comment on large volume pricing? You've said that volumes were up 2% year-to-date. How does the pricing situation look for first half and then versus third quarter? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Robbie, just want to amend my answer on Pharmaceuticals. There are premixes which are replacements for me \u2013 we would sell premixes every day of the week in detriment of MINI-BAG Plus, okay? Because premix carry higher margin and they're up 18%, and they're reflected in Pharmaceuticals. They're not reflected in SVPs. Just want to highlight that because I missed that in my answer to you. So to the folks on the call, premix has done extremely well, just the GALAXY product and those were ones that we told the customers to substitute for when we did not have MINI-BAG Plus available after the hurricane. So this is the positive side that we did not talk about. Let me pass on to Brik to answer the rest of your question.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","So Robbie, relative to pricing with LVPs, nutrition et cetera, the reality is these are products that are on longer term contracts that have modest price increases built into those contracts. So pricing remains in line with our expectation across all of those product lines.","Relative to infusion pumps, we continue to believe that we will pick up approximately 1% of market share this year in the United States with our Sigma Spectrum pump. We have found that as more customers desire to have auto programming, one of the key features of our new pump that we've recently launched, our Spectrum IQ, which we sometimes referred to as version nine and other integrated features, the selling cycle has lengthened a little bit.","And so IT is now involved at a much higher level, at a hospital level or at a hospital \u2013 in each of our hospitals. And so we did reduce our pump number a little bit in the back half as products slip out into next year. But overall we anticipate picking up the one percentage point as we had suggested earlier on with the new launch of Sigma Spectrum.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Morning.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe, Jay, just start \u2013 morning, guys. Just start, Jay, with you a question on free cash. Just free cash flow growth reversed a bit second quarter to third quarter. So I imagine there's been some supply chain reinvestment. Could you just walk us through second quarter to third quarter? And as you think about, so next year, do you think free cash flow gets back to that historical double-digit growth rate?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, look, thinking about overall performance from a free cash flow, year-over-year, I think we're still talking about north of 20% growth, so very solid growth from 2017 to 2018. You'll recall earlier in the year we raised free cash flow guidance. We have subsequently lowered it. And really what that has to do with is a couple of the factors that we discussed during this call. One is to the extent that you fall short on a sales forecast, it's very difficult to adjust your supply chain planning such that there's not an inventory build that takes place.","The second thing is we're very pleased with the performance coming out of our North Cove manufacturing facility but that has been overproducing in terms of getting fully back up to speed ahead of our expectations which is another factor contributing a bit to the inventory build. And then as we said earlier, when we look at year-over-year performance, we did make some strategic decisions to make select product inventory builds. So really, those are the three factors that we see. We do not see this as a structural issue. And frankly, once we kind of tighten up our forecast going into next year, this will be an opportunity for us to claw this back.","So this year, if we think about the progression of free cash flow, we've gone from $300 million in 2015 to $1.5 billion in 2018. Inherently, and when you see that kind of extraordinary growth, there will be some volatility and some puts and takes. We wanted to make sure we share, obviously, the most updated thinking in terms of where we see this landing. But like I say, I don't believe this is structural issue that we're faced with and we will plan accordingly as we look to next year.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jay. And just maybe two quick follow-ups. The first is for Joe or for Brik. We haven't heard a lot about the SVP manufacturing dynamics in Puerto Rico. How do they trend here in the third quarter and what's the pathway to approval? Then Jay, sorry. Just for the fourth quarter assumptions, we have two different dynamics: inventory and some of these customer changing dynamics. Inventory is you can look at tracing data and get relatively comfortable. Just basically trying to ask, as it relates to customer recapture rates, how risk-adjusted are these fourth quarter numbers? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks so much, guys.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","So let me first talk a little bit about SVP, David. Our production level is back where we want, need it to be, et cetera. We were able to put MINI-BAGs back in the channel kind of mid-July, so mid-summer, and we're starting to see an impact of having that back in the channel which is a good thing as customers can buy from their primary distributors.","MINI-BAG Plus just went back into the channel in September. We are healthy on most codes of MINI-BAG Plus. We've got one or two codes that we're still getting healthy on, but the vast majority of our business, we're very healthy now from a inventory perspective and we are working, again, diligently with our customers relative to ensure that they have confidence in our ability to supply.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","And then, David, from a fourth quarter financial forecast, we've spent a lot of time with a bonds up build up, trying to be appropriately conservative as we look across the portfolio. And that includes LVPs. That includes SVP recapture and so on. And so I think we've got the right number as we look to Q4 in the guidance that we shared.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","The only other thing I might add, David, is we have launched a new product which is sourced out of Castlebar, which is a single-pack MINI-BAG Plus product, which we're really excited about. From an operational efficiency perspective in the hospital, it's been very, very well received. And so this continues to diversify our risk as we have other sites manufacturing this MINI-BAG Plus product that is such a great product for us.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much, guys.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on the P&L, one on capital deployment. So Jay, in the past you've been very helpful in pointing out kind of headwinds in the subsequent year and you guys have been very good at being able to overcome those headwinds on the P&L. So for 2019, you have currency, cyclo BREVIBLOC, maybe on other income and tax, potentially as headwinds. And in the aggregate, by our math could reduce 2019 EPS by about $0.40. So can you walk us through some of the P&L headwinds next year and help us understand if you can still grow EPS at a double-digit reported rate in 2019? And I had one follow-up.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Larry, stay tuned. Come join us on I think January 31 or February 1 for guidance for 2019. At this stage, I think it's premature. What we've said is we've shared financial guideposts for 2020 and 2023. There are numerous puts and takes of which we've confirmed and feel confident in. There are numerous puts and takes as we look at any given year, and our objective is to do as well as we possibly can do in any given year. And so certainly things like new product launches are things that we'll highlight as we come to our earnings call at the beginning of next year. But like I say, it's too premature to give 2019 guidance at this point.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. And Joe, regarding M&A at our healthcare conference, Jay, not to get you in trouble but you said Baxter is agnostic to deal size which surprised me a little bit. So Joe I thought you had a strong preference for smaller deals because it was hard to get a good ROIC from larger deals. So my question is has anything changed? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you. Trying to figure out if Jay and I are on the same page and we are actually. Jay called me right before he said that, said, can I say that and I authorize him to say that without being present. We are looking at any opportunity that we have, either adjacent to the core or completely outside of the core in terms of another leg to the stool. And why do we take the constrain of size? Because that creates an issue in selecting targets. Not necessarily that we will execute on them, but being agnostic of size what, Jay meant to say was that we are looking at every opportunity that will get us what we need to do which is to refresh the portfolio of Baxter to create momentum on the gross margin line, augment growth on the top line and be accretive to the bottom line. We're doing this. And by taking the size from the restriction, we can see better what's available to us.","But let me also put a commentary that was implied in Jay's response to your question during your conference. That is, we will push the boundaries of our debt ratio to the limit of investment grade but not go below that. So that creates a size limitation of what we can do okay? Secondly, I have to say to you that what Baxter has done in terms of its business transformation and why we're able to bring to the company when I first started about exactly three years ago yesterday, we had 9% of operating income and now we are above 18% of operating income. That transformation of a company is difficult to achieve. But once you know and learn how to do it, it is paramount on the acquisitions.","So if you think about when we talk about sizes and how we do it, it's not about integration per se but it's our ability also to go in with that mentality, with that trademark and get the savings out of the target independently, if the synergies are all in terms of connecting systems and doing the stuff that more traditional people think about. I'm coming from a different angle that said that is doable, but the first thing we'll do, we'll put a business transformational office identical to what we have in Baxter at that company. And we're going to remove the cost in this path that companies usually have in the medical technology and generics pharmaceutical business.","So, it's a long answer to you to say that we are looking at multiple size deals. We're looking for in also adjacencies and outside of our space within the healthcare, but also we have the ability to really be a cost-driven organization that can extract value from a target, even if it's not core or highly synergistic to us.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just wanted to \u2013 we've obviously spent a lot of time on LVPs and SVPs, but wanted to come back to nutrition and just get some thoughts as it relates to sort of the protocols changing in terms of delayed starts for nutritional products. How do you influence that to kind of go back to where it was? Because I guess my concern is that could become a bit more permanent.","Brik V. Eyre - Baxter International, Inc.","So, Larry let me take that if I can. Certainly it's more problematic when protocols change. But ASPEN, The American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, wrote some guidelines to help people when they were in conservation mode. There are guidelines for feeding. And while these patients are typically really, really sick, they don't have gut function; that is why they're on parenteral nutrition. So, it's very difficult to be able to track specifically what the clinical outcome is to \u2013 there are so many different inputs.","But if you take a step back, we do know and there's good data that would suggest that outcomes are better when a patient is nourished appropriately and effectively. So, we are working with all of the societies now that there's an appropriate supply to see if we can't help customers go back to feeding protocols that have been established by ASPEN here in the U.S., by ESPEN which is in Europe, to help make sure that patients are fed appropriately.","We'll continue to work with those societies, continue to work with our customers. But as you mentioned, when a protocol changes in the hospital, it just takes a little bit more time to get it back. We're working very closely with our customers and they do recognize the importance of feeding. And we just have to make sure that they're confident in our supply chain and the supply chain of the market in total.","And to your point and just from a framing perspective, about 7% of the market contracted and we will be working over the next several quarters to bring that back.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then two other perhaps quick ones. I think, Joe, you may have mentioned in your prepared comments about some management changes following some of the forecasting missteps, if you will, relative to the business. So, again, I want to make sure I heard that and kind of what the plans are there. And then for Jay, just on the gross margin expansion year-over-year which was clearly impressive, just trying to understand the components that drove that expansion if there any one-timers there. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We always look at execution at Baxter in a way that is pretty straightforward. Some stuff we expect from people to accomplish at a certain level. Understanding their market's the first one. So, when people don't understand their markets or they have been complacent in doing their jobs, it's our responsibility as leaders to identify that, either correct with the personnel that we have or just replace.","So that's what we did. And we do that all the time in all businesses. We have significant changes. For instance, we made significant change in the international business of Baxter. Was really under-managed to be honest with you, and we brought some really good people in and we start seeing the performance going up. Brik had issues with the performance in the hospital business in the U.S. and we just did the same thing. So it's pretty straightforward. No different than I would have done in any other prior jobs, but we take performance very seriously. We take performance as the number one criteria only second to ethics and compliance.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","As it relates to gross margin, which was a bright spot in the quarter, the lion's share of the improvements relate to cost initiatives and business transformation. As Joe mentioned, the margin journey that we're on is something that initially was focused primarily on SG&A as that was the fastest area to take out. But now under the leadership of Scott Pleau, we've been able to make changes to our operations network, to facilities, to optimizing within facilities. So probably 75% of our margin improvement year-over-year relates to some of these cost initiatives. And perhaps 25% or so relates to mix and operational growth that took place in the quarter. So, on balance, as we look from 2018 to 2023, you can expect to see more progress driving cost out with a lot of that coming from the gross margin line in the coming years.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. There are a number of new products that you're launching right now in the second half that should benefit you in 2019: Spectrum IQ, Evo IQ, PRISMAFLEX, PrisMax. Can you give us a brief update on how those products are rolling out the door and how we should think about them ramping into next year to possibly offset some of the continued nutritionals and Medication Delivery recovery?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah. Joanne, clearly we are looking into 2019 to be a year that we're going to have growth. The question that we're going to tell you how much the growth is going to be is going to be a conversation in January. Those products will contribute and we're counting on them to help because, as you see, some of this change that Brik just mentioned in nutrition is several quarters in the making to recoup that kind of a sales volume.","So those new products will be key. We're counting on PrisMax. I think dexmed [dexmedetomidine] is one that we're very excited. Once we launch that, is actually doing very well. We have four new molecules launching next year as well. So one thing we have proven is the ability to really ramp up quickly to big sales on those molecules. If I'm not mistaken, dexmed [dexmedetomidine] peak sales will go into 2019, will get into 2019 pretty quickly. So we need those products. We're counting on Kaguya next year to be a driver in Japan because the profitability, not as much sales growth as much as the profitability. That product has showed that the patient in Japan are highly profitable in terms of our reimbursement. So we are counting on those products without a doubt.","And for me, and this is a message that I give to Brik, to Cristiano, who runs Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Andy Frye, it's all about executing on those new products. They have the message. They know what needs to be done and we're counting on them. Thank you.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. And as my follow-up question, you mentioned that you're a little bit more revitalized on the M&A focus and you gave a great answer earlier to what you were looking for in terms of size. But is there anything in particular that has made you revitalized? Is it the business as we're seeing today? Or is it just opportunity or something else? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","If you think about the transformation, Joanne, I put that in three different phases and some of them are all in parallel. But the M&A was the one and the portfolio revamping and transformation of the portfolio is one that had to come after two things that we had to do. We need to put the house in order in terms of organization structure, finance, balance sheet and culture.","Once we get those things done and we have our own organic programs, now we have a team that is working diligently on finding opportunities for us to tag along. So if we don't have those things in place, we couldn't do the other. I couldn't come up six months into this job and say we're going to buy this company and that company. We didn't have the balance sheet.","Now we do. Not only that; we have the strategy and we have competent leaders for the most part that we're making sure that we can execute on this. So as we make adjustments to our organization, I have to say that the people and the employees of Baxter have done a significant amount of heavy lifting due to so many headwinds that we had with this hurricane, anticipated and unanticipated, because some of this stuff caught us by surprise. Not because we didn't prepare, but because the long-lasting effect. But the people of Baxter have worked relentlessly and get this done. Now it's time for us to really get the M&A going as these things are starting to get behind us.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. And happy Halloween.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Happy Halloween as well.","Brik V.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations, at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Norbert Riedel, Chief Science and Innovation Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you for calling in. We're pleased today to announce financial results for the second quarter and also provide you with an update on Baxter's full year 2012 outlook.","As you saw in the press release, which was issued earlier this morning, second quarter sales, after adjusting for FX, increased 4%, and EPS of $1.12 per diluted share was in line with the guidance that we previously provided and reflected an increase of 5% versus the prior year on an adjusted basis. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we continue to have flexibility to make investments in our core product portfolio of critical therapies, expand further in developing in emerging markets, advance the pipeline and pursue opportunities that will position us well for the future and create long-term value for our shareholders.","Baxter continues to broaden its portfolio through investments in research and development and with business development initiatives aimed at enhancing longer term growth. Some recent achievements include the following: First, we gained FDA approval to market GAMMAGARD LIQUID as a treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy or MMN. This is the first and only immunoglobulin treatment approved for MMN in the United States, where Baxter has been granted orphan drug status and complements the approval received for this indication in Europe last year. MMN represents Baxter's first neurological indication and further differentiates the GAMMAGARD LIQUID brand in the chronic care segment of the global immunoglobulin market. MMN is associated with a progressive limb weakness mostly affecting the upper limbs, which can lead to significant difficulty performing simple manual tasks. We estimate that there are approximately 6,000 to 7,000 people worldwide with MMN. And today, immunoglobulin therapy is the first-line treatment for this debilitating disease.","As you know, Baxter is also evaluating GAMMAGARD LIQUID for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Earlier this week, as I'm sure you know, data from abstracts related to the ongoing clinical programs were presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, the AAIC meeting held in Vancouver, Canada. Dr. Norman Relkin of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital\/Weill Cornell Medical Center and the principal investigator in the Alzheimer's trials presented 3-year follow-up data on the Phase II 24-patient study for the first time. As you may recall, the 18-month Phase II clinical results announced in April of 2010 represented the first study in Alzheimer's disease where all 3 measures, cognitive, functional and neuroimaging, reported positive data that were statistically significant. The Phase II study continued to treat 16 patients, open label, with GAMMAGARD LIQUID for a 36-month period. Specifically, 4 subjects who were treated with the optimal dose throughout the study period showed no change from their pretreatment baseline after 36 months on measures of cognition, clinician's global impression of change and activities of daily living, behavior and quality of life scales. While these trials' results are encouraging, the open label extension study included a very small number of participants. The larger Phase III studies, which are currently in progress, will further assess the safety and efficacy of GAMMAGARD LIQUID in the treatment of the disease, and we expect results from the first Phase III study in the first half of 2013.","Within our leading hemophilia franchise, Baxter continues to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to scientific innovation and advancing treatment options for patients living with this hereditary condition. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, more than 400,000 people in the world have hemophilia and 2\/3 are currently undiagnosed or untreated. As the global leader, we remain focused on increasing access and advancing standards of care in improving treatment regimens. Baxter's leading product, ADVATE, continues to be the gold standard treatment in the marketplace given its strong safety, efficacy and convenience profile, which remains a key competitive advantage. We're encouraged by the acceptance of our new prophylaxis label, as evidenced by the strong first half sales performance in the United States. The new label includes an impressive reduction in annual bleed rates, from 44 bleeds when treated on demand to 1 when treated prophylactically, and also offers a new dosing schedule that provides patients the choice of fewer infusions versus standard prophylaxis. In addition, the approval earlier this week of the 4,000 IU dosage strength of ADVATE provides added convenience of single vial dosing for many adult patients, particularly those on a dosing schedule of every 3 days. Also during the quarter, we received approval for ADVATE in China. And we continue to work closely with the Chinese hemophilia community, including both patients and treaters, to provide access to care for this life-saving, life-sustaining therapy. It's estimated that there are 50,000 to 100,000 people in China living with hemophilia A with only a fraction of patients being actively treated.","Also in the area of hemophilia, we recently announced an exclusive global agreement with Chatham Therapeutics, LLC for the development and commercialization of potential treatment for hemophilia B, utilizing Chatham's advanced recombinant gene therapy technology, which has shown potential therapeutic benefit in early clinical studies. A small independent study involving 6 patients using vector components of the Chatham technology was the topic of a 2011 article in The New England Journal of Medicine. This collaboration will involve the next generation of this gene therapy technology which Baxter and Chatham will investigate through U.S.-based clinical trials. This partnership complements Baxter's internal development of a recombinant Factor IX therapy, where we remain on track to file for U.S. regulatory approval before the end of this year. As you may know, hemophilia B is the second most common type of hemophilia and is the result of insufficient amounts of Factor IX, a naturally occurring protein in blood that controls bleeding. Hemophilia B occurs in about 1 in 25,000 males, with approximately 4,000 people in the United States currently diagnosed with the disease.","Within the Medical Products business, we successfully completed the COLLEAGUE replacement program and continue to focus on building upon Baxter's longstanding leadership in IV medication and fluid delivery. Toward this end, we finalized the purchasing -- the purchase of the remaining interest in Sigma International during the second quarter. SIGMA Spectrum large volume pump provides advanced safety and clinician-friendly features and is a system that addresses both the clinical and economic needs of customers. The pump is small and easy to use, features technology intended to help reduce infusion-related adverse drug events, offers wireless connectivity to simplify the transfer of data for updating drug libraries and uses Baxter's standard intravenous administration sets.

Under the terms of this initial 10-year contract manufacturing agreement, Sanquin will provide Baxter with plasma fractionation capacity beginning in 2014, and ramping up to approximately 1.6 million liters annually by the end of 2016. This agreement, along with our plans to build a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Georgia, positions us well to support future growth of plasma-based treatments.","In summary, these highlights depict just a handful of recent achievements that present great opportunities for Baxter in the years to come, and we look forward to updating you on further milestones as the year unfolds.","Now before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to provide a brief update on HyQ. As you may recall, in April, Baxter and Halozyme announced that the FDA requested additional information to complete its regulatory review of HyQ. Baxter and Halozyme have been working to address the agency's concerns related to HyQ and the long-term chronic use of hyaluronidase. As anticipated and as part of the ongoing regulatory review process, we do expect to receive a complete response letter from the FDA within the next few weeks, and we will provide an update at that time. As always, I'd be happy to address any questions on this or other topics during the Q&A. But with that, I'd like to ask Bob to review the second quarter financial results and guidance for 2012. And then when Bob concludes his commentary, I have a few additional comments before, then opening the call to Q&A. So Bob, if you would?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the second quarter, excluding special items, increased 5% to $1.12 per diluted share, which was at the high end of the EPS guidance range we had previously provided of $1.10 to $1.12 per diluted share.","As mentioned in the press release, our GAAP results included a net after-tax benefit from special items, totaling $42 million of income or $0.07 per diluted share for costs and adjustments related to recent business development transactions and certain financial reserves. Specifically, we recorded a special after-tax charge totaling $23 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to a global collaboration with Chatham Therapeutics for the development and commercialization of potential treatments for hemophilia B. This charge was more than offset by a net after-tax benefit of $65 million or $0.11 per diluted share, resulting primarily from adjustments to both the company's COLLEAGUE infusion pump reserves and estimated milestone payments associated with the 2010 acquisition of ApaTech Limited.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the quarter before turning to our financial outlook for 2012.","Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled $3.6 billion in the second quarter and increased 1%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4%, which was in line with our sales growth guidance. As a reminder, the benefit from recent acquisitions, which includes Synovis and Baxa, was partially offset by the divestiture of the U.S. multisource generic injectables business. The net sales benefit of acquisitions and divestitures in the quarter was approximately $50 million and benefited sales growth by approximately 130 basis points.","In terms of the individual businesses, starting with BioScience, global BioScience sales of $1.6 billion increased 1% in the second quarter. And on a constant currency basis, sales increased 4% despite a tough comparison to the prior year when sales increased 10%.","Within the product categories, recombinant sales declined 1% and totaled $565 million. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3% as double-digit growth of 10% in the U.S. was partially offset by the impact of the Australian tender. Excluding impact of the tender, recombinant sales increased 6%. As Bob mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the strength of our U.S. business, where we continue to realize benefits associated with the new expanded label of ADVATE. While there may be some stocking in the U.S. channel during the first half of the year, we are pleased to see strong underlying demand for ADVATE, which is growing in high single digits.","Moving on to plasma proteins. Sales in the quarter were $364 million and were flat to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4% driven primarily by growth of ARALAST for the treatment of hereditary emphysema, and FEIBA, a therapy used in treatment of inhibitors.","In antibody therapy, sales of $376 million declined 1%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 1%, slightly ahead of our expectations. Sales in the U.S. advanced 3% as we continue to be supply constrained and experienced strong demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID, particularly given the successful launch of our SubQ therapy. This growth is partially offset by lower sales outside the U.S. as we continue to optimize our global supply in light of the L.A. facility shutdown planned for the third quarter. I'd also mention that a contribution from Octapharma last year of more than $30 million in sales presented a difficult growth comparison. Excluding the benefit in the prior year, growth in antibody therapies was in double digits.","In the second quarter, sales in regenerative medicine advanced 18% to $174 million. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 21% as a result of double-digit growth of FLOSEAL and the incremental benefit from Synovis of just over $20 million.","Finally, revenues in the other category totaled $87 million in the quarter and declined 5%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, driven by sales of our FSME vaccine and ongoing revenues related to our influenza collaboration in Japan with Takeda.","In Medical Products, global sales in the second quarter exceeded $2 billion, reflecting an increase of 1%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4%. And the net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of $25 million favorably impacted sales growth by 120 basis points.","Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $635 million and were comparable to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4% as global PD growth accelerated to 6%, supported by solid patient gains around the globe. This momentum was offset by lower HD revenues.","Sales in the Global Injectables category of $539 million increased 7%, and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 9%. Excluding the net impact of $10 million related to acquisitions and divestitures, organic growth was 11% on a constant currency basis. Performance was driven primarily by our pharma partnering and compounding businesses and significant growth of certain injectable therapeutics, like cyclophosphamide, a generic oncology drug.","IV therapy sales advanced 6% to $479 million. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 10%, driven by higher demand for IV therapies in the U.S. and strong performance globally of our nutrition franchise, which includes a $35 million benefit related to the Baxa acquisition.","Infusion system sales totaled $209 million, similar to the first quarter, and declined 10%. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 9% as a result of lower access set sales.","Finally, our anesthesia franchise posted sales of $132 million, reflecting an 8% decline versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 6% as a result of a difficult comparison to the prior year and lower U.S. sales due to wholesaler inventory adjustments.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin for the company accelerated to 51.8%, in line with our expectations and reflecting an improvement from the first quarter of 100 basis points. However, this gross margin rate was modestly lower than last year as mix benefits were more than offset by a number of headwinds we've previously discussed and the impact of foreign currency, which had a negative impact of 50 basis points.","SG&A totaled $789 million and increased 3% as a result of recent acquisitions, incremental pension expense and promotional and marketing initiatives within BioScience and in international markets to enhance our global presence. These investments were partially offset by a benefit from foreign currency, business optimization savings and aggressive management of discretionary spending.","R&D spending advanced 15% to $276 million as we continue to fund a number of projects, including investments in our leading hemophilia franchise, Alzheimer's program and our Phase III adult stem cell trial, and it also reflects continued focus on a variety of early-stage initiatives that augment our late-stage pipeline. In addition, I'd highlight that R&D investments this quarter included approximately $20 million of accelerated and discrete items including various milestone payments and expedited supplies of products for use in a number of ongoing clinical trials. I'd also point out that the second quarter represents the highest level of R&D spending on a quarterly basis that we expect for 2012.","The operating margin in the quarter was 21.9%, 160 basis points below prior year, driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency and the significant ramp-up in R&D.","Interest expense was $22 million compared to $15 million last year. This increase is due to incremental expense associated with the $500 million debt issuance in December of last year and lower interest income.","Other income totaled $24 million in the quarter and compared to expense of $13 million last year. This benefit is a result of favorable foreign exchange impact on balance sheet positions, which totaled approximately $10 million, and a benefit of $15 million related to minority interest.","The tax rate was 21.2% for the quarter and, on a year-to-date basis, is in line with our guidance.","And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted EPS was $1.12 per diluted share, an increase of 5%.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $943 million and increased nearly 50% versus last year. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, which is $350 million higher than prior year as a result of lower pension contributions and the collection of aged receivables in Spain during the quarter, which totaled approximately $200 million.","Capital expenditures of $264 million compares to spending of $210 million in the second quarter 2011.","DSO ended the quarter at 52 days, a reduction of more than 5 days versus the prior year, driven primarily by the recent collection in Spain. Inventory turns of 2.4 are somewhat lower than last year and comparable to the first quarter.","Lastly, on a year-to-date basis, we've repurchased 17 million shares for $960 million or, on a net basis, 13 million shares for $788 million, on track to achieve our full year objective of net share repurchases totaling $1 billion.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2012.","First, for the full year, we now expect earnings of $4.50 to $4.56 per diluted share. By line item of the P&L, starting with sales, we continue to project full year sales growth on a constant currency basis of 4% to 5%. Given our outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to have a negative impact on the top line of approximately 3 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported sales growth, which includes the impact of foreign currency, to be approximately 2%. We now expect the full year gross margin rate for the company to expand modestly versus last year's rate of 51.4%. We expect SG&A to grow in low to mid single digits, and we now expect R&D to grow in mid to high single digits, reflecting the strong first half growth and modest growth in the second half. We continue to expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million, and we now expect other, including noncontrolling interest, to be an income item totaling approximately $10 million. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 21.5%, flat with 2011, and expect a full year average share count of approximately 555 million shares, which assumes $1 billion in net share repurchases. From a cash flow perspective, we plan to generate cash flow from operations of more than $3 billion, which includes an outflow of approximately $250 million related to the finalization of a COLLEAGUE consent order.","Now to expand on the full year sales assumptions for each of the businesses, which remain unchanged from previous quarters. First, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect Medical Products sales to grow in mid single digits. This includes IV therapy sales growth of approximately 10%, including an incremental benefit of approximately $120 million related to the Baxa acquisition; anesthesia sales growth in high single digits; Global Injectables sales growth in mid single digits, which includes the net benefit of $20 million related to acquisitions and divestitures; infusion systems is expected to decline approximately 5%; and lastly, renal sales are expected to grow in low single digits.","For BioScience, we project sales growth on a constant currency basis in mid single digits. Our outlook includes recombinant sales growth in low single digits, reflecting the impact of recent tenders; plasma protein sales growth in mid single digits; antibody therapy sales growth in low single digits; regenerative medicine sales growth of approximately 20%, which includes incremental sales from Synovis of approximately $75 million. And finally, we expect the other category to grow approximately 5%, which includes anticipated milestone payments in the second half of the year related to our U.S. influenza vaccine program.","As mentioned in our press release, for the third quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.12 to $1.14 and sales growth on a constant currency basis of 5% to 6%. Based on our outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to impact sales by approximately 5 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 1%.","Thanks. And I will turn the call back over to Bob for his closing remarks.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Bob. Before we open up the call to Q&A, just a few closing comments. First of all, I would tell you I'm very pleased with our results during the first half of the year, which included sales and earnings that were in line with the guidance that we've provided on a quarterly basis. We also, in the first half, continue to build momentum with our internal R&D and new product pipeline, as well as external business development activities. While the global macro environment is going to continue to pose obstacles and health care companies are facing unprecedented complexities given the medically necessary nature of our products, our diversified health care model and strong market positions, we're confident in our ability to drive improved performance over the long term.","As you all know, we have an investor conference that's scheduled for October 9 here in Chicago. And at that time, we'll provide more insight into a number of R&D programs across our businesses, and we'll also provide a longer term outlook on the financial performance of the company, with particular focus on our major franchises, the growth drivers and strategic business opportunities that are critical to our future success. I'm also looking forward to the opportunity to share with all of you why I'm so positive about the future of our company.","So with that, thank you, and let's open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International's website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Bob Hombach, I was hoping you could go into a little more detail about the guidance for the balance of the year. If I look at the $1.12 to $1.14 earnings that you're providing for the third quarter but essentially keeping the full year guidance unchanged at the midpoint -- but the sales guidance for the third quarter likely represents the highest growth that we'll see for years. Just talk about the negative leverage that -- and how that flows through the P&L and if there are any discrete items in the third quarter that are negatively impacting the earnings numbers.","Robert J. Hombach","Well, yes. David, I would say first off, I wouldn't say that the third quarter is the highest sales growth. I think you'll see comparable sales growth in the third and fourth quarter in order to get to the full year organic growth guidance that we've projected. I think the single biggest difference between third and fourth quarter, in terms of acceleration at the bottom line, is really just timing of some key tenders in emerging markets, primarily Eastern Europe and Latin America that just from a shipment timing perspective are going to land in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Also, from an FX standpoint, there has been a lot of volatility here lately. And so I think as we look at the third quarter in particular, since that's more near term here, I would say there may be a touch of conservatism in the third quarter number as well.","Mary Kay Ladone","And, David, it's Mary Kay. I'd also add just on growth margin. We do expect margin in the third quarter to be lower than Q2 but still show expansion over the prior year, call it roughly 50 basis points. And Q4 will be our highest gross margin quarter, again projecting something in the 50-basis-point improvement year-over-year.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then Bob Parkinson, on HyQ. I think you're probably going to expect a lot of questions, but you sort of opened yourself up in -- on the complete response letter, which you expect to get in a couple of weeks. Could you maybe provide a little more detail on what we should look for in that letter, how the dialogue with the agency has gone since the April announcement, whether you still think you need a panel, et cetera, where from here?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. Let me maybe respond to that, David, and then I might ask Dr. Riedel to comment as well. We've had a lot of back and forth with the agency since our last call last quarter on this. As I commented in my prepared comments, we do expect to receive a complete response letter from the FDA within the next few weeks. And I think, at that time, some of the specific expectations will be clarified. And of course, when we get that letter, we will communicate externally and in a more specific way than I think what we've been able to, to date. So beyond that, I think I'd prefer to wait until we actually get the letter and then can share with everyone, as I said, in a more specific way than what we've been able to do thus far in that regard. And I don't think we want -- at this point, there's really not a lot we can add to that. Norbert?","Norbert G. Riedel","No, I don't have anything.","Robert L. Parkinson","All right.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just lastly, any update on outstanding tenders, such as Canada, for comments or anything else that might have come up there during the quarter?","Robert J. Hombach","No, not at this point. Nothing official has been finalized at this point, David.","Operator","Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan is on the line with a question.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, on HyQ. Bob, can you give us any more insights into your view on what you think the CRL means for timing?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, again, as I said, I don't really want to speculate. We'll get the complete response letter shortly. It will be within the next few weeks. It might even be somewhat sooner than that. So let's wait until we get that. And as I've said, we'll be very forthcoming in terms of what the content of that letter is. As I said, in response to David's earlier question, we've had a lot of dialogue back and forth with the agency, but I think the letter will really -- for the first time, really specifically clarify what the expectations are with the agency. So at this stage, I'd prefer to just leave it at that.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Do you have an update on Europe, on where you're filing is in Europe and the response there?","Robert L. Parkinson","It's moving along. Norbert or Bob, I don't know if you want to comment on that?","Norbert G. Riedel","Yes. So as you know, we might be submitted our file in Europe and the regulatory review process there is ongoing. And I do not expect to hear much from Europe until the end of the year or the fourth quarter of the year. It's still ongoing, the review process.","Mary Kay Ladone","And Mike, it's Mary Kay. I think it's fair to say that we're not clear if there's any implications of the FDA concerns on the European approval.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can we spend just a minute on the Sanquin collaboration because I think that's an important event in terms of incremental opportunity in your Plasma Protein business? So can you just talk a little bit about logistics in terms of how that would work from you shipping product to their fractionating? And then how should we think about the economics of that incremental lot?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. I would say, we're very excited about this. And I'm going to ask Bob to just kind of walk through the specific elements of this because I think it's important for everybody to understands the various components. So Bob, why don't you?","Robert J. Hombach","Great. Yes. So I would characterize this very much as a total manufacturing type arrangement here. We are providing the raw plasma we're collecting it ourself, providing it to Sanquin. They will do fractionation and then send the pays to us for IGs and albumin. They will do purifications. They will finish for PD Factor VIII. And so really, we'll have control over the vast majority of the overall supply chain here, with the exception of the fractionation for the pays, particularly for IGs. We do have a fixed fee arrangement here. So from an economic standpoint -- and as you know, if you look at the overall cost picture, the marginal cost associated with the fractionation piece versus collections and other aspects of the overall cost picture is a modest slice of the overall picture. And the rate at which we're being charged here is very consistent with our own cost to do similar activities within Baxter. So really, this is an outstanding deal from an economic standpoint because it really doesn't change our cost position net-net and allows us access to a significant opportunity here for increased capacity over time.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just one follow-up on that. So can you just talk about your ability to increase raw material supplies and access to plasma?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, certainly. I mean, we have a large footprint in the U.S. today. We have some capacity within our existing footprint to increase collections. Over time, as we continue to do -- as we have done in the past, as we grow this business, we need continue to add incremental collection capacity in order to support that. Certainly, for the Georgia facility, we had it within our plants to continue to add additional collection capacity. And with this opportunity here, we will be -- in addition to executing this agreement with Sanquin, we will be growing collection capacity, roughly commensurate with this in terms of how much incremental this adds to our overall picture. But we don't view that as being a rate limiter here at all. Collections will not be a bottleneck as far as we're concerned.","Operator","David Lewis from Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bob, I wonder if we can come back to Sanquin for a second just sort of strategically. I guess the announcement of -- is a positive, obviously solves for maybe a near term capacity problem. But if you think about your access to capacity between L.A. frac and then obviously transitioning to the Georgia facility, this sort of implies that you're trying to fill sort of intermediate production capacity. So I guess with the benefit of hindsight, what do you think is sort of the strategic driver? Do you feel like the market demand has just picked up greater than you would have thought several years ago? Is it that where you thought the greenfield facility would come on faster? Is it kind of where you see L.A. frac in terms of its maturities? Help us understand sort of the timing and what you think brought about this decision as you think about the past couple of years.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. This is Bob Parkinson, David. Let me take that and then Mary Kay or Bob can add to my comment. I think you characterized the Sanquin deal the right way. This is an intermediate gap filler. And I think there's 3 dimensions of our capacity expansion. Clearly, long term is the announcement that we made last quarter with the greenfield site in Georgia, this announcement this morning with Sanquin which can add very meaningful incremental frac capacity starting in 2014, as we mentioned. And then of course, short term, our decision to put old L.A. back in production, recognizing that we're going to continue to manage through for a while the constraints that, that creates until we can get old L.A. back into production. We also have other short-term levers we can pull in terms of scaling up more volume at new L.A., some expansion opportunities, as you know, at our Rieti facility and to some degree, our Vienna facility. So it's really a short-term levers that we can pull that I just described. Sanquin is an intermediate gap filler and so on. So back then to your question, what's driving this? We have consistently maintained that the Plasma Protein business is a very attractive business that should present robust growth for the foreseeable future, okay? We're actually seeing now market growth candidly, globally that's in excess of kind of the 6% to 8% that we have projected over the last few years. Now whether the recent strength we've seen in the global market will be sustained out in the future -- multiple years is to be determined, but there's no doubt the global market right now is growing faster than that. Our decision both in greenfield, as well as the Sanquin deal we announced this morning, is not only to support what's going to continue to be, I think, robust market growth, but our competitive position has been enhanced as well. Our 10% SubQ has been very well received in the U.S. As you know, we got the approval recently, as I commented this morning on the MMN indication, which allows us to promote in the neurology channel. We continue to manage through, obviously, the HyQ situation. We see increasing demand in emerging developing markets. We project consistent robust demand out of China for albumin. And this is all before you get to, again, the \"wild card\" associated with Alzheimer's. So I think all of you can interpret this announcement this morning as an expression of our confidence in the continued growth of the Plasma Protein business. And this is -- it's a good -- it's a very good business to be in. And we think our competitive position, due to the recent approvals we've received and so on, has been enhanced from what it has been previously. So that's the sum and substance of it.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful, very clear, Bob. And then maybe just Bob Hombach, one quick one. On ADVATE, second straight quarter in a row, we've seen significant U.S. strength, obviously, we would assume based on the new indication. You sort of suggested that perhaps the second quarter strength was based on some finished good inventory building. Do you sort of have information to believe that really is maybe some distributors stocking? Or is that just sort of a message of conservatism because you only have sort of 2 quarters of performance?","Robert J. Hombach","No. I mean, we think there is a bit of stocking here, but we have seen an uptick in underlying demand over the last 2 quarters for ADVATE in the U.S., above what we would consider to be the normal market growth rate of mid single digits. There's no question about it. So the vast majority of the growth we're reporting, we believe, is growth both in terms of utilization within our own patient base because the adult prophylaxis label allows us to reiterate for our adult patients the benefits of staying on a consistent regimen of prophylaxis, which most pediatric patients do a very good job of, but that tends to wane a bit, but also conversions to ADVATE related to, again, both the prophylaxis label, as well as the potential for less frequent dosing with our PK dosing approach of every third day administration. So we definitely have seen an uptick in underlying demand for ADVATE in the U.S.","Mary Kay Ladone","And, David, I would just add. I think you -- we estimate that impact on stocking in, call it, the 2 to 3 points of growth in both the first and second quarters, which is probably in the realm of about $15 million of sales. And I would mention that our forecast for the back half of the year, we believe that those inventory levels may come down. So we're not projecting 10% growth in the back half of the year in the U.S. It's going to be probably more like low to mid single digits.","Operator","Rajeev Jashnani with UBS is on line with a question.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I had a question on the plasma deal as well, first. I was wondering if you could talk about on -- just very back of the on globe map [ph]. It seems like a lot of the capacity from this deal -- or I should say the capacity, the product that's coming from Sanquin would drive a lot of the incremental IVIG revenues between '13 and '16. I was just wondering if you could comment on that first.","Robert J. Hombach","No. Well, I definitely want to be clear about this point and we wanted to make sure we included it in the press release. This Sanquin opportunity, once the capacity is in place and qualified to run our product through and so on, we won't see a sellable product out of Sanquin until 2014. And as happens in all plasma facility expansions that we've been involved in, there will be a ramp-up phase. And so we won't see the full 1.6 million liter of run rate until the end of 2016. So this will contribute to the picture but will not be the primary driver in that time frame. Again, we have opportunity to ramp up new L.A. Bob mentioned that the expansion of Rieti as well that will be coming online and the fact that we're extending the useful life of the old L.A. facility. All of those are contributory to the picture here, and this is just another piece of the puzzle. It's not the primary driver.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up, just on HyQ. I guess, maybe -- is it reasonable to expect another human trial for -- or prior to approval for HyQ? Or maybe you could just help explain what other mechanisms there would be to satisfy the FDA requirement?","Robert L. Parkinson","Rajeev, Bob Parkinson here. Again, I know this is not going to be particularly satisfying to you, but again, I don't want to speculate on the need for another trial. Let's wait until we get the complete response letter, then we'll have really -- for the first time, despite a number of ongoing conversations and dialogues we've had with the FDA, as I mentioned, this would really be the first time that their expectations will be clearly delineated. So it's not that far off. I would suggest everybody, just be patient. When we get that, again, we'll communicate on a very timely basis the content of that complete response letter. So again, I don't want to avoid your question, but it involves some speculation. And at this stage, I really don't want to do that.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. That's understandable. If I could squeeze in one more just on the recombinant factor.","Robert L. Parkinson","Sure, go ahead.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe you could talk about your marketing efforts regarding the prophylaxis label. How intense are those? Do you anticipate becoming more aggressive in that regard in the future?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, they're -- I would say they're intensifying the approval, actually this week, of the 4,000 IU dosage strength. While that, on the surface, may not appear to be a big deal to you, is actually very helpful because for adults, given that dosage strength, it really does help facilitate the prophylaxis administration and also the PK dosing that could lead to a reduced number of administrations to once every 3 days, which really advances the therapy in terms of dosing frequency and so on. So I think with that approval, Rajeev, you'll see our marketing efforts now intensify fairly significantly. As we've commented, we're pleased with the traction we've received to date. We would expect that, that momentum is going to continue.","Robert J. Hombach","I would just add that our market research would indicate the #1 concern for hemophilia A patients is controlling bleeds. And so we've been very focused ever since we got the approval in December of last year on the significant reduction in bleeds from 44 to 1 offered by our base prophylaxis for adults. And so that program started in earnest immediately. And as Bob mentioned, with the 4,000 IU approval here, we will launch even with more vigor the PK dosing approach here, which will add additional convenience to patients. But that reduction in bleed has been a key focus. And I think you'll see that playing out in some of the demand improvement here in the first 2 quarters.","Operator","Bob Hopkins of Bank of America is on line with a question.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just another one on Sanquin and the announcement there. Obviously, you guys, of late, have been talking about a lot of puts and takes in terms of capacity, and I'm just wondering if with this announcement, you wouldn't be willing to spell out a little more specifically. What is your capacity in liters as you look at 2013, '14, '15, '16? Is there any way you can kind of give you some specific numbers in terms of liter capacity?","Robert L. Parkinson","Not this morning, but I would suggest that this is something we can get into in more detail in the October investor conference. We actually plan on including that as part of the presentation. We realize why you're curious about that, but let's defer that until we get together in October.","Robert J. Hombach","And, Bob, I would just say, there are a lot of moving pieces, but I think the announcement today just increases our confidence that we're going to be able to meet market demand on a unit basis at least in the 6% to 8% range, beyond 2013 as we bring old L.A. back online and have this come online in 2014.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So that was going to be my next question. Is that the way we should think about it, that this deal allows you to stay in that 6% to 8% range? Or does it get you above that?","Robert J. Hombach","At this point, it's at least in that range. And we'll give you an update in October.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. On the R&D line, this particular quarter, can you give us just a little better sense of the milestone payments there? What was that related to?","Robert L. Parkinson","Go ahead, Bob.","Robert J. Hombach","I'm sorry, what...","Mary Kay Ladone","It's milestones.","Robert L. Parkinson","R&D milestones.","Robert J. Hombach","Oh, [indiscernible] yes, it's a combination of clinical materials. The way the process works for some of our key programs is as clinical batches are completed for certain clinical trials and they're released into the trial, we have to expense the costs associated with those products. And so from a timing perspective, we've been looking to accelerate a few of our key programs. And so a few of those releases occurred in the quarter a bit sooner than we expected, which drove the expense up. The milestone payments were fairly small discrete items in a couple of different areas. So I would say the biggest single chunk there was really this release of clinical material and a couple of key trials for it that happened a bit sooner than we expected, which is why the R&D growth rate will moderate in the back half of the year just because of that timing.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just one longer term, bigger picture question on ADVATE. That's another area where there's a bunch of puts and takes in the future in terms of competitive launches versus your longer-acting formulation coming in a couple of years. I just want to get a sense, generally, is that a line item on your revenue statement that you think can continue to grow even if the competition is able to continue to put up good data and launch their product on time, which I realize are assumptions? But there's a lot going on with ADVATE, and I'm just curious how confident you are that as we work our way forward over the next couple of years that you think that can continue to grow despite oncoming competition.","Robert L. Parkinson","Bob Parkinson here. The answer is yes, that line will continue to grow. Again, in October, we'll get together. We'll be more specific in that regard. I think short term -- the World Federation of Hemophilia meeting was last week, and I think one of the takeaways from that is that clinicians and patients are reluctant to switch away from currently effective stable factor rate therapy given sensitivities, the higher risk of inhibitor formation in the B-domain deleted products. And particularly given our enhanced twice a week or once every 3 day convenience that's offered by the ADVATE PK dosing approach, we think that we can mitigate in the short term any competitive threats in terms of longer acting. As I commented in my prepared comments, longer term, this is a global market that's only modestly penetrated. It is a franchise in which we are the leader. We're committed to remain the leader, as evidenced by our expanding new product flow, whether that's Factor IX, recombinant von Willebrand Factor VII, our own longer acting initiative. So we're very excited about the long-term prospects of, as you call it, this line on our revenue. And so that, definitely, will continue to grow and we'll share that with you when we're together in October. Norbert could you...","Norbert G. Riedel","Yes. I'd like to follow up on that for a moment and reiterate what Bob Hombach has mentioned. Mainly, that's the #1 priority for patients is reducing or stopping bleeds. And ADVATE, in particular, with the new label, have shown that very effectively. The second key concern of patients is safety and primarily safety around the formation of inhibitor. And when you look at ADVATE, we have, in the field, in the use of ADVATE, an inhibitor rate of 0.3%, meaning about 3 inhibitors in 1,000 previously treated patients, which is a remarkably, remarkably strong safety record. And then on the third item of priority for patients is convenience, in which the 3-day prophylactic PK dosing and 855 coming in, the longer-acting Factor VIII going into Phase III by the end of this year. I think we have a best-in-class molecule in all 3 categories, where patients actually look for the ideal features of the therapy. And I believe that ADVATE is extremely well positioned to address those needs, including, for example, not just the 4,000 unit dosage, but the fact that we have 11 different dosage strengths for ADVATE to accommodate very small patients, larger patients. You have to have a portfolio of offerings in the hemophilia A space to really be able to address the variable needs of patients that are active, less active, very young, older. And so I do believe you need to have the kind of portfolio we have to address that adequately. And therefore, we feel very confident that we are extremely well positioned for the years to come.","Operator","Larry Keusch of Raymond James is on line with a question.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bob, I wanted to just come back to the demand for the plasma proteins that you guys are talking about with the Sanquin deal. I mean, if you go back and look at the comments that you guys had from the past several quarterly conference calls, you indicated that you felt like you had enough capacity to supply a market that was growing 6% to 8%. And clearly, now you're making some comments that you believe demand is now increasing. So I'd be curious just to get some thoughts on why is that demand beginning to increase. Is it off label usage? Is it, obviously, emerging markets are going to start to become an opportunity? But any thoughts why demand is increasing will be really helpful.","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, I think first of all, as we commented a number of times, Larry, we, and I think others in the industry, are more actively promoting, let's say, in the primary immunodeficiency area, I'd say promoting really, educating the treaters in terms of it being significantly underdiagnosed even in developed markets. So you've got a demand creation dimension that exists today that historically in this business didn't exist. So I think that's one factor. The other factor, which you mentioned, is clearly true, which is emerging and developing markets are adopting these therapies. These are, again, what I'd describe as medically necessary therapies. So their high priority is emerging, developing markets dedicate more spending to health care. These are the kinds of areas that they're going to spend in. In terms of off label use, I can't really comment on that. I'm not sure how much of that, if anything, is driving the demand, but it is -- the market right now is remarkably robust. And just to comment on the Sanquin thing. Let's look at the Sanquin thing as affording the opportunity of what I'll call surge capacity over and above our existing network, alright, as opposed to capacity that is necessary to, say, get to a 6% kind of a market growth. I think that's an important perspective that everyone needs to understand. And Bob, I don't know if you want to add to that.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. One other subtlety that I think also contributes to some of the growth we may be seeing even currently in the market that's beyond the 6% to 8%, the fastest-growing segment of the SubQ market is -- excuse me, of PID is the SubQ market. And as you know, given that -- the more frequent dosing in that therapy and how it's absorbed into the body as it's currently offered in the marketplace, patients need to use more grams in order to get the same level of efficacy, going SubQ versus IV. And so that can be anywhere -- in our case for our 10% SubQ, about 37% of a normal dose and with some competitors, 50% of a normal dose. So as more of the markets go that direction, more grams are going to be consumed per patient. And that could also be contributing that to some of the stronger growth we're seeing in here and now. And we think that trend will continue as convenience of dosing at home for PID patients is certainly a key driver in the marketplace.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just a couple other quick ones. Are there any minimums, by the way, associated with that Sanquin contract? Or is it truly surge capacities as you've got...","Robert J. Hombach","No. There are no minimums here in terms of a take-or-pay situation.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 last ones for you guys. Obviously, you do have a capacity limitation on IVIG right now as you modulate the global distribution. And I'm just wondering if you now have a bit more ability to focus more on the chronic care markets and away from some of the more price-sensitive customers because, again, you do have some limited availability there. So perhaps, that creates a little more stability in the business as a whole. And then the second quick one was just on home hemo. Is there any update there? And is it still CE Mark for 2013 is how we should be looking for it?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. So in terms of the dynamics in the marketplace, yes, we've been following that path. You just described a focusing scarce resources on those parts of the market, where we see the best opportunity. And so that has manifested itself in several ways, including product prioritization in terms of the U.S. market, and again focusing our marketing efforts around the primary immunodeficiency on-label indication we have, and that being one of the fastest-growing segments in the market, particularly our 10% SubQ. So that absolutely is the strategy that we're following. And so maybe on home hemo...","Robert L. Parkinson","Mary Kay, why don't you comment on home hemo, if you would?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes. I would just say, Larry, that there is no change. Everything remains on track. We continue with our trial here in the U.S. Remember that was a small trial with 20, 24 patients over about a 10-week period. So we're on track to complete that trial here in the second half of the year. We're also on track to start our Canadian trial before the end of the year. And as you know, both of those trials will support the CE marking of the home hemo device in Europe in 2013. We're still working through whether we need 1 or 2 trials in the U.S. for the filing that we expect to do in 2014 here in the U.S.","Operator","Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray is on line with a question.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So I wanted to follow up on ADVATE just one more time here. And we cover a lot of launches. We're familiar with the shape of small molecule launches. And as we've seen, as you've talked about, chronic treatment of hemophilia is quite different historically as folks -- you pointed out they are reluctant to switch off of stable therapy and regular habits of treatment. Can you talk a little bit about -- and the other thing, I guess, that's different about this one, Norbert as you pointed out, is the dosing sizes, these vials that facilitate the administration of ADVATE at the different dosing levels in adults or young adult prophylaxis. So if you could talk maybe about what other important moving parts are there to sort of complete your program for promoting and marketing around PK dosing. And if you could give us a sense of maybe where you think you are now, maybe some baseline metrics on where you think prophylaxis is now. And then how much of this, how much of your business, how much of your patients do you think could move to this twice a week or once every third day dosing over time? That would be very helpful. Then I have one follow-up.","Norbert G. Riedel","So maybe I'll start with some of the science around Factor VIII. There is no small molecule therapy that treats hemophilia A. All hemophilia A treatments are recombinant Factor VIII or plasma-derived Factor VIII. The really important distinction is that our ADVATE molecule is a full-length Factor VIII, which is, if you will, the authentic molecule that would also be the naturally appearing molecule in someone who does not need a Factor VIII administered. The competitive landscape is one where all other protein -- Factor VIII protein is a B-domain deleted or otherwise manipulated in a way that they are not full-length or have other protein components attached to them. And we have very deliberately stayed away from any one of those approaches because our conviction is based on the experience we have made with our full-length ADVATE molecule that, that is indeed the very best therapy from a point of efficacy, safety, as well as convenience. And when I mentioned the various dosages we have, the 11 by now in our portfolio, I keep reminding our audiences that when you have hemophilia A, you are diagnosed with that condition shortly after birth and you will depend on Factor VIII therapy throughout your entire life, all the way through the end of your life. And there is a huge, huge range of needs that someone has, who is a very small pediatric patient, who is an adolescent, who is very typically active, who as an adult, either more or less active. And I have a really, really hard time seeing how a one-trick pony, if you will, can actually do the trick and provide adequate therapy for that kind of like wide spectrum of needs that patients with hemophilia A have. That's why we have focused so strongly on continuously expanding and improving the repertoire of our Factor VIII offerings, including reconstitution devices in prophylactic, surgical, pediatric labels, the way we actually offer now prophylaxis with a pharmacokinetic twist and approach. And so I really do believe that, that sets a gold standard that is very, very difficult to match. And that's why we feel confident that we have the right approach to hemophilia A therapy and have had it for 20 years now. Factor VIII -- recombinant Factor VIII has been a Baxter product since 1992. We have a 20-year track record, and I think it's a terrific track record. So I think that basically describes it.","Robert L. Parkinson","The protein question, Bob or Mary Kay maybe.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I don't know that there's any scientific reason why someone's on every other day prophylaxis, why they couldn't move to every third day. So not really...","Robert L. Parkinson","But Matt's question about penetration on prophy in the market and the opportunity, because he asked what other things do we have? What the reality is -- the big thing is the prophy, the PK dosing, we are at the very early stages of rolling this out. As I commented earlier, we're accelerating now the promotion. We think that's a significant opportunity. But maybe more specifically, to put that in context in answer to your question. So Mary Kay, would you...","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes. As many of you know, prophylactic treatment in the adult population had been very low. I think a combination of both the annual bleed data that's included in our new label that Norbert commented on earlier in combination with fewer infusions offered by a 3-day dosing regimen will help to accelerate that prophylactic adoption of adults. So we're looking forward to participating in that, and that's part of our marketing strategy here in the near term.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up on the plasma market generally. I know that already the hairs on the back  of your neck is going up. The market commentary hasn't been one of your favorite things to talk about but particularly strategy or pricing or consolidation. But I am interested -- this deal with Sanquin and some comments from one of your competitors about potentially the opportunity to sort of have more interchangeability, more flexibility in a way that your collected plasma is sort of utilized across multiple fractionation facilities, multiple sites under an FDA approval. I'm wondering if you see some flexibility in the future? Do you see more deals like this, more flexible use of capacity across a branded manufacturer like yourself and some regional players that might have capacity to put to work? Is this a one-off? Is this something that might happen more often in the future?","Robert L. Parkinson","Go ahead, Bob.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I think we built in a fair amount of flexibility into our existing network. The vast majority of the plasma we collect is in the U.S., and U.S. plasma is really sellable around the world. Our facilities are FDA approved, so that we can sell in the U.S. or other markets. So I think within our network, we certainly have that flexibility today. I think given the growth opportunities we see and the potential for new indications and other expansions of the strictly per IG, we're going to continue to explore ways to enhance our flexibility on the supply side going forward here. So I think we're going to -- the Sanquin deal, we think, is a very, very good deal, but we're going to continue to look for other ways to enhance our flexibility.","Operator","Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank is on line with a question.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have 2 questions. I guess the first just kind of still following on the plasma kind of theme. Can you just maybe give us an update just kind of on the old L.A. frac just in terms of time lines and to the extent that maybe some of that takes longer? Could we also look at the Sanquin as offering flexibility for that as well?","Robert L. Parkinson","Go ahead, Bob.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Kristen, as we talked about, we're looking to take the old L.A. facility down late in the third quarter. It will be down about 5 months. We'll bring it back up online, get it requalified. I would characterize that the refurbishment things we're doing is very modest and that the risk is low, but nothing is risk-free in this world, but we think it's fairly low. It will take several months to get the qualification, the production runs done and have products available to the marketplace. That's why we've talked about mid-2013 of coming out of this constrained environment and being in a much better position. So that's still the time frame we're operating under.","Robert L. Parkinson","Just to reiterate, yes, to Bob's point, our time frame and our plans with old L.A. haven't changed at all. The Sanquin deal is independent of that. So just to be clear, it's to provide surge capacity going forward not because our view or our plans for renovation of old L.A. have changed. The plan is the same as it's been for the last 6 to 9 months there, Kristen.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up. I think it's a question that Bob had asked earlier, where he'd asked if ADVATE was a line that you can continue to grow. I just wanted to make sure that I was understanding your response correctly. Is it your guys' view that ADVATE itself can continue to grow despite longer-acting products? Or is it your view that the recombinant line in total can continue to grow? Because I know you have a number of...","Robert L. Parkinson","It's our view, Kristen. So the answer is yes. It's our view that ADVATE specifically will continue to grow over the long-range plan. Our hemophilia franchise will grow and grow at a faster rate as we expand the new product offering. So that's as clear as I can be.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then you had mentioned, I think, Factor IX. I think you were filing before the end of the year.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you give us an update on recombinant von Willebrand and then Factor VIIa as well?","Robert L. Parkinson","Mary Kay, do you want the latest on that?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, Factor VIIa, as you know, we completed a Phase II. Our expectation, which remains unchanged, is to start a Phase III before the end of the year. On von Willebrand, we're enrolling patients and we expect to complete the Phase III trial and file probably in the mid to second half with -- of next year, 2013.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then still starting the long-acting Phase III before the end of the year as well?","Mary Kay Ladone","Correct. As you know, we're currently in our Phase I, and we'll complete that before the end of the year and move in to Phase III.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Will we see data on that before you start the Phase III? Or should we just assume if you're starting the Phase III, the data from the Phase I looked good?","Mary Kay Ladone","We haven't determined when we'll present the data from the Phase I yet, Kristen.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations of Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, and welcome to our Q4 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Norbert Riedel, Chief Science and Innovation Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thanks for calling in. As I've had the opportunity to reflect on 2011, I can tell you that I'm very pleased with the progress our company continues to make financially, operationally and scientifically. In fact, despite the global macro environment, competitive landscape and ongoing uncertainty, Baxter continues to report strong financial results. This includes record sales and earnings for 2011, as you saw this morning, while accelerating investments in innovation, advancing our new product pipeline and pursuing other initiatives to enhance long-term growth while returning significant value to our shareholders.","As you saw in our press release issued earlier this morning, adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter increased 5% to $1.17 per diluted share. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.31, which exceeded our original guidance range provided last January of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share. On a reported basis, worldwide sales in the fourth quarter increased 3%, and after adjusting for the U.S. multisource generic injectable divestitures, sales growth was 4%.","For the full year 2011, worldwide sales increased 8% or 5% after adjusting for foreign exchange and the divestiture. And we're particularly pleased with our continuing ability to generate significant cash flow, which exceeded $2.8 billion for the year while maintaining our disciplined capital allocation strategy of returning value to our shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases.","As some of you may know, in October, Baxter achieved an important milestone in celebrating our 80th anniversary, providing an opportunity to reflect on our great heritage as a pioneer and innovator in the development of lifesaving, life-sustaining therapies for patients and customers around the world. As you've heard me say many times, innovation is our most important strategic priority, and 2011 was an outstanding year, as we significantly increased our R&D investment to a record level.","This has resulted in a meaningful new product pipeline that's as strong today as at any time in our company's history, one that's focused on enhancing clinical outcomes, improving the safety and cost effective of treatments and expanding access to care. I'm specifically encouraged with our pipeline achievements in 2011, as we advanced more than 20 key R&D programs within late-stage clinical development. Many of these programs have the potential to profoundly improve the treatment and delivery of care for chronic diseases like hemophilia, immune deficiencies, Alzheimer's disease and end-stage renal disease.","So let me take just a moment to highlight a number of these accomplishments. Within our leading hemophilia franchise, we have achieved a number of milestones. For example, we've now completed the global Phase I\/II clinical trial of BAX 817 or recombinant Factor VIIa therapy and plan to advance into Phase III in early 2012. We've also completed enrollment in the Phase I\/III clinical trial of BAX 326,  our recombinant Factor IX treatment for hemophilia B, and expect to conclude this trial and file for U.S. approval in 2012.","We initially announced the initiation of the Phase III trial of BAX 111, the first and only recombinant bundle of brent [ph] factor, which provides an alternative treatment option to currently marketed therapies that are plasma derived. This is an exciting opportunity for Baxter, with global market potential in excess of $300 million.","In December, ADVATE was approved by the FDA as the only Factor VIII prophylactic treatment for both children and adults. The approval was based on a Phase IV prophylaxis study demonstrating that ADVATE significantly reduced median annual bleed rates in hemophilia A patients by 98%, representing a reduction from 44 bleeds when treated on demand to 1 when treated prophylactically.","Of the 2 prophylactic regimens approved for use, the pharmacokinetic-driven dosing schedule of every 3 days offer some patients the choice of fewer infusions versus the current standard prophylaxis regimen. And earlier this month, we announced the dosing of the first patients in a Phase I clinical trial of BAX 855, a longer-acting PEGylated Factor VIII therapy based on the full-length ADVATE molecule. The Phase I results will serve as the foundation for advancing this important program for clinical development in determining whether BAX 855 can offer a treatment regimen requiring fewer infusions than ADVATE.","In the area of immune deficiencies, we continue to be successful in driving differentiation of GAMMAGARD LIQUID by offering various dosage forms, enhancing delivery options and expanding the number of approved indications. As you know, early in 2011, we introduced the first and only 30-gram dose vial for GAMMAGARD LIQUID in the U.S., the most frequently prescribed dose for primary immune-deficiency patients, which enhances user convenience.","We received FDA approval for GAMMAGARD LIQUID 10% subQ, allowing Baxter to participate for the first time in this fast-growing segment of the PID market in the U.S. We're pleased with the initial market acceptance, as we secured both share gains and conversions of Baxter patients to this new therapy, and we expect to continue to capitalize on the differentiation we've achieved with this product's favorable tolerability profile, speed of infusion and low infusion site reaction rate included in our label of 2.7%.","We also submitted HyQ for approval in the U.S., Europe and Canada during 2011. HyQ allows for enhanced delivery of GAMMAGARD LIQUID subcutaneously, facilitated by recombinant human hyaluronidase. The regulatory submissions were based on results from a Phase III trial, which met both its primary and secondary endpoints and were represented at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology in Boston.","We also received approval in Europe for GAMMAGARD LIQUID or KIOVIG as a therapy for multifocal motor neuropathy. This represents the first and only centrally licensed indication for MMN in that region and Baxter's first chronic neurological indication. We also recently completed the Phase III MMN clinical trial and submitted for approval in the U.S. where we've been granted orphan drug status.","We enrolled the last patient in our first Phase III study for Alzheimer's in 2011 and expect to complete that trial by the end of this year. And earlier this week, we announced our plans to initiate a second confirmatory Phase III trial following a successful futility analysis that was conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. It's important to note that the futility analysis is not an interim look, and the trial remains blinded. However, the analysis indicated greater than a 20% statistical probability of success in achieving statistical significance in the primary efficacy outcomes.","In our regenerative medicine business, we achieved a number of milestones, including the approval and U.S. launch of ARTISS Fibrin Sealant for use in facial surgery and the U.S. regulatory filing for TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant for vascular surgery providing a broad hemostasis label. As we've previously mentioned, we're very pleased with the publication of data from Baxter's Phase II chronic myocardial ischemia adult stem cell program, which was published in the scientific journal Circulation Research.","Results from the trial demonstrate that injection of the patient's own CD34+ adult stem cells into targeted sites in the heart had therapeutic benefits such as reduced angina episodes and improved exercise tolerance. We look forward to moving into a Phase III clinical trial early this year.","And finally, we initiated our first home hemodialysis trial, which has the potential to deliver enhanced clinical outcomes and greater patient convenience to those with end-stage renal disease. The first U.S. clinical study will assess device performance and safety in patients undergoing in-center hemodialysis, and multiple trials are planned in the U.S. and Canada to support CE Mark in 2013 and the U.S. launch in 2014.","These achievements depict just a handful of the programs in our pipeline that will present great opportunities for Baxter in the years to come. And I'm increasingly encouraged with our progress, and we look forward to updating you on further R&D achievements in the future.","Throughout 2011, we also accelerated the pace of business development, with several new business partnerships that complement our current businesses, enhance our product portfolio and leverage our scientific, manufacturing and commercial capabilities. Some examples include the acquisition of Prism Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed and received FDA approval for NEXTERONE.","Second, we acquired Baxa Corporation, which complements Baxter's global portfolio of nutritional therapies and drug delivery systems, leverages our global footprint and leadership in the hospital pharmacy and supports patient safety.","Third, we recently announced the definitive agreement to acquire Synovis, an acquisition that complements and expands Baxter's regenerative medicine and biosurgery franchise, including a number of devices and biological products for hemostasis, tissue sealing and adherence. ","And finally, we entered into a collaboration with Momenta to develop and commercialize follow-on biologic products, also known as biosimilars. With this collaboration, Baxter will leverage its leading clinical development and biologic manufacturing expertise, global leadership in injectables and global commercial capabilities, while Momenta will provide its expertise in high-resolution analytics, characterization and product and process development. This collaboration complements our early stage pipeline and allows us to expand our leadership and leverage our expertise and capabilities in biologics at a time when the global regulatory pathway for approval is becoming more evident.","These transactions reflect our attempt of being more proactive on the business development front going forward, and they also exemplify the types of opportunities we will pursue. Those that complement our existing portfolio and expand our market-leading positions, leverage our global footprint, channel our customer relationships, capitalize on our core scientific or manufacturing capabilities and provide for low-integration risk and a higher confidence in achieving success.","As always, I'd be happy to address any questions on these or other topics during the Q&A. And with that, I'd like to ask Bob to review our fourth quarter financial results and guidance for 2012 in more detail, and then I'll come back to provide some closing perspectives. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share on the fourth quarter, excluding special items, increased 5% to $1.17 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.18 per diluted share. As we mentioned in our press release, our GAAP results include after-tax special items of approximately $200 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Approximately 35% of this charge is noncash.","The special items primarily include costs associated with the business optimization initiative pertaining to certain manufacturing and business operations around the world. These actions include the elimination of a number of positions, as we continue to streamline our international operations, rationalize our manufacturing footprint and optimize our general and administrative infrastructure.","Annual savings are expected to total approximately $0.12 per share when fully implemented in 2014. For 2012, savings will equate to approximately $0.05 per diluted share, which is in addition to an incremental $0.03 of savings related to our actions implemented throughout 2011.","Additionally, the Q4 charge includes certain asset impairments principally related to write-down of the company's Greek government bonds. Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 before turning to our financial outlook for 2012.","Starting with sales, worldwide sales totaled $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter and increased 3%. Foreign currency did not impact sales growth. Therefore, growth on a constant currency basis was also 3% and in line with our guidance range of sales growth in the 2% to 3% range.","Excluding the U.S. multisource injectables divestiture, Q4 sales growth was 4% on both a reported and constant currency basis. For the full year, global sales increased 6% to $13.9 billion. Excluding foreign currency and the impact of the U.S. multisource generic injectable divestiture, sales growth was 5%.","In terms of the individual business performances, beginning with BioScience, global BioScience sales of $1.6 billion increased 3% in the fourth quarter, both on a recorded and constant currency basis. For the full year, global Bioscience sales of $6.1 billion increased 7%, or 5% excluding foreign currency. Within the product categories, recombinant sales of $578 million advanced 8%. Excluding foreign currency, sales grew 7% with balance growth between both the U.S. and international markets. On a year-to-date basis, recombinant sales exceeded $2.2 billion, and excluding the negative impact of tenders, full year recombinant growth on a constant currency basis was in mid-single digits, consistent with global market demand.","Moving on to Plasma Proteins. Sales in the quarter were $397 million and declined 4% versus the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, sales declined 2% despite a sequential increase in revenues of approximately 12%. This was primarily a result of a difficult comparison to last year given the phasing of tenders.","In addition, the decline in sales can be attributed to 2 items: timing of plasma-derived Factor VIII shipments related to a large Brazilian tender and temporary supply constraints and delays in the clearance of shipments in China, resulting in backorders of approximately $15 million. Excluding these items, sales growth for the Plasma Protein category was in mid-single digits. For the full year, Plasma Protein sales exceeded $1.4 billion and increased 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis.","In Antibody Therapy, sales of $406 million increased 5%. Excluding foreign currency, sales were up 6%, driven by robust demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID, particularly in the U.S. and a successful launch of our SubQ therapy. As you know, Octapharma returned to the market on a global basis, and we annualized the benefits of their absence in the fourth quarter. Excluding the Octapharma benefit from both years, sales growth in the fourth quarter for Antibody Therapy on a constant currency basis was approximately 10%.","For the full year, Antibody Therapy sales exceeded $1.5 billion and increased 14% versus 2010, or 13% on a constant currency basis, faster than market demand. As we've previously mentioned, our full year results included a benefit of approximately $100 million in sales related to meeting demand previously served by Octapharma.","In the fourth quarter, sales of regenerative medicine, which includes our biosurgery products, totaled $150 million and increased 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis. High single-digit growth of our surgical sealants was offset by lower ACTIFUSE revenues resulting from our planned transition to a direct sales model from ApaTech's former distributor model, as we've discussed in previous quarters. For the full year, regenerative medicine sales of $580 million increased 10%, or 8% on a constant currency basis, despite global weakness in surgical procedures.","Finally, revenues in the other category, which includes of vaccines, totaled $44 million in the fourth quarter and declined 16% versus the prior year. This is primarily due to a benefit in 2010 from onetime orders for our meningitis C vaccine that did not recur in 2011.","In Med Products, global sales in the fourth quarter totaled approximately $2 billion, reflecting an increase of 3%, or 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the U.S. multisource generic injectables divestiture, reported sales growth for Medical Products was 6%, or 5% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, excluding the prior year COLLEAGUE charge, Medical Product sales of $7.8 billion increased 6%, and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%. Also after adjusting for the divestiture, full year sales growth was 8%, or 5% on a constant currency basis.","Now turning to the product categories. Renal sales in the quarter totaled $664 million and increased 6% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign currency, sales growth of 5% was driven primarily by global PD growth of 8%, which was partially offset by the continuing loss of PD patients to another U.S. service provider and lower HD revenues.","I've mentioned we continue to be pleased with the ongoing momentum in patient gains in the U.S. given the recent reimbursement changes and solid patient growth across Latin America and Asia. Sales in the Global Injectables category of $487 million declined 2%, and excluding foreign currency, sales declined 3%. Excluding the divestiture, growth of this category was 10%, or 9% on a constant currency basis, resulting from strong growth in our compounding business, as well as a robust demand for MINI-BAGs and certain injectable drugs.","IV therapy sales totaled $469 million and rose 4% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Contributing to this performance was the addition of Baxa sales to our nutrition franchise, which totaled approximately $20 million, as well as strong growth of IV solutions in the U.S. Infusion systems sales totaled $235 million, reflecting growth of 2% on a reported and constant currency basis. Growth was a result of expanded placements and sales of the Spectrum pump.","Finally, anesthesia sales of $147 million increased 4% on a reported and constant currency basis, driven by solid demand in the U.S. primarily for Suprane and other critical care products. This growth was partially offset by competitive pricing pressures for generic sevoflurane.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin for the company was 51.8% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points versus the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter is primarily result of mixed benefits derived from across the portfolio and improved manufacturing efficiencies in the plasma business. For the full year, gross margin was 51.4%, which is 30 basis points higher than the 2010 gross margin of 51.1% and in line with our full year guidance.","SG&A totaled $748 million in the quarter and increased 6% versus the prior year period. Excluding foreign currency, SG&A increased 5%, as incremental pension expense and investments in a number of promotional activities focused on upcoming new product launches were partially offset by business optimization savings and aggressive management of discretionary spending. For the full year, SG&A increased 7%, with FX contributing 3 percentage points of growth. And as a percent of sales, the SG&A ratio of 21.1% was flat to 2010.","R&D spending accelerated in the fourth quarter to $254 million, representing an increase of 11%, as we continue to fund in advance a number of late-stage programs, several of which Bob mentioned earlier. R&D for the full year totaled $946 million, a new record lever for the company.","The operating margin in the quarter was 23.9%, a sequential improvement of 20 basis points from the third quarter and the highest quarterly operating margin during 2011. For the full year, operating margin was 23.5%, an improvement over 2010 by 20 basis points, primarily a result of gross margin improvements.","Interest expense was $15 million compared to $19 million last year. This reduction is primarily a result of a benefit from higher rate debt that matured last year and higher interest income. The tax rate was 20.4% in the quarter, in line with our expectations and similar to last year's rate.","And finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted EPS was $1.17 per diluted share, an increase of 5%. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.31, representing an 8% increase.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $892 million compared to $935 million in the prior year period. The reduction versus the prior year is a result of $89 million in payments primarily related to the infusion pump recall. On a full year basis, cash flow from operations exceeded $2.8 billion compared to $3 billion last year. After adjusting for pension and the payments principally related to COLLEAGUE, cash flow from operations exceeded $3.3 billion.","Capital expenditures of $960 million were similar to the prior year period, resulting in free cash flow excluding pension and other payments in excess of $2.3 billion. DSO ended the quarter at 53.5 days, an improvement sequentially but one day higher than the year-end DSO within 2010. And inventory turns of 2.7 also improved sequentially but were lower than last year.","And lastly, during 2011, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.6 billion, or a net basis 20 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion higher than our original objective.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012. First, for the full year, we expect earnings of $4.47 to $4.59 per diluted share. This guidance includes a net headwind of approximately $0.25 per diluted share for nonoperational items including incremental pension expense and the impact of foreign currency, particularly in emerging markets.","By line item for the P&L and starting with sales, we project full year sales growth of approximately 2%. Excluding foreign currency, sales growth will be in the 4% to 5% range, as foreign currencies assumed to be -- to have a 2% to 3% impact on top line.","This outlook includes incremental sales from the Baxa and Synovis acquisitions of approximately $160 million and $65 million, respectively. The contribution from these acquisitions is more than offset by the impact of Octapharma, the typical first quarter comparison resulting from the U.S. multisource generic injectable divestiture and other headwinds we've discussed.","We expect the full year gross margin rate for the company to be flat to modestly below the 2011 gross margin of 51.4%, as operational improvements of approximately 50 to 100 basis points are offset by a number of headwinds, primarily dilution from recent transactions and the impact of foreign currency and pension.","We expect SG&A to grow in low-single digits and R&D to grow in low- to mid-single digits for the year. Interest expense for the year will total approximately $80 million and other expense, including noncontrolling interest, will be in the $20 million to $30 million range. We assumed a tax rate of approximately 21.5%, flat with 2011, and a full year average share count of 550 million to 555 million shares, which assumes approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases.","From a cash flow perspective, we plan to generate cash flow from operations of more than $3 billion, which includes an outflow of approximately $250 million related to the finalization of the COLLEAGUE consent order.","Now to expand on full year sales assumptions for each of the businesses. First, on a constant currency basis, we expect Medical Product sales to grow in mid-single digits. By product category, IV therapy sales will grow in high-single digits. As you know, this category includes the nutrition business and will benefit from the Baxa acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter. Anesthesia and Global Injectable sales will increase in mid-single digits, while infusion system sales will decline approximately 5%, reflecting a tough comparison for SIGMA as we complete the consent order later this year. And lastly, we expect renal sales to grow in low-single digits.","For BioScience, we project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, in mid-single digits. This includes low single-digit growth for recombinants, reflecting the impact of recent tenders, and Plasma Protein sales growth in mid-single digits. For Antibody Therapy, sales of low-single digits reflecting robust underlying demand and a modest benefit related to our HyQ launch in the second half of 2012, both of which are partially offset by the impact of Octapharma.","We expect regenerative medicine sales to grow approximately 20%, which includes the addition of Synovis. And finally, we expect the other category within BioScience to decline approximately 5%, driven primarily by lower third-party plasma sales.","For the first quarter, as we mentioned in our press release, we expect earnings per diluted share of $0.98 to $1 and sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 2%. Based on our outlook for foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to be comparable to sales achieved in the first quarter of 2011.","Thank you. And now I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his closing comments.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Bob. As I mentioned earlier, I'm quite pleased with our 2011 financial and operational accomplishments. We achieved organic sales growth of 5%, and earnings per diluted share increased 8% on an adjusted basis. We generated strong sustainable cash flow of more than $2.8 billion and returned significant value to our shareholders. We meaningfully advanced our new product pipeline that's as strong today as it any time in our history. We accelerated the pace of business development initiatives that complement our current businesses, leverage our capabilities and provide enhanced growth in the future. And culturally, we continue to respond to an evolving and demanding environment, with new strategies aimed at enhancing our commercial, operational and scientific effectiveness, while continuing to focus on maximizing growth opportunities across the portfolio and managing costs throughout the company.","As a result, throughout 2011 we strengthened our foundation, and we remain very confident in the long-term growth prospects for our company. We plan to expand upon this later this year when we host an Investor Conference in Chicago. Additional details will be made available from Mary Kay to all of you in the coming weeks.","So with that, thank you, and let's now open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bob, can you update us on your plans for upgrading the old L.A. fractionation facility? And tell us how that plays into your guidance for 2012.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, this is Bob Parkinson, Mike. Let me kind of kick this off, and then Bob and Mary Kay can augment my comments. As you know, we continue to see very steady long-term growth and demand for plasma-based therapies, including IG. And our estimates are that market demand continues to grow and certainly, this strong mid single-digit range over time. We continue to make very good progress in transitioning manufacturing to new L.A. frac. I think last year, we had the majority of our production now move to new L.A. frac. But obviously, given our strong pipeline of new products, our current plans include utilizing capacity. As we discussed before, the old L.A. facility, at least for some number of years, saw. So as a result of that, we need to shut down old L.A. to make the necessary investments to upgrade the facility, so we can keep it in play over the longer term. And we plan on doing that really in the beginning of the second half, Mike, of 2012. We haven't defined a specific date. That will be early in the second half. In the meantime, we've been able to adjust the scale of our operations successfully within the existing global manufacturing footprint between new L.A.; Vienna; Rieti, Italy, and through yield improvements and flexibility in the global network. We've been able to respond appropriately to demand. Now beyond keeping old L.A. frac in commission as we've discussed before, given expansion of IG indications, the continued strong growth of plasma proteins over time, we have initiated a greenfield development process for a new site. We haven't arrived at a final decision in terms of sites. Allegedly expect to do that shortly, and certainly would be in our position in our Investor Conference this fall to share more specifics in terms of the overall capacity demand for plasma proteins, the role that the new facility, the greenfield site, will play in that over time. So that kind of covers kind of the overall situation. But specifically, early second half of the year, we'll take old L.A. out of production to make the necessary upgrade.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And so Bob, is it efficient to wait until the second half so that you can build inventory in the first half of the year? And then how does taking it down the second half impact your ability to launch site 2?","Robert L. Parkinson","Bob, why don't you comment on the inventory build intent [ph] ? That's a good question.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, absolutely. As you know, we've been running very tight on inventory and in fact with very strong demand for our product periodically experiencing backorders. With Octa returning to the market, the expectation is that we'll be in a better position to start building some inventory in advance of the shutdown in the back half of the year and be in better shape. That way that will allow us to maintain supply and support some modest growth as we indicated in our guidance. And I would say from a cost perspective, very modest impact to cost in 2012. Some impact to '13, but I would say a slight headwind, nothing significant. So we're comfortable we'll be able to take it down, do the necessary upgrades and get it back up in production in 2013 and support future growth very nicely.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So coming back to it, how does that impact the ability to really launch HyQ and go after CSL's business?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, I think our approach initially with HyQ, given that is -- this is a paradigm change in treatment, is to have a controlled launch, ensure that those patients and treaters that first go on the product understand how to administer it appropriately, build a good track record and good word of mouth amongst the community and then drive the momentum going forward. So again, our expectations for HyQ for 2012 are modest in any case, but we certainly expect to build a strong foundation so that we can gain some momentum in '13. And we'll have the production available to support that moment as we go forward.","Mary Kay Ladone","And, Mike, I'd also add that Octapharma, in terms of our guidance, we've actually eliminated the $100 million of benefit we received in 2011 so that the guidance of low-single digits, if you excluded that $100 million benefit, would be in high-single digits, which is faster than the market growth.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. Let me just ask one question to Bob Hombach again. The first quarter guidance is -- reflects flat to low-single digit EPS growth. Can you just provide a little bit more color on why the first quarter EPS growth would be lower than the balance of the year?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, a couple of factors there. The first quarter tends to be a lower quarter from a margin perspective, and certainly given where FX rates are at the moment, that certainly poses a bit of a headwind for us as we go into the first quarter here. And really, FX from a headwind standpoint will be there for most of the year, as we indicated in our prepared comments. But as we get through the first quarter, as we annualize out the impact of the divestiture, we did book revenues in the tune of about $50 million to $60 million related to the multisource generic business in the first quarter of last year. That will annualize after the first quarter and have a bit more of a normalized growth rate beyond that.","Operator","David Lewis of Morgan Stanley is online with a question.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe a couple questions for Bob Hombach. Bob, just real quickly on cash flow, you're guiding to cash flow from operations up year-on-year, but there are some pretty significant hits this year, specifically in pension, as well as the deliverables related to COLLEAGUE. Can you just help us understand sort of your net-net? How you think underlying cash trends are trending into '12? And when we see sort of a normalized cash quarter, you think, in 2012?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Until we get the COLLEAGUE consent order done, we won't see a normalized quarter until the third quarter. We're targeting -- July is when the due date is to finalize that. So the amount of cash we have assumed out the door related to COLLEAGUE in 2012 is slightly higher than it is in 2011, and so those are comparable year-over-year and aren't driving a difference. You're right. We did have a pension contribution in early 2011 that we're not expecting to make a pension contribution in 2012. Nothing else really material to discuss around the overall working capital and cash flow assumptions. Again, our guidance, we said, exceeds $3 billion, so we'll see how things play out. But generally, I'm very comfortable with how we've managed the inventory and DSO situations in a very tough environment, particularly DSO. You did see some slight deterioration year-over-year but certainly nothing dramatic, and it's one we're very focused on managing going forward.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Then, maybe just 2 quick ones here. Bob, one more financially and one for Bob Parkinson. Just on the $0.20, $0.25 for currency and pension, can you just give us the relative breakout there between pension and currency or specifically just what the pension expense alone is?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, and maybe I'll spend a bit of time on this because I think it's relevant for a lot of other folks as well. So pension is, as we projected, $0.09 of a headwind year-over-year. And so looking at the residual of $0.16, that's kind of the midpoint of our estimate of the impact of foreign exchange. Now historically, we've talked about FX being a fairly muted impact at the bottom line for the company, a combination of having natural hedges and the use of financial hedges and a bit of a portfolio effect in the emerging markets force over time. And in fact, if you look at 2011, despite volatility where a tailwind for us in the front half of the year and a headwind in the back half, we end the year with approximately $0.03 of a net impact on FX on the full year 2011.","Robert L. Parkinson","Favorable.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. And so net-net, not much of an impact to speak of on the base of $4.31 of earnings. But as we move into 2012, clearly, we're projecting a much more pronounced impact. And maybe I'll just take a minute here and kind of walk everyone through the drivers because I think this is important. As we've talked about, regularly, Baxter has about 60% of our revenues outside the U.S. We've increasingly highlighted for investors that now slightly more than 20% of our revenues come from emerging markets. And in fact, emerging markets have been growing 2 to 3 times the rate of developed markets over the last 5 years. So the mix of our business certainly has shifted towards emerging markets to a much greater degree. As we've highlighted in the past, for developed markets, we have the ability through natural hedges given our manufacturing footprint, which we have in places like Europe and Canada and Japan, Australia and so on. We have some natural hedges there, but also we utilize financial hedges in those developed markets. Now I would pause here to say, as we've talked about in the past, our pipe policy, we hedge 80% of our projected exposures. And by the nature of hedging, when you're looking 12 to 18 to 24 months out, you have to be careful in your projections to ensure that you don't get yourself in an overhead situation, hence, the 80% with a 20% buffer. But what that does mean is we do have some residual exposure muted but some residual exposure in the developed markets. As we said in the past, with emerging markets, we do not hedge. We do not utilize financial hedges, and we have modest natural hedges in some manufacturing facilities in Latin America, Eastern Europe and so on but nothing near the degree we have in the developed markets. And so our bottom line drop to exposure on the emerging markets is much more leveraged. So to frame that exposure for you then, looking at it by region, so within Latin America, from an operating profit perspective that would be exposed to foreign currency, think of that in terms of $300 million to $400 million of annual profit. And that's primarily Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. For Eastern Europe, which is primarily Russia, Poland and Turkey, again, about $300 million of operating profit on an annual basis. And then in Asia Pacific, and there we would exclude Japan, Australia, New Zealand and China because of the stability of the currency, so all of Asia excluding those 3 is another roughly $300 million of operating profit on an annual basis. So you add that up. That's $900 million to $1 billion of profit exposed to currency in emerging markets. And as you've seen, there's been quite a bit of volatility, and given where we're sitting today and where rates are today relative to where they were on average in 2011, if you assume an 8% to 10% weakening across that basket of emerging market currencies, that's $80 million to $100 million of incremental exposure that we're factoring in here. And you add to that the slight 20% residual impact from the developed markets that goes unhedged, and that's how we get into this kind of $0.15 to $0.18 range of FX exposure. Now, as you would imagine, given the volatility, we've assumed somewhat conservative rates relative to where market rates are today. There's been of bit of a run-up here in the last few days, but given the volatility, I hesitate to call it very conservative. And so that's the picture. But if I step back and think about as a large U.S. multinational corporation in thinking about the long run, being along the emerging markets, whether it's from a growth perspective or currency perspective, is exactly where we want to be. We continue to see great opportunities there, but in times of financial crisis like this, where the correlation between those currencies and the U.S. dollar is all going one way, it creates this kind of outsized exposure that we're having to factor into our guidance here for 2012. So thanks for bearing with me, but I think it's important that people understand the breadth of the issue for us.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I will -- just maybe one more quick one for Bob Parkinson. And Bob, there's been a lot of concerns here in the quarter regarding European austerity. You've talked a lot about old Europe pressures. I guess we've been surprised about where that pressure's coming from. I think it's a little different than where the investor sees within your plasma business versus your injectable and your nutritional business. Can you just sort of talk to us in the way you're see the pressure and which businesses for Baxter are proving to be more robust? And then where -- which businesses are seeing sort of more pharmaceutical-like pressure?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. I mean, so the negative impact of the austerity measures, first of all, is just kind of what I call general softness, David, and underlying demand. But these are the kind of things we see globally. So surgical procedures and things of that nature are somewhat softer than what's been reflected historically. So now we'd run across virtually all our businesses, certainly even our IV business and so on and so forth. But the other pressure that's probably more pronounced and is more associated with our BioScience business would be pricing pressures with governments who clearly are under the gun to implement austerity measures. And given healthcare spend and well-large item that represents on national budgets and so on, we continue to see governments virtually unilaterally implementing various pricing actions, and that impact is more pronounced in things like, say, biosurgery where people are making trade-off decisions in terms of clinical options that they have but also, most of our BioScience products, which are more expensive. So as an example, countries like France implement actions in terms of taking prices down. It's a haircut, David. So it's not as pronounced as what you would see with some of the tender actions, I would say, on hemophilia because encouragingly, we haven't seen the expansion beyond the Anglo markets of the tender activity for hemophilia. But -- so we think we've captured in our guidance for next year those known pricing actions that will be taken on a country-by-country basis. We also think we've reflected kind of the underlying softness of demand. But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that given the extreme austerity measures and pressures that exist that unlike the U.S. governments in Europe, most notably, really have a history of implementing unilateral actions for which there's not a lot of control. We think we've captured it, but like I say, given the environment, I think, we have to be cognizant that there could be more there. And by the way, this is an ongoing thing. I mean, this is -- it's why I talk about dealing with the new environment in our company, in our culture and so on. This isn't something that's going to pass through this year in  -- or through the end of 2012. It's going to be with us.","Mary Kay Ladone","David, I would just add that what we included in our 2012 guidance was what we had discussed throughout the fourth quarter of about $30 million to $40 million related to austerity measures. That's pretty balanced between both BioScience and Medical Products. I'd just highlight that the majority of the impact is really coming from vaccines within the BioScience business and within Med Products. It's really between IV therapy, where our nutrition products are being impacted, and then some impact in renal.","Operator","David Roman of Goldman Sachs is online with a question.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you can walk through the impact of M&A on the guidance. I know you've provided some perspective with respect to dilution at the time you announced the deals. But how much of the dilution that you've provided then is either going through GAAP or ongoing earnings?","Robert L. Parkinson","Bob, go ahead.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. So within the guidance that we provided, the incremental dilution is about $0.05. And a couple things I'd note, one is we did take about $0.01 roughly in Q4 here because we did close the Baxa acquisition a little earlier than we thought. So some of what we were projecting for '12 occurred in '11. And then, as we've looked at this further, there are certain aspects of the transaction costs that were likely to special out going forward. But the big chunk of this really is noncash amortization related to a deal premium that you have to run through. In our case, we'll go through cost of goods sold, and that's about $35 million of incremental headwind that's going to run through margin here. So again, about $0.05 incremental, but we did take $0.01, roughly, in Q4.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as I look at the Plasma Protein business, the issues about timing of imports in China, I think you had talked about that last quarter, as well a new product, the delay on a large tender for PD Factor VIII in Brazil. Are those issues that we should think about as being ongoing for the next several quarters? Or will those normalize at some point, whereby that business gets back to sort of stable underlying growth on a reported basis?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. Certainly, Brazil for sure is a timing issue, and we're hoping to continue to accelerate into China. Without them it becomes -- it is a great growth opportunity. So yes, you should see normalized growth rates here in 2012 for that category.","Mary Kay Ladone","Although I would mention, David, that tenders tend to be volatile, and we can see shifts from quarter-to-quarter, so just to highlight that.","Robert L. Parkinson","David, the one thing I would add to the China situation, there's been local action by the Chinese government to further scale back some of their local plasma collection operations in the country. So this importation of albumin in China would appear to be something that is going to be sustainable for the near future, certainly over the next few years, I think, given some of the local issues they manage through.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on the new products, Bob, in your prepared remarks, you talked about SubQ both capturing share from your competitors, as well as converting some of your own business. When we think about things like HyQ and some of the other products that you\u2019ll launch through the end of '12 and into '13, should we think about those more share capture, market growing, cannibalistic? How do you sort of rate that?","Robert L. Parkinson","It will be some of the each. Over time, it will be -- it should translate into both share gains, but I would say also at a price premium. And as Bob pointed out, hopefully when we get approval between then and at the end of the year, we're going to have a very controlled launch, understand what the receptivity of product is, which then will titrate the kind of the marketing objectives between share gain pricing and so on, recognizing in the near term, managing through supply of IG. But the value in HyQ should be manifested in both share gains and pricing.","Operator","Rick Wise of Leerink Swann is online a question.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can I start with gross margin? Bob, you talked about gross margin being essentially flat for the year. But could you talk about it -- how should we think about the quarterly flow and then, particularly, as it relates to old L.A. shutdown, temporary shutdown. Should we assume second half gross margins are lower? Can you -- and maybe if you could help us think through that.","Robert J. Hombach","No. I mean, I do think that old L.A. in and of itself given that it's back half that will take it down and how that rolls through our P&L. As you know, there's a bit of a delay given the long lead time of that. So most of that impact will actually impact 2013, but again, it's a slight impact. It's not that significant. And so I wouldn't expect anything unusual quarter-by-quarter for margin, with the exception of FX. So as you know, we talked about FX as a tailwind in our Q2 margin in 2011, and then, it snapped back to a headwind given the dramatic move in emerging market currencies. Because there is a dichotomy in terms of how margin affects -- FX affects our margin between the developed markets where we have natural hedges and financial hedges. That tends to mute the margin impact, but as reported sales come down that can actually result in a higher reported margin percentage. But on the emerging markets side because it's more highly leveraged and we don't have the financial hedges or the natural hedges in place, that tends to be more of a straight drop-through, and so it really does matter which currencies are moving which way here between the developed markets and emerging markets. So the one caveat to my comment really is that the tailwind in Q2 and the headwind in Q3 versus where we're at here with 2012 in our initial guidance. That would be the only tweak. But no, I don't think there's anything dramatic there.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, Rick, I'd add that I think Bob mentioned earlier, our Q1 gross margin is expected really to be flat to 2011 Q1. And Q2 generally, we do see a higher margin, really due to the mix of our sales, which is benefited by the FSME vaccine, which is very high margin. So typically, Q2 is our highest gross margin quarter of the year, and then, in Q3 and Q4, it moderates a little bit.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. If I could turn to the plasma market, you've talked about some of the market dynamics, but it seems like as we look at 2012, it's a lot -- the outlook is a lot different than a year ago. Grifols, Talecris now combined. I mean, 2 questions. Can you talk about the dynamics of the consolidation? The Octapharma, $100 million you've taken out. Are you seeing them on track to actually do that? Or is that a conservative assumption? And maybe a little bit about collections and supply, demand. I'd appreciate it.","Robert L. Parkinson","Now let me -- Rick, this is Bob Parkinson. Let me take the first part, and maybe you could address, Bob, collections. And so I really don't want to comment in terms of competitive response, and so on. I know there's been a lot of changes in the market, frankly, as a result of what we've seen. Clearly, Octapharma has gotten a lot of the business back already that we gained from them last year. Whether our assumption is conservative or not is yet to be seen. But I think it is fair to say that most of the volume that we gained will get lost back over time to them, okay?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. And Rick, the way I would think about that is that given how the market break down for us in the U.S., where about half of our sales are in kind of the hospital acute episodic use versus the chronic space. Our focus, particularly with SubQ and then with HyQ, is really going to be grow out the chronic space. And so with that differentiation, we think we have great opportunities there. And where they play today given their 5% concentration in the -- which is kind of a suboptimal product relative to what most other competitors have with a 10% concentration, likely, they're going to play in the more price-sensitive hospital space, in any case. So for us, it's about directing product to those parts of the channel that we think we have the best opportunity to win. And if that means some of the price-sensitive accounts we lose, then so be it. So it's more of how we're focusing on where we want to drive growth in the future than trying to fight it out with them hospital to hospital.","Robert L. Parkinson","What was your question, Rick, on inventories again?","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","It was sort of supply, demand. I mean, given the weakening economy, your collection's growing. Just wondering how you see the -- just that -- the background there for Plasma Protein.","Robert L. Parkinson","Actually the economic environment in the area of Plasma Proteins, in general, certainly in IG, frankly, we haven't seen -- little to no effect really in terms of underlying demand. So I think in terms of the projection of market growth both in '12 and going forward beyond that, very consistent with what we've communicated before, I would say, strong single digit, mid-single digits. And as for the total market and obviously with the early encouraging feedback on our SubQ product, the hopeful launch of HyQ and then indication expansions with MMN and so on over time, it's clearly our aspiration to grow this business at a faster rate than the overall market. But overall, Rick, pretty stable.","Operator","Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch is online with a question.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you hear me okay?","Robert L. Parkinson","We can, Bob. Go ahead.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Just 2 quick questions, one on the Analyst Day upcoming and then another on your recent press release on Alzheimer's and the futility analysis that was done. On the futility analysis, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more specifically about what we should and should not read into that analysis and the 20% threshold. It's my understanding that relates specifically to safety and says nothing about efficacy related to that 20%. Is that the right way to look at it? I just want to clarify the point, because it has impacted the stock.","Robert L. Parkinson","Bob, let me -- as Mary Kay mentioned at the outset, Dr. Norbert Riedel's with us this morning. I'm going to ask Norbert to respond to your question on this. Go ahead, Norbert.","Norbert G. Riedel","Okay, so maybe just for a little bit of context, the Phase III trial that is ongoing has about 390 patients enrolled. Patients are on therapy for 18 months. And the futility analysis was done on a 120-patient part of that trial that has already completed 18 months on therapy. And the Alzheimer's consortium who we worked with to conduct this trial had a statistical group determine the parameters of the futility analysis for it to be truly within the spirit of our futility analysis and not become de facto in interim analysis. And that's where they set the cutoff for the assessment. The assessment was done and says that there is a better than 20% probability of reaching the endpoint, the primary endpoint defined for the trial. And there's also no indication from a safety point of view as to why the trial should not proceed. Therefore, the recommendation that the trial should really proceed as planned and our communication that we will be initiating a second conservatory trial with the exact same trial design. So specifically answering your question, I did not expect a safety signal or a safety concern primarily because immunoglobulin GAMMAGARD is used and has been used for many, many years in primary immune deficiency and has a very well defined and also, would say, a very favorable safety profile. So safety was not really the issue, but it was looked at anyway by the DSMB. But it was about a probability assessment that we will indeed be able to achieve the primary endpoint. And so I'm encouraged by that. I think it supports also the Phase II trial data that we have seen. It supports our hypothesis that a multifactorial disease like Alzheimer's disease will likely benefit much from a multifactorial treatment approach like the complexity of the immunoglobulins that we offer these patients. And I think it just overall continues to make me cautiously optimistic that this might indeed be a way of going after treating the disease.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And can you just kind of remind me of the primary endpoint of the study?","Norbert G. Riedel","The primary endpoint is 2 well-defined endpoints that are generally used in the space of Alzheimer's disease. One is an assessment scale that is a cognitive function assessment scale that is used, and the other is an overall function of the patient that has to do with activities of daily life and so on, so parameters that we have selected together with the FDA and that are consistent with endpoints in Alzheimer's trials typically look for.","Robert L. Parkinson","What's your question on Investors Day, then, Bob?","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, on the Investors Day, just some thoughts on specific timing and just things that you're going to be covering on that day that you think that we should be aware of in terms of the meeting and things that we should preparing for?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, in terms of the specific time and day, Mary Kay will be out to all of you shortly. We're nailing that down. It will be this fall, okay? So -- but when, Mary Kay, within what time frame?","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, within a week or 2.","Robert L. Parkinson","Within a week or 2, we'll get you all the specifics, so in terms of the logistical part of it. But what's our objective? As we traditionally have done, is to give you a longer-term view of where we see our company going. And one of the reasons, as I've commented before, that we have not had an Investor Day for a while, I think, is really largely a result of kind of the external environment and recognizing the volatility that existed. Candidly, we want to get a little better line of sight both in terms of our operating plan for 2012 as a baseline but to get our arms around some of the moving parts. So I think you can interpret the fact that we're scheduling that as positive in terms of our sense that we think we more definitively have our arms around where we're going and so on. And so, it's a bit of, I think, a sense of confidence as you gathered from my prepared comments. We continue to be very confident in the long-term outlook of the company. And we understand all of you have been waiting for a while to get a sense of something beyond the immediate year that we're operating in, and so that's really the primary objective in terms of what's going to drive the growth of the company going forward and really at what rate do we see revenue growing out over the coming years, as well as projected earnings growth and so on. So we look forward to getting together with everybody.","Operator","Larry Keusch of Morgan Keegan is online with a question.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering, Bob, if you might just -- I know we spent some time on Octapharma, but maybe just from a global perspective, just help us understand sort of what you're seeing on price globally. Again, I understand you don't want to, I guess, like compete in the most price-sensitive countries or hospitals in the U.S., but just what you're doing?","Robert L. Parkinson","I'll just comment to some degree, maybe not satisfying you specifically. But from our perspective, I mean, obviously we're seeing fairly stable prices in terms of what we charge our customers around the world. I'll kind of leave it at that.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, obviously, emerging markets are already a big proportion of your business. There's a lot of reasons to believe that, and Bob Hombach mentioned that they're clearly the right place to invest, and this is where you want to go long term. I think you've sort of thrown out 30% as kind of as a percent of sales of where you think these markets can go. Can you sort of just remind us of how you're thinking about when you might kind of reach that bogey, and how we should be thinking about just the margin profile as the mix of emerging markets gets bigger?","Robert L. Parkinson","Let me make a couple of comments, and then Mary Kay and Bob can add to this. I mean, first of all, this will be an area of focus at our investor conference this fall. I think we'll hone in, provide a little more structure and definition on the opportunity that we see long term associated with emerging, developing markets. I think the number that you cited clearly is a reasonable aspiration that we may be able to get to within a -- say, within a 5-year period of time to give you a little of framework. In terms of profitability, actually, interestingly, if you look at, say, pretax operating margin as a percent of sales in these markets, it actually aligns fairly closely with what we see in developed markets. Obviously, the cost of doing business in not all, but many of these markets is much less. And also, we're supporting this growth through overhead structure. Whether it's here in our corporate offices or in our regional offices, that can be further leveraged. So I don't see, over time, a dilution to the profile of our P&L as we grow emerging and developing market revenues at a faster rate than the rest of the company. So that's probably \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Mary Kay or Bob, if you want to add to that...","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I was just going to say, I mean, we've tended to enter these markets over time in the IV or renal space, but the opportunity to have these economies move up the scale and start devoting more of their GDP towards healthcare, some of our higher-end products, particularly biologics, become more attractive. And so the opportunity to increase margin through further penetration of the biologics portfolio and the higher-end products within our Med Product space, like some of our nutrition and anesthesia products, we actually see nice margin opportunities for improvement going forward there.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, terrific. And then just one last housekeeping item for Bob Hombach. I don't know if I missed this on the call, but CapEx spending for 2012 and how much is sort of contemplated in there for the improvements being made to the old L.A. frac? And then also what are you assuming in your guidance for the R&D tax credit?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I mean, the R&D tax credit for us is a fairly small item, so not material. As it relates to CapEx, once again, we're looking at about $1 billion. That may go up a little bit pending the timing of when we launch the greenfield site that we've talked about for the plasma business, but thinking about it at approximately $1 billion at this point is a good way to think about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to confirm -- sorry if I missed this in the beginning, but your guidance does include both the Baxa acquisition, and it does it include Synovis? I know that hasn't closed yet but...","Robert J. Hombach","Yes.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And in total, what was the total dilution from both of those deals that's included within the adjusted number?","Robert J. Hombach","That was in the adjusted number. We talked about $0.05 incremental in '12. We took about $0.01 in Q4 here, withholding backs a little bit early. So that's the number. As I mentioned, there are some onetime costs related to Synovis as a public company that we'll think about specialing out, but think about $0.05, again, almost exclusively, noncash amortization that's required by purchase accounting that runs through margin.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And earlier, I thought you had said that, that was running through cost of goods sold. Is that correct?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, the aftermarket, yes.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. and then I guess, Bob, just a bigger picture question. I know biosimilars or something that in the past you had kind of shied away from. Obviously, you just announced a recent deal and there seems to be a little bit clarity. Can you just maybe expand about your thoughts on biosimilars and just kind of where you see Baxter participating over the longer haul? And then any specifics on products that you could just...","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. Well, Kristen, I mean with the deal with Momenta, we think this could be a meaningful opportunity for our company. And historically, it wasn't so much that we shied away from it. I think we always felt fundamentally we were probably as well positioned as anyone to participate in the market. Clearly, there was and continues to be to a great degree some ambiguity in the regulatory pathway. But if you look at Baxter's expertise and biologic manufacturing, all these are drugs that are administered -- that are injectable, which plays to a Baxter strength in terms of packaging, formulation, technology and so on. And obviously, given our global channel presence, again, I think we're -- we've always been as well positioned as anyone. The reason we've been historically kind of noncommittal was one, lacking definition on the regulatory pathway. But with the collaboration with Momenta, candidly, we think we have potentially a fundamental differentiator here, at least on the 6 compounds that are part of the deal that we did with Momenta. Not to get into a lot of detail on their technology, but at least with one biologic, they have a proven track record of applying their technology, bringing it through regulatory approval and getting it launched to the market. And we're excited about the prospects of potentially being able to minimize the clinical development spend given their ability to characterize these biosimilars more effectively and accelerate the time to market as well as lower cost to market, as well. So with the Momenta deal, I think that was really the key thing that's kind of pushed us over the edge to say, okay, we had to be able to leverage the other Baxter strengths and take advantage of this is as a significant opportunity. So we're quite excited about it.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, I guess, congratulations on stealing Jean-Luc Butel from Medtronic. Anything different that we can expect from him with international business?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, I don't think so. He knows -- since Ludwig moved, the Ludwig Hantson moved from the international role to run BioScience, which I would say he's doing an outstanding job with our pipeline and clinical development throughout BioScience. In the meantime, the regional presidents in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific have reported directly to me. I think that's worked fine, but I think that as we discussed in the call this morning, given the opportunity in emerging developing markets, there's probably very few people in the industry that have Jean-Luc's expertise and depth of experience in operating in these markets around the world. And I think he will bring real value add to and direction to our international regions, so as well as depth of experience in our senior leadership team overall. So we couldn't be more pleased to have Jean-Luc come on board in a few weeks.","Operator","Our final question comes from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I\u2019ve got one question on some of your new products in IVIG that you mentioned, reason and forthcoming launches of SubQ and HyQ and the offsetting impact on the return of Octa. Can you give us a sense of how SubQ has impacted your business so far? Understanding HyQ is significantly more differentiated, SubQ also seems to be having a positive effect. Do you think it's -- if you can quantify that, is it $10 million or $50 million on an annualized basis or 1% or 2% incremental to your business? And then maybe at a higher level, looking at both SubQ and HyQ, do you think that they reach a level in 2012 to offset the $100 million you've talked about, giving back to the Octa? Or, any kind of color would be great on that. I've got one follow-up.","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. Well, let me just maybe give you a general response and then maybe Mary Kay or Bob can maybe fill in some of the details. I mean, obviously, we're encouraged by the early response to the SubQ. I mean, we are seeing a conversion of patients from competitive product, as well as conversion of Baxter products on the IV form as well. So we're -- and with the low injection-site reaction, in terms of side effects, which is very -- which is in the label, and that's been validated, I think, in terms of actual clinical experience. Having said that, I think it's too early maybe to quantify, Matt, how much of the Octapharma loss could be offset with the 10% SubQ. But I think it's fair to say that some of it will be -- I'll stop there. Bob or Mary Kay, do you want to add to that?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. I mean, very excited about how SubQ has gone so far. But again, I would think about 2012 as a little bit of an unusual year given taking the old L.A. facility down. It's going to constrain our ability to grow faster than what we've described here to some degree. And so it's really about seeding the market for what we think will be a very successful HyQ launch. And so it will be more over time than an immediate impact in '12 in terms of what it might do for our business, but clearly, it is being well received. And again it's the fastest growing segment of the PID market, so we're very happy to be participating in it.","Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's great. And then lastly on recombinants with Q4, we saw a pretty significant step-up in the second half of the year. And I wanted to get a sense as you head into 2012, we got your growth expectations in your prepared remarks. But Dr. Riedel's been talking about the peer-reviewed paper on inhibitor formation published last summer. Can you give a sense -- and maybe Doctor Riedel can answer this -- as to how that paper -- what kind of impact has that had on the thinking across coalitions and folks in the community? And are you starting to see an impact? Or do you expect to see an impact, whether it's in tenders or utilization?","Norbert G. Riedel","Well, maybe I'll start with just touching on the paper that you referred to, the meta-analysis, which really for the first time, provides a rather encompassing comparison between B-domain deleted Factor VIII and full-length Factor VIII. And I keep pointing out that our ADVATE as the goal standard of therapy in hemophilia A is a full-length recombinant Factor VIII that is manufactured completely in the absence of any proteins added at any point in the process of making the finished product. And I have always believed that a full-length Factor VIII most closely mimics what is naturally occurring when you have a Factor VIII. And the data in the meta-analysis suggests that B-domain deleted VIII, or Factor VIII, has a much higher incidence of inhibitor formation, about a 7 fault [ph] higher incidence than the full-length Factor VIII. And with respect to what we call high titre antibodies, which are the most problematic for a hemophilia patient and 11 times higher incidence rate. And so we have been clear with the results that our goal continues to be to optimize ADVATE therapy. Our longer-acting Factor VIII is fundamentally an ADVATE molecule with a minor tweak that we put on the molecule and continues our approach to working with full-length Factor VIII. And I think when you look at just the market share of B-domain deleted Factor VIII, today it is actually very small and so I believe that, given the choice, that full-length Factor VIII is very attractive therapy. And as I mentioned, it is much closer to the natural way of dealing with bleeds or stopping the bleeds.","Robert J. Hombach","And fair to say, I think that we're starting to see this resonate more with treaters and with patients, both the Profi Label as well as the meta-analysis. But that's part of our challenge in '12 is to drive that into the market and make it happen. So that's what we're focused on.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer; and Ludwig Hantson, President, BioScience.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thanks for calling in. As you all saw on the press release that was issued earlier this morning, Baxter reported solid financial results for the third quarter, which met expectations. Adjusted earnings increased 4% to $1.19 per diluted share, and worldwide sales, excluding currency, increased 9%. Excluding Gambro and foreign currency, Baxter's sales advanced 6%.","We've also updated our financial guidance for the full year, which now includes sales growth of approximately 7% on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings of $4.65 to $4.67 per diluted share. As a reminder, guidance reflects the impact of the Gambro acquisition.","While we continue to meet our financial objectives, Baxter's global presence and diversified health-care model, together with the advancement we've made to our business portfolio and new product pipeline, we're focused on driving improved access to care across key franchises in both developed and emerging markets, better outcomes for patients and enhanced value for our shareholders.","During the quarter, we announced a number of business development initiatives and achieved an array of new product pipeline milestones. Some recent highlights include finalizing the acquisition of Gambro AB, a privately held global medical technology company and leader in dialysis products, which further enhances Baxter's global renal leadership and provides a comprehensive product and therapies portfolio to meet the needs of patients in the large and growing dialysis market. The acquisition provides a number of long-term growth opportunities for Baxter around the world, as well as significant cost synergies. Second, the company executed an exclusive distribution and license agreement with JW Holdings for parenteral nutrition products containing a novel formulation of Omega 3 lipids. The agreement remains in effect for 10 years following the first product launch, and Baxter has specified rights to certain additional nutritional products that JW Holdings may develop or produce in the future. And third, we announced an exclusive collaboration with Coherus Biosciences to develop and commercialize a biosimilar to etanercept in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other markets. Biosimilars, as you know, are intended to be used in place of existing branded biologics to treat a range of chronic and often life-threatening diseases and have the potential to reduce costs and expand patient access. This collaboration builds on Baxter's ongoing relationship with Momenta, expands Baxter's evolving biosimilar platform focused in the areas of immunology and oncology and may support an accelerated entry for Baxter into this market within the time frame of our long-range plan.","From a pipeline perspective, we launched HyQvia in Germany as a replacement therapy for adults with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. HyQvia offers patients the ability to administer their treatment in a single subcutaneous site every 3 to 4 weeks and combines key benefits of intravenous and subcutaneous administration into one product. Additional EU market launches are scheduled for the coming months. In the U.S., our regulatory activities remain on track, and we expect to complete preclinical testing and file the amendment to our BLA before the end of the year.","We've launched RIXUBIS in the U.S., which is the only approved recombinant Factor IX treatment for routine prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes in adults with hemophilia B. RIXUBIS is also the first new therapy approved in hemophilia B in more than 15 years. In the global market, that's more than $1 billion of revenue annually. In the fourth quarter, Baxter intends to file RIXUBIS for approval in Europe and Japan and for pediatric indications in the United States.","Also during the quarter, we continued to expand our parenteral nutrition portfolio with the launch of CLINOMEL in China and OLIMEL in Brazil, and also received FDA approval for CLINOLIPID, an olive oil-based lipid emulsion used in parenteral nutrition, indicated for adults.","And finally, we received EMA approval to include PK-guided dosing information in ADVATE's EU label. This information is based on a Phase IV prophylaxis clinical study and offers some patients the option of a dosing schedule of every 3 days. In the study, PK-guided and standard prophylactic dosing regimens were comparably effective in reducing annual bleeding rates. This advancement offers clinicians and patients information that enables them to personalize their treatment regimens, with the goal of fewer infusions per year while effectively reducing bleeds. As you know, promotion of this label, along with ADVATE's strong efficacy and safety profile, has contributed to share gains and accelerated sales growth of our hemophilia franchise over the last 2 years. And given the recent focus on our hemophilia franchise, of course, we're happy to provide further perspectives on this topic during the Q&A this morning.","So in closing, while the global macroeconomic environment continues to be quite demanding, we remain focused on operational performance, achieving R&D milestones and executing on a number of initiatives to enhance our growth profile. And while we're certainly not without challenges, Baxter's portfolio remains strong, and we'll continue to benefit from our focus on lifesaving therapies in the 4 growth vectors that we've discussed that support our strategic objectives and enable us to fulfill our mission. We remain confident in our business model, our ability to innovate and the prospects for growth in the future of our company.","So with that, I'd now like to ask Bob to review the financial results for the third quarter and also guidance for the remainder of 2013. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the third quarter, excluding special items, increased 4% to $1.19 per diluted share, which was in line with our guidance. As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP results include after-tax special items of $111 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for costs associated with the acquisition of Gambro, increased litigation reserves and payments associated with previously announced collaborations.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of 2013. Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $3.8 billion advanced 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Given the timing of the close of the Gambro transaction later in the third quarter, Gambro revenues for the quarter were $100 million. So excluding Gambro, Baxter's sales rose 6% on both a reported and constant currency basis, in line with our guidance. Organic growth in the base Baxter business improved sequentially by approximately 200 basis points, driven by accelerated growth in emerging markets, as we benefited from certain government collaborations, as well as the timing of tenders, high single-digit growth of hemophilia and U.S. immunoglobulin therapies and strong performance of certain injectable therapies, specifically cyclophosphamide, a generic oncology drug.","In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales exceeded $1.6 billion and advanced 6% in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Within the product categories, hemophilia sales of $851 million increased 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This strong performance was the result of solid global demand for ADVATE, given our label expansion in the U.S. and Europe, and for FEIBA, an inhibitor therapy. This was augmented by a benefit from the timing of certain tenders, as well as shipments to Brazil as part of our ongoing partnership with Hemobras to enhance access to recombinant Factor VIII therapy in the world's third largest hemophilia market. As you may recall, last year, we signed a 10-year agreement with Brazil to be the exclusive provider of recombinant Factor VIII therapy as we work together on a technology transfer to support development of local manufacturing capabilities. We expect peak annual sales related to this partnership to approach $200 million by 2017.","In BioTherapeutics, sales of $532 million increased 3% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the U.S. for immunoglobulin therapies improved sequentially by approximately $35 million, with growth in the quarter in high single digits, driven by improved product availability and accelerated demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID. This was partially offset by lower sales in international markets as a result of our decisions to exit certain markets due to previous supply constraints.","Sales in BioSurgery of $173 million increased 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This performance was driven by Synovis and solid growth in international markets, including sales for surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL.","Finally, vaccines' revenues totaled $64 million in the quarter and increased 8%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 5%, driven primarily by modest milestone payments related to our ongoing collaborations on the development of influenza vaccines and strong performance of our FSME vaccine.","In Medical Products, global sales in the third quarter exceeded $2.1 billion and increased 10%. Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 11%. Excluding Gambro revenues, Medical Products sales grew 5%, or 6% on a constant currency basis.","Within the product categories, Renal sales totaled $746 million and increased 19%. On a constant currency basis, sales advanced 21%. Excluding Gambro, Renal sales increased 3%, or 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong PD patient gains in the U.S. and emerging markets.","Sales in the Fluid Systems category of $792 million increased 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Performance continued to be driven by solid demand for IV solutions and price improvements for the injectable oncology drug cyclophosphamide, which collectively more than offset lower sales of infusion pumps.","Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $372 million, reflecting an increase of 1% on a reported and constant currency basis. Strong global anesthesia growth of 8% offset lower sales in nutritional therapies resulting from supplier shortages of distributed vitamins and lipids.","Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $244 million and declined 5% on a reported basis or 4% on a constant currency basis. This performance can be attributed to the timing of shipments and our focus on building demand as we've alleviated supply constraints experienced earlier this year. We expect this business to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter of 52.0% was lower than the prior year period by 10 basis points and reflects the impact of Gambro. Excluding Gambro, Baxter's gross margin expanded by 30 basis points versus the prior year gross margin of 52.1% and also improved sequentially by 10 basis points. The gross margin improvement in Baxter's base business was a result of mix and price improvements, which offset a number of headwinds, including foreign currency, incremental pension expense, medical device tax and government austerity measures.","SG&A totaled $827 million and increased 11%, with Gambro contributing 4 points of growth. Excluding Gambro, SG&A increased 7%, driven primarily by incremental pension expense and investments we are making in promotional and marketing initiatives, new product launches and within international markets to enhance our global presence. In total, these items more than offset the benefits related to tight expense management of discretionary spending and operational efficiencies derived from our process reengineering efforts.","R&D spending in the quarter of $265 million increased 10% versus the prior year and includes 3 points of growth related to Gambro. Excluding Gambro, growth continues to be driven by the investments we are making to advance a number of our programs in our pipeline, including those in our leading hemophilia franchise, our Home HD therapy and as well as earlier-stage programs and key collaborations.","The operating margin in the quarter of 23.0% is 80 basis points lower than last year's operating margin of 23.8%. However, excluding Gambro, Baxter's operating margin was modestly higher than Q3 last year.","Interest expense was $45 million compared to $25 million last year, due to new debt issuances within the last year to fund both the Covington plasma manufacturing site and the Gambro acquisition.","The tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter, generally in line with our full year expectation. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 increased 4%.","Turning to cash flow. For the quarter, cash flow from operations of $966 million improved by more than $200 million versus Q3 last year. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations exceeded $2.1 billion and is lower than the prior year by $46 million, largely due to the timing of U.S. tax payments, a large receivable collection in Spain last year and an outflow related to inventory.","DSO ended the quarter at 59.4 days and was higher than the prior year period by 2.4 days. Excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 55.1 days and was lower than the prior year by almost 2 days.","Inventory turns of 2.1 are lower than the 2.3 turns in the prior year period. As you know, we have increased inventory levels to support growing demand, particularly in plasma proteins, as we remain on track to benefit from enhanced capacity in the second half of this year.","Lastly, on a year-to-date basis, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares for $863 million, or, on a net basis, 4 million shares for $428 million, in line with our full year objective.","Finally, let me conclude by comments this morning by confirming our financial outlook for the full year 2013. As you saw on the press release, we confirmed guidance within our previously stated range and now expect earnings of $4.65 to $4.67 per diluted share. This includes the impact of the Gambro acquisition. By line item of the P&L and starting with sales, we now expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 7%, and this includes a contribution from Gambro revenues of approximately $500 million. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 6%. Excluding Gambro, we continue to expect the Baxter sales -- Baxter base sales to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis.","For the full year, we expect gross margin for the company to be approximately 51.0%. In terms of expenses, we expect SG&A to increase in high single digits and R&D to grow in mid-single digits. Both line items reflect leverage in the Baxter base expense along with the addition of Gambro. We expect interest expense to total approximately $140 million and other income to total approximately $25 million for the full year. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 22%, and we expect a full year average share count of approximately 550 million shares, which assumes approximately 400 million in net share repurchases. From a cash flow perspective, our plan remains to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.3 billion, which excludes any cash costs associated with the Gambro transaction. We continue to expect capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.7 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.","Let me move to sales and expand our assumptions for the 2 businesses in the major product categories. Beginning with Medical Products, on a constant currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro, we expect sales growth of approximately 10%. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 3% to 4%. Specifically, we expect Baxter's Renal sales to grow in low single digits, which will be augmented by the contribution from Gambro revenues totaling approximately $500 million. We continue to expect Fluid Systems sales, which includes IV solutions, infusion pumps and access sets, to grow in mid-single digits. We expect Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in low single digits. And we expect our BioPharma Solutions sales to be flat to slightly down for the year.","For BioScience, we continue to project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, in the 4% to 5% range. Our outlook includes mid-single-digit growth in our hemophilia franchise, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived Factor VIII and Factor IX therapies and FEIBA, an inhibitor treatment. Growth will continue to be fueled by underlying demand for ADVATE, where we continue to realize benefits associated with the new expanded label, including competitive gains and conversion to prophylaxis treatment. We now expect low-single-digit growth in BioTherapeutics, which includes IG therapies, albumin and Alpha-1 treatments. While our enhanced capacity will support accelerated volume growth in the U.S., we have lowered our guidance to reflect an expected decline in sales of low single digits in the fourth quarter, which is due entirely to the timing of albumin shipments in China. In BioSurgery, we expect mid- to high-single-digit growth. And finally, we now expect our vaccine franchise to grow more than 15%.","As mentioned in our press release, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.24 to $1.26. Including revenues associated with the Gambro acquisition of approximately $400 million, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 14% to 15%, or approximately 12% to 13% including the impact of foreign currency. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales at constant currency rates to grow approximately 3% to 4%.","Thanks. And now let me open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 30 days at www.baxter.com.","Our first question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to start with cyclophosphamide, which you called out in your prepared remarks as driving some strength in the quarter. That's also a product that you've called out as potentially facing generic competition on a go-forward basis. So maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about your thinking around the evolution of that product and maybe if you could throw Suprane into the mix there, as that's also another product, I think, that has the potential to face new competition as well.","Robert L. Parkinson","Okay, David, this is Bob Parkinson. So on cyclophosphamide, just to maybe frame this for everybody, this is a product that has grown significantly. It's approaching an annualized sales rate of about $400 million by the end of this year and, as you might expect, a very high contribution margin. So the issue, obviously, is the prospects of generic competition and, candidly, as we sit here today, it's a question of if we get competition, if so, when, and if so, how many. And those are questions that we don't have specific answers to at this stage. I think it's reasonable to expect that there will be competition to this product, in all likelihood, in early 2014. So in terms of -- and I don't want to get into too much detail in terms of potential impact for next year, like I say, it's a function of if and if so, when and how many competitors. And if there's multiple competitors, as you all know, it's a very different scenario than if there's one, so we just have to see how that goes. But to kind of frame this maybe for everyone, and I know various analysts have taken a stab at quantifying this, we would estimate that if we have, let's say, 2 competitors in the market by midyear 2014, the bottom line impact could be anywhere from $150 million to $200 million. So potentially, it's a very -- that's a very big hit. But again, it's a function of those questions that I raised in terms of if, how many and timing. So on the Suprane one, that's a -- it's a little different issue, and I think even more speculative, it's likely there'll be generic competition in Suprane sometime in 2014. Not likely that there'll be multiple generic competitors, so it's a different scenario in that regard. It's also kind of a longer-term thing, I think, in terms of competitive progress in the accounts because of the issue with the vaporizers and the fact, as you know, we still have the full spectrum of inhalation agents that, in many markets, are on contract with hospitals, where we own the vaporizers that are installed and so on. And so, it's a very different set of dynamics. So the impact of generic Suprane next year, obviously, very, very modest compared to the numbers that I threw out on cyclophosphamide but not insignificant. I don't know that we quantified that or, at this stage, we even want to.","Robert J. Hombach","No, we haven't quantified, other than to say that it's $300 million in sales globally, about $200 million in the U.S. on a run rate basis. But again, I think the trajectory, as you pointed out, is going to be quite different...","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes.","Robert J. Hombach","Given the nature of the business.","Mary Kay Ladone","This is Mary Kay, but I'd also add, Suprane also has a high contribution margin as well.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And maybe just switching gears to the hemophilia franchise and more specifically, ADVATE, as you obviously called out in the script, it's getting increased focus as we approach the potential for a Biogen launch next year. But maybe you could sort of help us understand what has been the positive impact of some of your additional indications of -- I know you've had the adult prophylaxis in the U.S. for a little over a year now. Obviously, you got an additional indication in Europe. Maybe just talk to us about -- remind us your view on competitive positioning and any steps that you're proactively taking to help build the moat around the FA franchise.","Robert L. Parkinson","Okay, David, I'm going to turn it over -- Ludwig Hantson, as Mary Kay mentioned at the outset, is with us, and he's obviously closer to this. So, Ludwig, I guess, 2 pieces, which is impact in the market of our expanded label in the product and, clearly, we continue to have good momentum with the brand. And then secondarily, as we anticipate generic competition next year, a number that mentions supply [ph]. So I'll turn it over to you.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Thanks for the question. So the launch of the prophy indication is going well. It's still ongoing. So since the beginning of 2012, we switched the 400 patients to ADVATE prophy, and we've been doing this in different waves. The first wave was the most important one, focusing on efficacy. We're striving for a bleed-free world. We do believe that that's key in the treatment of hemophilia. The second wave, which we started like 8 months later, was focusing on the 3-day PK dosing method and the launch of the 4,000 vial. And now we're working on the third wave, which should reinforce the second wave. The plan is to submit an ADVATE PK device before the year ends, and the device should enable the physician to personalize the dosing towards the factor -- the target factor level on the basis of 2 blood samples. So this should help us to further reinforce the PK dosing piece. With respect to what we're doing, so -- and let me bring the discussion up maybe 1 level. So last year, during the investors conference, we talked about guidance of 3% to 4% sales CAGR for the next 5 years. That has not changed. So we believe in ADVATE, we believe in our team, and we believe that achieving a bleed-free world is key. And with respect to what we've done, the U.S. team is getting ready for the challenge. This team has turned a declining market share into a share growth and has put the bleed-free world concept on the map. So I feel pretty confident about our LRP and our guidance that we gave for the next 5 years for the franchise.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe I'll just sneak in one more in here while you reference the LRP. One of the things you guys have talked about is an 8% to 10% earnings CAGR over the long-range plan period, lower at the front end and higher at the back end. Is that still a dynamic with which you're comfortable?","Robert L. Parkinson","I don't want to get into the specific numbers, David, at this point. And obviously, we don't redo our LRP every quarter or every 6 months. We do it annually. I would give maybe just some comments so to help maybe frame our outlook in response to your question. Obviously, franchises like hemophilia and renal, particularly in view of the recent Gambro acquisition, we do continue to focus on the 5-year outlook on kind of an ongoing basis. And just to reiterate Ludwig's point on the hemophilia franchise, 1 year on from our investor conference last year, our long-term outlook for our hemophilia franchise, broadly defined, is very comparable to what we shared with you last year, both in terms of size and rate of growth, as Ludwig commented. I mean, obviously, the -- there's downward pressure as a result of competition, which we anticipated in our rollout last year with -- which we shared with you. There'll continue to be pricing pressure on very expensive therapies. But on the other hand, this still is a largely underdeveloped market globally. We have an emerging pipeline that we're very excited about. The public-private partnership with Hemobras in Brazil, we're hopeful, is not the last one of that nature that we do. So we think the positives are greater than the negatives, which is why we continue to be positive and optimistic about the long-term growth of this franchise. As it relates to the Renal franchise, likewise there. I mean, this is something we'll discuss with you quarterly in terms of Gambro now that we've closed the deal and we're integrating it both in terms of revenue growth and performance synergies. But the base Renal business outside of Gambro, specifically PD, has exhibited the most robust growth this year than it has in years. So our long-term outlook for the Renal business, both the base business and Gambro, and of course, last year when we had the investor conference, we had not closed the Gambro deal, but the base case renal outlook for the next 5 years also continues to be very positive. So as it relates to the rest of the businesses, without getting into too much detail, I think there are some things that have changed both negatively and positively from a year ago. I think admittedly, austerity measures around the world that affect pricing are more pronounced across all of our businesses than we would have anticipated a year ago. I mean, this year, we've continued to experience negative impact of FX headwinds, particularly in emerging developing markets. I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know how that's going to change over the next 5 years, but that's been a significant headwind this year. And I also think, generally, there's been lower growth in acute care hospital settings, certainly in developed markets, and we've all seen the impact of that right here at home in the U.S. So those are some of what I'll call the downward drivers, if you will, from our outlook of our long-term business a year ago. On the other hand, we know pension expense, which has been a drag, is starting to work in our favor. How much and for how long, I think also, like exchange rates, is difficult to speculate on, but that should be a positive versus our outlook last year. Also I think in terms of business development, there continue to be many additional opportunities. Just activities during the last year that were consummated subsequent to our investor conference, obviously, most notably, Gambro, but in licensing deals like rigosertib, which we're excited about, the recent collaboration with etanercept to continue to build on our biosimilar portfolio, these were all things that were contemplated in the last year's LRP. And we fully anticipate that the momentum we've built in business development is going to continue. So that represents a significant upside from the base case LRP that we shared with you last year. Another driver that's a positive, I think, is the opportunity to favorably impact our tax rate going forward as a result of the -- how we structured the Gambro acquisition. So that's just a few highlights, both downward pressure and upward pressure, but in terms of 2 core and critical franchises, hemophilia and our renal franchise, not any fundamental change as we look out over the next number of years from what we messaged to you last year. I'll stop there. It's easy to get into a lot of detail, but hopefully, that provides just a little bit of color, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just maybe a few quick questions here. Ludwig, just first on HyQ filing, it's in the script, but it wasn't specific. Can you just give us an update on where we stand on HyQ filing at the end of the year here? And have you received any additional questions from the agency post BioPharma's decision to end their hyaluronidase program?","Ludwig N. Hantson","So we're still on schedule to submit our file before the end of the year, David. We've not gotten any additional questions from the FDA. We expect that the regulatory path forward is well defined, and we expect a potential 6-months review. So that means that we are getting ready for a potential launch of HyQ in the U.S. second half of next year.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. Maybe 2 BioSciences questions, maybe, Ludwig, one for you, and then one for Bob Hombach. First off, IVIG supply. I think there's this view that your supply is increasing, but we're really not seeing it translate into the numbers here in 2013. So maybe talk just a little about where we stand on safety stock and sort of what can we think about in terms of the supply and growth perspective in IVIG over the next several quarters. And maybe for Bob Hombach, on albumin, just a clarification there. It's been a very strong market. Is the delay on the contracting or it sounds like that, is that simply a tender that you have very good visibility on or is this in any way related to some of the pharma disruption that we've seen broadly across the universe here in the third quarter?","Ludwig N. Hantson","So I'll start with the IG piece, and as I mentioned before during the earnings call, 2013 is a transition year for IG franchise, and we are now in the position to support 6% to 8% demand growth for our IG business, and this is a result of recent capacity upgrades and expansions, which we will complete in the second quarter. As you have seen in the numbers, we do see strong demand growth in volume in the U.S., so we do see an uptick there, and we were going to continue to build it in the U.S. So that's how we're looking at this. International sales are lower than last year as a result of our strategy to exit select markets outside of the U.S. given our prior supply constraints. This is something that we will have to work on in the next quarters to get the international market back up to the levels similar to the U.S.","Robert J. Hombach","But fair to say, increasingly, we're more comfortable with our inventory levels. As you know, we experienced backorders periodically throughout the course of 2013. And as we look forward to the prospect, as Ludwig alluded to, of a second half 2014 U.S. HyQ launch, again, we're going to be thoughtful about what markets we look to reenter as we move forward here and continue with the controlled launch in Europe for HyQ as well, as we have reimbursement in one country and are looking to nail down reimbursements in several other countries before the end of this year.","Robert L. Parkinson","Talk about albumin now?","Robert J. Hombach","And yes, as it relates to albumin, David, so as you may be aware, all biologic products exported to China have to have the license renewed every 5 years, and it just so happens that 2 of Baxter's products in the albumin space have renewals coming due here in the fourth quarter. Given the significant growth in demand in China and some other things going on, the regulatory requirements and approval processes have evolved, and those have resulted in the potential for delays in renewal of our licenses. And so we're continuing to work with the Chinese authorities, and we do expect to get the licenses approved or I should say renewed by the end of this year. However, likely -- highly likely that's going to impact the timing of some shipments, and so we reflected that timing delay in our guidance here for the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Keusch from Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bob Parkinson, could you talk to us a little bit, now that you've closed the Gambro acquisition, what some of the milestones we should be looking for in terms of integration? And then also remind us, since the deal did close a bit later than anticipated, how you're thinking about the dilution for 2014, which I think you had -- you've, obviously, previously guided to.","Robert L. Parkinson","All right. Larry, it's Bob Parkinson. Let me make some comments. And then in terms of dilution and some of the financial specifics, I'll turn it over to Bob Hombach. So in terms of milestones that we ought to be looking for, I mean, obviously, there's -- I think there's 2 critical ones, which is as we complete the integration and we move forward, obviously, the pace of growth -- one of the questions when we did the acquisition, of course, was the relative flattish nature of the business in the last couple years, while it was in private equity ownership, compared to our -- the prospects that we saw in terms of being able to grow the -- not only the core business but the acute business and so on. So rate of growth is an obvious milestone that all of us should be looking at. And the second one, of course, is the synergies. A big piece of the financial justification for this was contingent upon meaningful synergies, about $300 million of synergies, and so that -- so those are the 2 milestones. I think it's -- given the fact that we just completed the integration over the early stages, it's premature to take a specific position on either of those this morning, but those are the 2 things that I'm going to be monitoring, Larry, internally. So I think you all should be, too, as well. So, Bob, do you want to handle the other thing?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, as it relates to dilution, no change in our outlook, but let me just kind of reframe how we position this and then talk a little bit about some of the variables that may be additive or further dilution here related to our outlook. So we previously said for 2014 that, including amortization expense, that we would be neutral to modestly accretive in 2014. And assuming about $0.20 of amortization, if we were to back out the amortization, it would be $0.20 to $0.25 accretive. And so as we look forward here and as we approach guidance in January, some of the variables we're going to be looking at that could again impact that outlook, one is we closed the transaction a little later than we expected, as we had hoped to -- originally in the middle of the year to close the transaction, and then it ended up being a bit later due to the regulatory process. So the timing of synergy achievement in the very near term will be a little bit challenged. I don't think anything significant, but it will be a little bit challenged. On the plus side, I think whether it's the financing costs coming in a bit lower than we expected and some of the opportunities that we may have on the tax front that we've talked about, those are opportunities, I think, to potentially offset any leakage we might have from a timing perspective and maybe do a little bit better. But there are a number of variables, particularly on the tax front, that we still need to work through now that we actually own the company and look at some of the tax attributes about -- around loss carryforwards and deductibility of interest in certain markets and so on, but we do think there's opportunity there but not ready to quantify that at the moment. And so -- but I guess the last thing I would mention because this has come up a number of times, as we think about intangible amortization related both to our existing business, as well as now the significant increase we're likely to see with Gambro, as we've mentioned, this is something we've been thinking about, and I think the appropriate time to implement that would be in January, when we provide guidance for 2014. But given the significant impact that that's going to have, and just to reframe that for everyone, today, within our core business, we incur about $100 million a year in intangible amortization related to prior business development activities, which equates to about $0.15 a share. As I just mentioned, we assume that Gambro could be approximately $0.20 of incremental intangible amortization. And so at $0.30 to $0.35 of impact on an annual basis, that actually has about 150-basis-point impact on our gross margin as a non-cash item. And so I would characterize it as very likely that we will move towards excluding intangible amortization from our adjusted earnings projections, but we'll -- given the time frame that it's going to take us several months here to get to a reasonably final number about what the Gambro intangible amortization is actually going to be, because that is done through an independent third-party valuation that's ongoing as we speak, we'll be in a better position in January, I think, to fully quantify it for everyone and make the final call here about making the change on reporting going forward.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That was really helpful. And then just the other question is, Bob, in the context of, again, concerns around the competition from Biogen in the Factor VIII market, I'm just hoping you could give us a bit of an update on Brazil again. You made some mention of it in the prepared remarks, but how much -- can you quantify sort of how much you're beginning to ship there? And are there efforts that you can take to, perhaps, accelerate that $200 million in peak sales in 2017? And I guess, are there opportunities for, now that this relationship has been established, other products that could also go into the Brazilian market?","Robert L. Parkinson","All right. Well, maybe all of us could comment on pieces of that. Larry, this is Bob Parkinson. So first of all, we're very pleased with how the collaboration with Hemobras in Brazil is evolving. As you might guess, any time you have arrangements like this with governments, they can be a little untidy, and they all take their own shape and form, but we've navigated through a lot of that and continue to be very -- so the long-term outlook of $200 million continues to be a very realistic opportunity, but to say it's going to be greater than that, I'm not prepared to do that at this point, and we'll evolve to that over time. But just to date, I think about 10% of all the patients being treated in Brazil have moved from plasma-derived Factor VIII to our recombinant product, so I think that's an interesting metric or indicating the pace, and we anticipate that that's going to continue to move very quickly. I do think that -- and one of the reasons I called this out at the investor conference last year as 1 of our 4 growth vectors, public-private partnerships, we continue to be very enthusiastic about this. There's no doubt that as a result of this collaboration with Hemobras in Brazil, we've developed a broader -- and, I think, a relationship built on trust and so on with the Health Ministry and the broader government in Brazil, which we believe can lead to other opportunities over time. And certainly, with the -- even with Hemobras on the hemophilia collaboration, that's just on one product. That's really on recombinant Factor VIII. So as we continue to grow our hemophilia pipeline, we certainly would anticipate that we would build on that platform. The last thing I would say is that we continue to have discussions with other governments around the world that can represent meaningful opportunities in this kind of fashion, which is why we called it out as a specific platform or vector of our growth outlook. So I don't know, I've covered a lot there. Ludwig, please go ahead, yes.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yes, so I just want to add something on the market itself to put things into perspective. So there are about 9,000 hemophilia A patients in Brazil. The diagnosis rate is 70%, and there's no prophy use, so one of the objectives for us is to move from plasma to recombinant, but in addition to that, to move patients from on-demand to prophy. And when you look at the IU per capita, it's about 2, which is about half of Russia and U.K. is around 8. I don't want to commit to a number higher than the $200 million that was quoted, but clearly, if we do our market development right and we work with the treating physicians, there's a lot of work that needs to be done. And as we do with all of our hemophilia products, we're going to strive for a bleed-free world, and Brazil is a long way from a bleed-free world.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And your 200 -- lastly, your $200 million is predicated on IU per capita of what?","Robert J. Hombach","We haven't specifically addressed that, Larry, but, again, I would say that we have modest assumptions around prophylaxis, which, by the way, is not only our objective but a stated objective of the Minister of Health in Brazil to expand prophylaxis. So -- but we haven't quoted a specific IU per capita, but it is relatively low, and there is tremendous opportunity to enhance that and improve outcomes for patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just I wanted to come back to your -- the confidence that you guys are expressing in the long-range plan relative to hemophilia, and I want to ask the question, is part of your confidence in that long-range plan a view that you really won't lose as much share as the recent surveys are suggesting? You guys gave some pretty specific guidance originally in terms of anticipated share loss, and I just want to make sure that I understand what you're saying here. And so specifically, are you more confident than the Street seems to be relative to share loss?","Robert L. Parkinson","Well, let me make some high-level comments, and then, Ludwig, maybe you can pick up specifically on the share loss thing. As I said before, we fully contemplated competitive launches when we stood up before you last fall, so no surprises. And despite recent surveys that have been done and so on, there's actually no new facts in the marketplace that have emerged in the last 6 to 9 months, either about competitive products, our own or otherwise. What there have been is perspective study that have been shared and so on. So I'm not going to get into dueling surveys and things like that, but we fully contemplate that we will lose market share to competitive entries, as we shared with you last year. But the longer-term view of this critical franchise for our company is driven by some of these higher-level dynamics that I mentioned before in terms of the underdeveloped global market. Ludwig just took you all through the tremendous opportunity that exists in Brazil, and Brazil's not unique, not to mention our own emerging pipeline with our own longer-acting product, the factor, the RIXUBIS that just got approved and is being launched, the development of our recombinant von Willebrand, our Factor VII, and so on. So that's the basis of our position relative to the long-term outlook. Now -- of this critical franchise. Now, the short-term impact of launches, surveys, our view and so on, like I say, no new facts, a; b, nobody knows, and that doesn't mean that we haven't been busy over the last 12 months, and we're going to continue to be very busy over the next approximately 6 months before the competitive launch. And so we'll see what happens, but obviously, we're very familiar with this franchise, we're very close to the treaters, the patients. And to do a survey, you ask one question that almost assumes that you have a homogenous market. It is a complex market with the composition of very different patient types, and so to answer a question in a survey and then conclude that it applies broadly, I think, can be a little bit misleading. But I'll stop there. Ludwig, if you want to add...","Ludwig N. Hantson","Sure. The -- with respect to your first question on the confidence in the LRP, we believe that the 3% to 4% sales CAGR that I mentioned, and we mentioned last year, is driven by 4 categories. First of all, we potentially have 4 new product launches in the next 2 years: so RIXUBIS is number one; OBI-1, hopefully, by the end of next year; and then we have BAX 855; and our recombinant von Willebrand. In addition to that, we have lifecycle management opportunity of existing products. So we have 5 of prophy, hopefully, by the end of this year, as well as BAXJECT III device for ADVATE sometime next year. As Bob was saying, the geographical expansion with Brazil as a great example, but in addition to that, we've launched ADVATE in China, and the first patients are being treated with ADVATE. And we also plan to launch in Russia next year. And we continue to see a healthy market growth of mid-single digits. So that's the reason why we do believe that we're confident in the numbers that we gave you for the LRP. With respect to the market share loss, our market research suggests that the penetration of an extended half-life product will somewhat be slowed down by clinical -- limited clinical experience, a restricted label, restricted geographies, brand loyalty, frequency of physician visits. And when you think about the competitive pressure that we will have from the extended half-life products, it will be primarily in the U.S. adult prophy market segment, which is about 20% of our global recombinant Factor VIII business. And in that specific segment, we know that about 50% of the patients on ADVATE prophy are on a dose regimen of every 3 days or longer already. So we do feel comfortable with the guidance that we gave you on the LRP for hemophilia, and we're looking forward to a lot of opportunities with our launches.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But just to push a little bit on that, I think you guys specifically said originally, as it relates to ADVATE competition, that you would lose about $100 million a year each year over the course of the long-range plan. You didn't quite say it that specifically. You said you'd lose a point of growth to both generic competition and ADVATE competition, but then you said 2\/3 of that would be ADVATE, and pretty simple math suggests that's about $100 million a year. So I just want to make sure that I've got my math right and that that's what you're confident in from a share perspective. Understanding that you got other offsets in terms of new products and market expansion, but specifically around the issue of what market share loss you're assuming in the LRP, I just want to confirm that you're still comfortable suggesting that it's roughly at that $100 million a year per year over the next -- over the 5-year range of the long-range plan.","Robert J. Hombach","So, Bob, the -- we gave a 5-year outlook and said it would have a competitive interest and have accumulatively a 100-basis-point impact on our CAGR, which, if you do the math, gets up to about $700 million of run rate impact by 2017. I wouldn't conclude -- and we did say that about 2\/3 of that related to Factor VIII competition, but I wouldn't assume that that's ratable over that time frame because the launches happen in different markets at different times. As Ludwig alluded to, the competition will start first in the U.S. We just got news yesterday that one of the competitors we thought was going to be in the U.S. next year isn't going to be in the U.S. next year. And so there's a number of variables here that are going to affect the timing of that. And so, I think in aggregate, you're in the ballpark, but the ratability is going to be a factor of a whole lot of things including, again, when geographic approvals are achieved by competitors in different markets around the world because, as you know, a little bit less than half our sales overall are in the U.S., which means a whole -- quite a bit of it is outside the U.S.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. Okay. I just wanted to make sure you weren't changing the guidance as it relates to share in the LRP.","Robert L. Parkinson","No.","Mary Kay Ladone","No, there's no change.","Robert J. Hombach","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up to that. So, Ludwig, why is it do you think that a longer-acting product will just be used in the prophy population? There seems to be a lot of interest from the hematologists in using it on demand on a belief that the patients that come in on a bleed may not have to come back for days 2 or 3?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Okay, so let's -- as Bob started the discussion on patient types in the U.S., about what patient types are, maybe I'd like to go a little bit deeper with respect to patient types. It's not going to be a one size fits all, so every patient is going to be different. And at the end of the day, the decision will be taken by the physician or the patients on an individual basis. So patient segmentation is essential. But let me give you some examples of patient types that might be reluctant to switch. First of all, patients with a 0 bleed rate. Those patients, they control their disease very well and will ask that question, should I really switch? I think that will be a natural question. The second type would be there's about 1\/3 of the patients that developed an inhibitor early in their life. Those patients were able to overcome the complexity of an inhibitor through an ITI treatment. I'm sure that those patients will ask themselves the question of, in view of what happens, am I going to switch? ADVATE prophy patients, and we estimate that 50% of the ADVATE prophy patients are on an every-3-day-or-longer dose regimen, as I mentioned before. And then you have active patients, and those active patients -- this is not only for hemophilia A but also for hemophilia B, and it applies for RIXUBIS as well. Those patients, they live on the peak. So every time they have an activity, and this could be a daily activity, they infuse themselves right before the activity. You can ask yourself the question, would those patients go for a short-acting versus an extended half-life product? I think the other segment is pediatric patients. So it comes back to the discussion that Bob started that, at the end of the day, it's not going to be a one size fits all, and we can segment as much as we want, but every patient will have its own life story and will have a reason either to switch, and some of those patients will be switching, we know that. And as we said, we will lose some market share, but a lot of those patients will ask the question, should I really switch?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to go back on just the Medical side -- Products side, with the Fluid Systems sales. I know you gave a little bit of context in the prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you could just dive in a little bit deeper just to help gauge kind of how to think about that business going forward. And then any update you might have on the infusion pumps side with respect to the warning letter?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I'll jump to the infusion pumps first. No update. We'll continue to look to file by the end of this year and hope to be back in the market in 2014 with our spectrum pump again. This is a 510(k) update, and so, again, hope to -- expect to be back in the market, but no change in time frame there. As it relates to the rest of Fluid Systems, clearly, the key driver here, from a growth perspective, was the cyclophosphamide. And from a sequential standpoint, second quarter to third quarter, some timing and price driving that. Other than that, we continue to see strong demand for IVs, particularly in the U.S. and given some of the other issues that are prevailing in the marketplace, but nothing else, I think, notable within the Fluid Systems segment here going forward.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","How do you guys reconcile just the strong demand for IV in the U.S. relative to more the macro comments on pressure with kind of acute hospital stays and admission trends?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, again, I think the competitive environment, there's some issues that one of our competitors had has provided us some opportunity there. So I don't think it's a market comment, it's more of a share comment.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just turning back to the antibiotic therapies business, what gives you the confidence in modeling out 6% to 8% unit growth for plasma? Do you have any concerns just from a reimbursement standpoint, and some of the use is more off-label, albeit evidence-based? And historically, I remember you guys had thrown out some estimates that you felt that the end market growth rate, from a unit perspective, was more about 5%. So, I guess, how do you get comfortable that it really is 6% to 8%, especially given all the capacity additions that you do have coming online?","Robert J. Hombach","So a couple of things, and then, Ludwig, if you want to jump in as well. Our long-term view has not changed, and the 6% to 8% primarily relates to immunoglobulins, from a unit perspective. And really, that, going back 15 years, is a pretty consistent trend we've seen. And in fact, the last several years, it's accelerated for some of the reasons we've previously talked about, including more utilization in the neurological space, where twice as much product is used on a per-patient basis, as well as the growth in SubQ treatments, which, again, use more product, at least the existing ones, on a per-patient basis. Of course, that's one of the benefits we think HyQ will bring to the marketplace. But in any case, demand has been robust, particularly in the U.S. And outside the U.S., we continue to see under-penetrated and under-developed markets that have great opportunities over the long term. So as we continue to expand indications and find additional uses for the product and have the geographic expansion opportunities in front of us, that's really the main source of the 6% to 8%. But, Ludwig, if you want to add anything there specific, but, again, and I think for us, we're confident we're going to be able to support, as Ludwig alluded to, the 6% to 8% unit volume here in the coming years, given the expansions we've already done and with the prospect of a HyQ launch in the U.S. in the back half of next year, again, just further adds to our confidence in the ongoing demand for this product.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then lastly, just on BAX 855 just in terms of time lines, has anything changed or do you still feel confident in the ability to have that product approved in the U.S. in 2015?","Robert L. Parkinson","Go ahead, Ludwig.","Ludwig N. Hantson","So, yes, let me take a step back so that everybody is clear. So 855 is an extended half-life ADVATE. So it's a molecule that's proven, and it's the gold standard in hemophilia A. So our recruit -- with your respect to your question, our recruitment is on schedule, and we still plan to file before the end of 2014. So no -- and so far, no inhibitors have been reported, so we're still gearing up for a 2015 potential launch.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you said file before the end of 2014?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Correct.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a follow-up, first off, on, Ludwig's -- your comments on hemophilia and the potential pushback to switching to long-acting. Just on your comment about 50% of your ADVATE prophy patients already being on sort of a 3-day-or-longer regimen, as a layperson just thinking about that, wouldn't those also be the patients who would then have the best potential to get to a once-per-week regimen with the long-acting? So am I thinking about that wrong or why -- we would almost see sort of -- perhaps, opposite of maybe what you're saying that these patients might be the ones who might actually more want to switch to long-acting.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yes, so the numbers that you quoted are correct, so that's what I mentioned. So I think the preference of the ADVATE prophy patients are 3 days or longer, and we have seen this both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. It comes down to what I said before, it's going to be on an individual basis. So if those patients are well controlled, if those patients have 0 bleeds, then they will be people who are going to ask themselves the question, am I going to switch to something that potentially, since there's no registration yet, could have a longer dosing regimen? So I think it's going to happen on an individual basis. And then maybe come back to the question that was asked on what about the on-demand patients? You'll see that a lot of the on-demand patients for hemophilia B, for instance, 90% of those on-demand patients are mild to moderate. And we can ask ourselves the question are those patients going to be the ones that are going to think about a longer-acting product for hemophilia A? This is about half of the patients. So it's a -- again, it's going to happen on a patient-by-patient basis. But I think as ADVATE is proven, since we have 10 years clinical experience, it has shown strong prophy data. And as we said, we strive for a bleed-free world. We believe that 0 bleeds is the way to go, and that should be the focus of treatment.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And on BAX 855, I mean, I think that's really key to the sustainability of your recombinant factor VIII franchise moving forward. Have you had discussions already with the FDA around whether they might have any additional requirements for approval given that this is a chronic -- this is a product with a PEGylation formulation that will be taken chronically in patients. What's your confidence or what sort of discussions have you had with the FDA around whether or not that might require some additional regulatory requirements under a prior -- or how comfortable is the FDA with the PEGylation formulation?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yes, so the -- yes, we do have dialogues with the FDA on 855, as you can imagine. With respect to the PEGylation technology, this is nothing new. This is more than 3 decades old. So in more than 10 products with the similar technology have been approved. And when you look at the PEG concentration in 855, it is significantly lower than some approved products, products that are indicated for chronic therapy. So we feel comfortable that the work that we're doing should satisfy the regulatory bodies. Of course, as part of our market developments, we will ensure that the hemophilia community is familiar with the PEGylation technology, and that's clearly a work in progress for us.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And if I could just slip one quick one in, could you give us an update on how you're seeing the HyQ launch go in Germany, what you're seeing on pricing there, and kind of just give us early indications on the controlled launch there?","Robert L. Parkinson","A little early. We just launched in Germany and a couple of the Northern markets, so it's a little early, I think, to -- it's actually too early to comment on that. I think that's -- we'll update you the next time we get together on the call, we'll have a better frame of reference on that, Derrick, frankly.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, I'd say your characterization is right, though. We're being very thoughtful about how we launch this. It is a change in treatment regimen, and making sure patients and treaters are well educated, and it gets off to a very good start. We started in Germany, and we expect to get reimbursement in several other countries here in the coming months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International.

[Operation Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International. Jay Saccaro, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Bohaboy, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. On the call this morning we will be discussing Baxter's Third Quarter Financial results and outlook for the remainder of 2015 before taking your questions.","Before we review our financial performance in the quarter, I'd like to mention that this morning we issued an 8-K detailing the 2014 and 2015 quarterly income statements for Baxter on a stand-alone non-GAAP basis. Today's review of the results for the third quarter of 2015 and outlook for the remainder of the year will reflect comparisons to the 2014 ongoing baseline detailed in the 8-K filing.","With that let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments, and regulatory matters, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition on today's call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson. Bob?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Clare. Good morning and thanks to all of you joining us. We're very pleased to report strong performance for the third quarter, our first as a stand-alone leading medical products company. These results clearly demonstrate the momentum our organization has established following the spin-off of Baxalta, momentum upon which we will build to further accelerate profitable growth in the quarters and the years ahead.","As you saw in our press release this morning for the third quarter, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.41 per diluted share, significantly exceeding our guidance of $0.29 to $0.31 per diluted share. On a constant currency basis worldwide sales increased 2% and also exceeded our guidance. After adjusting for foreign exchange and the impact of increased U.S. competition for cyclophosphamide, sales advanced 3%. Results in the quarter benefited from a favorable product mix, lower operating expenses, and other income resulting from foreign exchange related gains.","As you know at our \u2013 excuse me \u2013 at our May Investor Conference we outlined a number of initiatives focused on expanding margins and accelerating profitable growth. These measures are gaining traction, as evidenced by our strong third quarter performance. While these are still early days, the initial results reinforce our confidence that we're clearly on the right path to achieve our financial objectives, which will create value for our shareholders, patients, employees, and other stakeholders. And as we've repeatedly stated our aspiration remains to exceed the profitability targets that we had laid out at that Investor Conference.","As you'll recall we're executing a three-pronged strategy to accelerate profitable growth, focused on rebasing our cost structure, optimizing our existing products and services through rigorous portfolio management, and finally, expanding our offering of high valued differentiated products through execution of our robust new product pipeline. I want to share a few highlights from the quarter in each of these areas to demonstrate the substantive progress that we're making on this journey.","So let me start with cost structure. Back in May we acknowledged the compelling need to rebase our structural cost to better align our expense base with the resource requirements of our new stand-alone enterprise. During the quarter we took an important step in this regard, initiating a global workforce reduction program, representing approximately 5% of all non-manufacturing payroll. This action is expected to generate approximately $130 million in annual savings once complete and is one of the first that we've taken to address our cost structure. As we move forward, we'll continue to evaluate our support levels to ensure that they're appropriate.","In addition post separation we've implemented an array of expense controls targeting discretionary spending categories that will reduce our ongoing spend moving forward. Collectively, these actions will ensure that we enter 2016 with a leaner cost base that supports our new business profile and financial goals. And I can assure you that our aggressive focus in this area will continue in the months to come, as we pursue additional opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce structural cost.","The second area that we emphasized in May was successfully managing and optimizing our existing product portfolio to improve operating performance. And as we've previously mentioned, we're taking a very disciplined approach with respect to our top line growth opportunities to ensure that they're aligned with our margin improvement objectives and deliver appropriate returns.","This year there have been certain international tenders that we have opted not to pursue, because they would not deliver benefits aligned with our profit improvement goals. More broadly we're applying this same discipline to each the product areas and geographies we serve. And we'll evaluate our presence in select markets to ensure it's aligned with our targeted return profile. And going forward you can expect regular updates on the progress being made in this important area.","We know emerging market performance has been the key topic of discussion for investors. These geographies play an important role in our growth strategy. And while we're certainly not immune to the macro challenges in play, we're confident that the medically essential nature of our products, combined with the breadth of our portfolio, will continue to position Baxter well over the long-term, despite some near-term volatility. During the quarter the company's emerging market sales rose mid-single digits on a constant currency basis, largely aligned with the long-term guidance that we provided in May.","And finally, I want to highlight some key developments in our new product pipeline. Innovation has and will always remain a cornerstone of our success. And we're committed to a future of ongoing advances in areas of clear medical need. Looking out over the months and years ahead, we'll launch a number of highly advanced new products, make significant life-cycle improvements to existing offerings, and expand penetration of our current products into new geographies.","Some of our recent achievements include FDA clearance for AMIA, our new automated peritoneal dialysis system with SHARESOURCE, our two-way web-based remote connectivity platform for home parents. AMIA is the only system approved in the U.S. that incorporates innovative patient centric features, such as voice guidance, a touch screen control panel, and SHARESOURCE. SHARESOURCE provides physicians with the ability to remotely access their home patient's historical treatment data and deliver individual treatment settings. We're initiating the launch of AMIA with SHARESOURCE and anticipate having units in the market before year end.","Also the recently CE-marked HOMECHOICE CLARIA APD system is successfully launching in markets across Europe. CLARIA builds on the strength of our market leading HOMECHOICE cycler, now incorporating advanced technology and the benefits of the SHARESOURCE web-based remote connectivity, among other patient- and other provider-centric enhancements.","Moving to our Hospital Products business, we continue to successfully expand the launch of our next generation SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump across the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. Demand for the newly enhanced SPECTRUM technology remains strong and is trending better than our prelaunch expectations.","Also in the third quarter Hospital Products announced FDA approval of Cefazolin 2-gram injection in our proprietary GALAXY Container. Cefazolin has been on the FDA's drug shortage list and in a variety of presentations due to high demand. This is the first of nine molecules that Baxter is developing and expects to launch over the next several years. And we recently submitted the second molecule for a review with the FDA and expect to launch this molecule in early 2016.","As these highlights demonstrate we're making meaningful advances across our overall margin improvement framework, and this is only the start. So with that let me now turn over to Jay for a closer look at the third quarter performance and also outlook for the remainder of the year. And then prior to taking your questions I'd like to take a moment to make some closing comments. So, Jay, please.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings in the second quarter of $0.41 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share. Performance in the quarter benefited from the disciplined management of discretionary expenses, a favorable product mix, which included better than expected cyclophosphamide sales, and other income from foreign exchange related gains.","On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $2 million included net after tax special items totaling $223 million or $0.41 per diluted share, primarily for costs associated with the company's spinoff of Baxalta, business optimization initiatives, debt extinguishment, and intangible asset amortization.","Before I walk you through the P&L I wanted to take a moment to make some comments regarding our historical financial statements, which we detailed this morning in our 8-K filing. First, I want to start by acknowledging your patience with respect to these statements. Given the highly integrated nature of the BioScience and Medical Products businesses pre-spin, the preparation of the historical filings required significant time.","Second, I wanted to highlight that these statements have inherent complexities associated with them when comparing current results with those of prior periods. More specifically, for the most part prior periods do not reflect income we received from Baxalta related to transition service agreements and deferred country closings. In addition given the highly integrated nature of our businesses, we were not able to clearly isolate select expense categories between Baxalta and Baxter in the discontinued operations presentation.","And lastly, the historical P&Ls included payroll expenses for certain positions initially determined as backfills for employees that transitioned to Baxalta. Upon further evaluation post-spin, some of these roles have since been eliminated and will not be replaced. Investors should consider all of these factors when comparing Baxter's current results to historical periods.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015.","Starting with sales, worldwide revenues of approximately $2.5 billion declined 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 2%, which compares favorably to our guidance for the quarter of comparable sales to the prior year. Excluding the impact of both currency and increased competition for cyclophosphamide, Baxter's sales grew 3% globally. Sales in the U.S. declined 1% on a reported basis, and after adjusting for cyclophosphamide, U.S. sales advanced 3%. International sales on a constant currency basis increased 3% and declined 12% on a reported basis.","In terms of individual business performance, within Hospital Products, global sales of approximately $1.5 billion declined 7% and on a constant currency basis sales rose 2%. Adjusting for the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide and foreign exchange, Hospital Products sales increased 4%.","Within the Fluid Systems franchise, sales of $526 million declined 3% and on a constant currency basis sales advanced 5%. Performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in the infusion systems business, supported by the successful launch of our next generation SIGMA SPECTRUM pump as well as a favorable customer mix for U.S. IV solutions.","Sales in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions, or IPS franchise, totaled $590 million and declined 8%. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 1%. Excluding the cyclophosphamide impact, sales in the category increased 9%, driven by strength across the franchise, which includes our nutritional products, pharmacy injectables, and hospital pharmacy compounding services. IPS and performance in the quarter also benefited from a U.S. government order for the pharmacy injectable PROTOPAM.","During the third quarter, U.S. cyclophosphamide sales totaled $80 million as compared to our previous expectation of approximately $50 million. To date there remains one competitor in the U.S. market, but we continue to expect additional competition to enter, although the timing of these entrants remains uncertain.","Revenues in Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, were $322 million in the quarter and declined 5%. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 2%, driven by strong performance globally in the anesthesia business and growth of core surgical sealants and hemostasis products, including our market leading FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix. This performance was offset by lower sales of select non-core biosurgery products, including PERI-STRIPS, where prior year's sales benefited from a competitor being out of the market, who has since returned.","Finally, sales in the biopharma solutions and other category, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $106 million, and as expected declined 19% on a reported basis or 12% on a constant currency basis. As we have previously discussed, this decline is driven by a large customer choosing to self-manufacture products that were previously contract manufactured by Baxter. I'd also note that this category now reflects sales for products Baxter is manufacturing on behalf of Baxalta, which totaled approximately $14 million in the quarter.","Turning to the Renal business. global Renal sales totaled $943 million, reflecting a decline of 11% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales grew 1%. Performance in the quarter was driven by mid-single digit growth in our peritoneal dialysis business and high-single digit growth in the acute business. This growth was offset by lower sales in our chronic hemodialysis business, resulting from our previously discussed decisions to forgo certain lower margin sales opportunities, the implementation of select austerity measures in Western Europe, and a particularly competitive environment for dialyzers.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin in the quarter was 43.8% and compared favorably to our expectations, driven primarily by positive product mix in the quarter. SG&A totaled $670 million and decreased 15% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, SG&A declined 6%, reflecting the benefit of the initial actions we have taken to re-base our cost structure and reduce discretionary expenses, along with transition service income we received from Baxalta in the quarter.","Further actions to optimize our support structure needs are somewhat constrained in the short term by the transition service agreements we have in place with Baxalta. These agreements extend over the next 18 to 24 months. And as we pursue additional opportunities to streamline our ongoing functional support requirements, we must be mindful of the services we're providing to Baxalta.","R&D spending in the quarter of $140 million decreased 5% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis R&D expenditures increased 2%, as we have balanced increased investments to support our new product pipeline with efforts to optimize our overall R&D spend.","Operating margin in the quarter was 11.2%, which compared favorably to our guidance of 9% for the second half of 2015, driven by the positive gross margin and operating expense savings I just referenced. As Bob mentioned this quarter we implemented a global workforce reduction program, which will generate approximately $130 million in annual savings when fully implemented. This program is a component of our comprehensive strategy to improve profitability and significantly expand operating margins by 2020. As we move forward we'll continue to streamline our operations and control spending in support of this objective. All of our cost structure initiatives remain on track. And we are confident in our ability to achieve the 2020 operating margin target.","Interest expense was $34 million in the third quarter, compared to $31 million last year. During the quarter we successfully executed a tender for $2.7 billion of outstanding bonds. The benefit of this reduced debt level was more than offset by lower levels of capitalized interest in the quarter.","At quarter end our current gross outstanding debt balance was approximately $6.7 billion and consisted of approximately $4.8 billion of bonds and other term debt, approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding balances on our revolving bank line, and approximately $400 million of commercial paper. As previously communicated we'll look to further delever our balance sheet in the months ahead as part of our strategy to optimize the retained equity stake. In addition to these activities we expect our retained stake utilization plans to include equity for equity exchanges as well as a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan, subject to regulatory approval.","Cash on hand at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $2 billion. Other income totaled $39 million and included a planned gain related to the sale of select equity investments of approximately $20 million and an unplanned foreign exchange gain from hedges on balance sheet positions of approximately $20 million.","The tax rate was 20.8% for the quarter. And as previously mentioned adjusted earnings of $0.41 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.29 to $0.31.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our full year sales guidance and outlook for the fourth quarter.","Starting with sales on a constant currency basis. We now expect sales for the full year 2015 to increase approximately 1%. And after adjusting both periods for the cyclophosphamide impact, we continue to expect underlying growth of approximately 3%. This is driven by growth in the Hospital Products business of approximately 1%, or 4% excluding cyclophosphamide.","Specific to the franchises within Hospital Products we now expect sales growth of 4% to 5% for Fluid Systems, reflecting the strong performance from infusion systems and U.S. IV solutions. For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise we now expect sales to decline low single digits. As you know this category includes cyclophosphamide. For the full year 2015 we now estimate U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to total more than $250 million, reflecting the $30 million third quarter benefit and an additional benefit of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter, relative to previous guidance. Growth for the category after adjusting for cyclophosphamide is expected to increase mid-single digit.","With the Surgical Care franchise we anticipate sales to grow approximately 3%. This growth is somewhat slower than our original expectations and reflects lower sales of non-core biosurgery products.","And finally, for the Hospital Products business we now expect the other category, which includes our biopharma solutions franchise, to decline mid-single digits. As I mentioned earlier this category now includes sales related to contract manufacturing agreements we have in place with Baxalta.","For the Renal business we now expect full-year sales to increase approximately 1%, as we remain focused on maximizing the profitability of this business and maintaining a disciplined approach with respect to international tenders. In addition as a reminder, the Renal business is more exposed to the current volatility in emerging markets than other areas of our portfolio. While over the long term we feel very confident that we're well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within these geographies, near-term performance will be impacted by softness in these markets.","Moving to the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency to decline approximately 1%. And after adjusting for U.S. cyclophosphamide to increase 1% to 2%. At current foreign exchange rates we expect reported sales to decline approximately 9%. For the fourth quarter we expect an operating margin between 9.5% and 10%, which again compares favorably to our previously issued second half guidance of 9%.","The sequential decline from the third quarter reflects incremental operational improvements and additional savings from our cost reduction initiatives being more than offset from the impact of lower sales of higher margin products like cyclophosphamide and PROTOPAM, as well as the negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect interest expense to total approximately $35 million and other to be an expense item of approximately $5 million in the quarter. We continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 20% and an average share count of 550 million shares.","As stated in our press release we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. Relative to our previous guidance earnings in the quarter reflect the benefit of incremental sales for cyclophosphamide, offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.","Before we open up the call for Q&A I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob for some closing comments. Bob?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jay. So before we do open up for Q&A I'd like to spend just a minute addressing Baxter's path forward. Certainly, our biggest milestone in 2015 was the successful completion of the BioScience spinoff, resulting in the establishment of two leading global healthcare companies. The spinoff positioned both Baxter and Baxalta with improved focus and an ability to innovate and operate more effectively, which will create enhanced value for all of our stakeholders.","I would tell you I couldn't be more pleased with the progress the Baxter organization has made following the spinoff, and my confidence in our future has never been stronger. Our third quarter results I think demonstrate the commitment of all of our employees around the world and the clear alignment that exists throughout the organization on achieving our strategic, operational, and financial objectives.","Given this momentum which has been established I'd like to touch on the search process for a new Baxter Chief Executive. As I mentioned last quarter this is a front burner topic for the board. I would tell you we're making very good progress in the search for my successor. As I think you can understand due to the confidential nature of the search we can't comment now on timing or other specifics this morning.","Turning to capital allocation and in particular our use of the retained Baxalta equity stake, where our primary objective remains maximizing the after-tax value of the stake. Consistent with our previous statements we intend to use the stake in a highly tax efficient manner to optimize our capital structure, which will provide additional flexibility to support organic growth initiatives and pursue external business development opportunities.","Regarding M&A. While we did not include any benefit in the financial projections that we provided in May, going forward we expect M&A to be a key component of our strategy to accelerate profitable growth. Over the next 12 months as we enhance our balance sheet and progress on our post-spin margin improvement initiatives, we will have significant flexibility to evaluate opportunities that are more transformative in both scope and scale, but still align with our business model and leverage our broad channel strength and geographic presence.","In closing our aspiration remains to be a truly great company in service of our mission to save and sustain lives. And I'm confident that we're on our way to achieving this goal.","So with that I think we can now open up the call to questions, Clare. Okay?","Clare Trachtman - Director-Investor Relations","Stephanie, would you open?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and additional replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. And our first question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask one strategic question and one financial question. And maybe, Bob, I'll pick up on where you ended the call with respect to M&A. I think at the time of the Analyst Meeting back in May, the communication was that unlikely to see M&A for at least 12-plus months. And now it sounds like M&A is becoming a more important part of the potential forward path. And understandably it might not happen immediately. But can you maybe just sort of talk us through the evolution of the thought process around M&A? And give us some flavor for why M&A has become a \u2013 potentially moved up the priority scheme? And then what type of deals you might be considering?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think a lot of this, David, is about timing. At the May conference I commented on two constraints in the short term, certainly within let's say the first 12 months. One was some financial constraints certainly as we navigated our way through the retained stake and so on. But the second one being organizational. Completing the innovation of Gambro, our ability to continue to support the Baxalta spinoff, which requires a significant organizational commitment on Baxter's behalf going forward.","Relative to the organizational constraint, frankly things have moved ahead even better than we had anticipated I think on all fronts. So I think our organizational capacity to contemplate being more proactive, perhaps maybe even a little sooner on M&A, is better today than what maybe we had anticipated in May. And it's not going to be long before we've worked through this retained stake and so on. And as I commented in my prepared comments we're going to have significant flexibility. So we've advanced our thinking on things that we might want to do on the M&A front. I'm not going to be real specific in terms of size. But possibly we could be thinking bigger than maybe what we've characterized in the past.","What we do know is we have such a strong presence in the acute care hospital channel, wherever you go in the world. The Baxter brand is well recognized. It's respected. And so the opportunity to do some things that fill out that channel more effectively, we're very interested in. So beyond that I'm not going to be any more specific than that. But hopefully that gives you maybe a little bit more color as to how I think things evolved since we got together last May.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that's definitely helpful. Thank you for \u2013 and then just...","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the financial side obviously the second half of 2015 is coming in better than you had communicated, some of which is tied to a slower run down in cyclophosphamide than might have been previously expected. But how should we think about what we're seeing in the back half of 2015 as it relates to the initial targets you provided for 2016 back in May? How much of what we're seeing is sustainable versus more one time in nature?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jay, you want to handle that?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Just making a comment in terms of third quarter performance. We over-achieved the midpoint of our guidance by $0.11. And there was really three primary drivers which contributed to that. One was cyclophosphamide. A second item related to some other income driven by foreign exchange and the timing of investment gains. And then the third piece relates to savings related to the cancellation of (30:51) spending controls that we put in place as well. So those really are the three primary drivers of the over-achievement in Q3. As we move forward, what I would say, is the one that was most important to us was the operational performance related to the spending controls that we put in place.","And we're not updating 2016 guidance at this stage. But what I will tell you is we're very confident in our ability to execute, particularly on the cost side and also on the margin side as we move forward. We'll update guidance in January. But at this stage, I think this first quarter was a very important building block for us to put in place that gives us a high level of confidence as we move forward through the rest of the plan.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So you had good performance. You outlined the three factors. I guess could you expound a little bit on the third one that you talked about in terms of the savings cancellation? And I was just wondering if you could help us put that into context with your prior guidance. How much of the upside was driven by that? And then how much does that change your margin expectations maybe relative to the LRP? What wasn't in the guidance before?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the biggest factor was really the timing of the action. So as we think about the performance in Q3, we had approximately $25 million, maybe a little bit more than that, of savings related to two areas: discretionary spending controls that we put in place and then also the cancellation of open roles. And so as we had a high level of confidence that we were going to successfully execute the spin, and we started to see the performance work out well very early in the July timeframe, we were very proactive in terms of pulling forward some of the spending initiatives that we had earmarked for later in the year.","So some of the benefit that we saw in Q3 is not something that we would quote-unquote tack on to future periods, but rather something that benefits Q3 specifically. And because we were confident in our ability to execute, we were able to put those pieces in place earlier than we previously expected. So as far as the impact on the long-range plan, I wouldn't say that this is quote-unquote incremental at this stage, but rather it just gives us confidence that we're going to be able to execute as we move forward.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess another piece that you've talked a little bit about that wasn't in the plan numbers is an opportunity on price, maybe in the PD business or in the IV solutions business. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities in each of those two businesses, and I guess why you feel like pricing may be a lever that you can pull over the next 12 months?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now I don't, Matt, I don't think there's anything new there from what we've messaged previously on that. And so for a number of reasons, including competitive reasons, I don't think I'd want to expand on that any further this morning.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot for the comments.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Bob, go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. So I wanted to follow up with a couple questions on the operating margins. So I'll just rattle off a few things here. So in the quarter, how much of the roughly 200 basis points of operating margin beat was due to the $30 million in better cyclo sales? And in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, which looks like it's down by about 150 basis points, could you just break that out a little bit more? Because it seems like cyclo is only coming down by $5 million. So just want to understand the kind of Q3 to Q4 dynamic there a little bit in a little bit more detail.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Just one clarifying comment before I address the rest of the question. Cyclo is actually down from Q3 to Q4 sequentially $30 million, so in Q3 we achieved roughly $80 million. We expect to achieve roughly $50 million in Q4.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","As it relates to the operating margin of 11% in the quarter, there were really two drivers of that. One relates to the cyclo over-performance, and that was about 1 point. And the second relates to the timing of the spending savings that we were able to initiate. And that was another roughly 1 point of margin. So if you adjust for those two items, those were the two drivers of the over-performance.","Now turning sequentially from Q3 to Q4. We're guiding to 9.5% to 10%. And so relative to the 11.2% that we experienced in Q3, there are a number of drivers. First, we have about 1 point of cyclo deterioration from Q3 to Q4. Second, we have about 1 point of foreign exchange deterioration from Q3 to Q4. The other comment is in Q3 we had a large order of PROTOPAM. And while that's not necessarily a one-timer, it is a periodic order that we receive, and we don't forecast one for Q4. And that's roughly 0.7 points of margin that we're going to lose from Q3 to Q4 that we expected and planned for.","But as we think about our performance moving forward, there are two drivers that we're going to continue to experience benefits from, general operational improvements of about 80 basis points and operational OpEx savings will also continue to accelerate as well. So as we think about it, that's what drives the 11.2% to roughly 9.5% to 10%.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, Jay. That's very clear. Thank you. And then one big picture question regarding the request last night from a couple senators for the FTC to investigate saline business broadly among the big three competitors there. I'm sure there's probably not much you can say about that. But I just wanted to make sure I had a good understanding. In the current LRP, this business is a decent chunk of the overall whole. What kind of \u2013 I mean I assume you've been assuming pretty decent price increases in that business in your LRP. Could you just confirm what kind of price increases you've got assumed in the LRP for saline going forward?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Overall in the long-range plan we had fairly modest price increases across the portfolio. In some product categories we had low increases. In other product categories we actually had price declines. Bob, you want to add anything?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So thanks for asking the question, Bob. And again I'm somewhat limited in terms of what we can say. But maybe some thoughts I would share. I think everybody appreciates the fact that IV solutions are probably one of the best medical values in healthcare today. We've used the analogy of the cost of an IV as less than a cup of coffee or a bottle of water that you'd buy at 7-Eleven. Right?","I will tell you all we've made extraordinary efforts to maximize the availability of product to address the shortage, including significant investments to identify and secure additional sources of supply. By the way this includes working with the FDA to get one of our foreign plants in Spain approved to import product from Spain to help mitigate the shortage situation. We continue to work with them on other international sourcing locations as well.","The average price for IVs has increased at a fairly modest level over the past. Okay? And Jay commented on our views going forward. So I would just conclude by saying look, we're confident in our practices. I would characterize them as reasonable, appropriate. But again just to reiterate, we're taking every step we possibly can to make product available to address the shortage. So beyond that I won't expand any further, Bob. But thanks for asking the question.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Bob, just to start with you really quickly here. Emerging market commentary kind of across the coverage universe this quarter has varied amongst companies. I think you commented that your EM business was generally in line with what you talked about back in May. Can you sort of talk about how you saw the business in May? What you're seeing here in the third and early fourth quarter? And how you describe your EM business here from a growth perspective? Is it stable? Is it slowing? Is it accelerating?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So thanks for asking the question, David. Yeah, I characterized it as generally in line. Frankly, it's a tad softer than what we had messaged in May, although it's hanging in there pretty well and probably stronger than a lot of other companies. And I think that speaks to, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, the \"essential nature\" of our products and so on. But look, the reality is \u2013 and we all know what's going on \u2013 emerging markets are a real challenge right now. And I'm not going to project a significant turnaround in the near term.","But I do think the guidance that we provided over our LRP in terms of revenue growth will be achieved over the 5-year period of time. I would tell you the one business that has been particularly hit by that has been kind of the traditional in-center hemodialysis business, which we saw a disproportionate impact of the softening of the emerging markets. But just so you don't misinterpret my comments, emerging markets \u2013 continued investments in emerging markets given the nature of our products will continue to be an important aspect of our growth prospects over the LRP.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe just, maybe two quick ones. Bob, just one more strategic view.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You mentioned the word transformative in your M&A commentary. Is transformative M&A possible during the CEO transition? And then second one just for Jay. In Fluids Systems there's a lot of strength there. Jay, was that systems or disposables mix? What was the bigger driver? And specifically can you flush out what was it about the disposable mix that drove the acceleration? Thank you.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say in the first part, transformative is a relative term. But obviously we're open-minded to things that are material. I will tell you that I've had dialogue with our Board on some things that we might want to consider doing, relative to the timing of this as it relates to succession. I guess we need to define the succession timing first and then go from there. But the succession has not gotten in the way of us having strategic dialogue with our Board in this regard. And I'm confident that based on the timing of the succession that that dialogue will continue, David. Okay? Jay, you want to do the second one?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. And as it relates to the infusion system strength, really the key driver of that was the sale of the SIGMA SPECTRUM Pump in the U.S. We did see mid to high single-digit sales growth of access. But from an overall driver standpoint we're pleased with the progress that we're making on the infusion pump launch. That's going very well. And that was the key driver in the quarter that led to the double-digit growth.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. I just want to go back to maybe the first couple questions on the call. So just to flesh out the quarter. So, Jay, if you broke it down, the different upside drivers in the quarter between cyclo delay, the gains, FX, and other that were in the other income line PROTOPAM shipment this quarter, and then maybe the continuing ops, how would you break that down?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. The PROTOPAM piece was actually included in our original guidance. So that was not an upside to the guidance. But that was about $0.025 roughly of EPS that we had expected. The important thing about PROTOPAM is like I said in my comments earlier, it is not a one-time order. These are periodic orders that we receive. We just don't receive them every quarter. So it was an expected driver of performance in the quarter.","Relative to our $0.30 midpoint, as you said there were three upsides. One relates to cyclophosphamide. We had about roughly $30 million of unplanned upside in that category. One relates to other income. We had forecasted certain other income for the second half of the year, but we did over-achieve that, largely driven by balance sheet positions that we had in place in overseas entities driving foreign exchange gains. And that was about $0.03 of over-achievement.","And then finally, the OpEx savings that I described earlier was about $25 million, between $0.03 and $0.04 of impact in the quarter. And as I said that was a very important component for us to put in place early on this margin improvement journey.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So the \u2013 you would characterize it as $0.03 to $0.04 is what you would view as being ongoing?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Exactly. Those \u2013 that would be more ongoing.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then just to make sure we're thinking about the Baxalta stake correctly. Jay, is your priority still, besides the pension, the revolver that comes due in December?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, maybe just taking a step back. Thanks for the question, Mike. I'll make some further comments on the retained stake, so everyone is on the same page. The strategy with the retained stake remains the same. Our objective is to maximize the after tax value. We have a private letter ruling from the IRS, which supports essentially three mechanisms for us to utilize that stake over the next 18 months in order for us to achieve that tax free status that I described. One is an equity for equity exchange. One is an equity for debt exchange. And one is a contribution to our pension plan.","As it relates to progress that we're making in the quarter, we are continuing our discussions on the pension with Department of Labor. And we're very confident that we'll receive the appropriate approvals that will allow us to make a pension contribution. And we were pleased with the progress in the quarter.","As it relates to equity for debt, you're right. We did file \u2013 Baxalta on our behalf filed an S-1 in the quarter, which we have earmarked for a piece of debt that expires in December. The reason I like that debt is because it's a very low-cost way for us to use the retained stake in the sense that there are no premium or breakage fees associated with retiring that piece of debt. So it really does help achieve our objective.","To the extent that the market conditions are right, and we feel like we have a transaction window that's appropriate for us to take advantage of, we do expect to target that piece of debt with a portion of the Baxalta equity stake. More broadly we will think about equity for debt and looking at the overall bond complex in the form of a secondary offering with a modified debt tender later on.","So overall that all continues as we expect moving forward. And we do \u2013 we'll evaluate conditions as we move forward to see if there is an opportunity for us to target that piece of debt prior to December.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks, Jay. Thanks, Bob.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So one follow-up for Bob on your questions about M&A and strategic investment. Not to beat a dead horse, but I did just want to touch on one aspect of your meeting in May. It was talking about accelerating profitable growth. And so if we think of assets or transformative or mid-sized acquisitions or \u2013 and so on, should we be thinking about something that is a synergy play on your platform and with cost synergies involved? Or should we be thinking of something that is in fact going to help sort of drive growth your \u2013 as well?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Matt, I'm not sure I can expand a lot beyond what I said in answer to one of the earlier questions on this, but maybe to reiterate a point. The priority would be things that as I said before flesh out our acute care hospital channel. So that's another way of saying commercial synergy, where one plus one is greater than two. Clearly structural cost would be part of it as well. And targets that we would look at would be meaningfully accretive. But it would be both a commercial synergy play leveraged in the acute care channel, and depending upon on what the target may be, a structural cost as well.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","And one if I could follow-up on a question earlier on pumps.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","If you could talk a little bit about the success that you've had there? That process is of course winning contracts, placing channels, and enjoying and driving the pull through of utilization. Could you talk a little bit about maybe where you are this year? If there is a point where you've sort of either hit changing comps or change in mix? Or just some color on the process of that roll-out? And then I have one more follow-up for Jay.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So the momentum on the SIGMA launch as I commented is building. We're very pleased with the market response to date. Just to ground everyone you'll recall in our Investor Conference and the LRP projections, we assumed that we would regain approximately 5 of 10 share points in the U.S. launch lost over the last number of years, because of the colleague challenges and so on.","All I would say, Matt, on that is given the early impact of the relaunch, we are highly confident that we will be able to regain at least those 5 share points in the LRP. And I think our longer term aspiration of recovering all of that share loss, if not more, is certainly very, very viable.","Admittedly there's a little bit of pent-up demand. And so we want continue to gauge that and monitor the sustainability of that. But again all I can just really say qualitatively or subjectively is we're very, very pleased with the market response to SPECTRUM. The product is performing very well. And really beyond that I'm not going to expand. Hopefully that helps.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. Well congrats on the progress so far.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","And then, Jay, a comment. You mentioned a couple times the gains, FX gains, as being one of the positives. I was wondering if you could highlight \u2013 those sounded like balance sheet or asset-related gains below the operating line. Could you talk a little bit about the impact of the sort of FX gains that dropped through the P&L in terms of the offset, either natural hedges or otherwise? If you have a net feel for what the impact of FX was to the P&L?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So to your point the gains that I was pointing to are really other income related gains related to balance sheet positions held in overseas entities that are mark-to-market as part of our standard process on a monthly and quarterly basis.","As it relates to overall impact of FX, I did mention that sequentially from Q3 to Q4, excluding the area of sundry, we are seeing some deterioration in foreign exchange. So sequentially from Q3 to Q4 we have about $0.04 of impact that we expect to see. And that's about $0.01 to $0.02 worse than our expectations, driven by its deterioration in a number of currencies. We've seen a lot of volatility in emerging markets in particular.","From a hedging standpoint overall, for the developed market currencies we do have an approach where we look to hedge a portion of our exposure with the use of options. And then for those currencies that we don't, there are a lot of emerging market currencies today that we don't actually hedge in, because it's not economic to do so. In the case of those markets there are some natural hedges that we have in place. As you know we have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries around the world, or 40 manufacturing facilities in 25 countries around the world. And so as a result of that we do have some natural expense offsets to the sales that we have in place.","And that we don't have that many products that are truly global in nature, creating additional foreign exchange exposure. So we will continue to be exposed to foreign exchange. It's an area we watch very closely. We do see this $0.01 to $0.02 impact. But there are active hedging programs that we have in place. And there are some balance sheet programs we have in place. And then there are also the natural hedges that I just mentioned.","Matthew S. Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Larry.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Bob, I was wondering if you might take a stab at just giving us some thoughts around the environment in the U.S. and Europe. I know you already talked through emerging markets, but how about in some of the other geographies?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean ironically probably the U.S. market is as stable or strong as any geography in the world right now. You saw that with our performance in the first half of the year in the U.S., where we're seeing some recovery. We're seeing some expanded expenditure on capital goods, which helps our pump business. And we would project that that's going to continue. Europe clearly continues, developed Europe continues to be a challenge. We don't see any significant improvement there. I don't see any significant deterioration as well going forward.","And then emerging markets I think both Jay and I have commented on this morning. It's really kind of an unknown in the near term. Although clearly long term all of these countries are increasing the amount of spend to healthcare. And that particularly plays to our strength in terms of the essential nature of our product. So beyond that I realize that's all very qualitative. I don't know if there's anything, Larry, specifically within that you'd like me to comment on.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No. That's helpful. I just had two other questions for you. You did mention in the prepared comments about some competition in dialyzers. Again I recognize that's not necessarily new. But if you could sort of speak to that and weave in there sort of where we are on the dialyzer capacity expansion?","And then the other quick question for you was if I sort of just do the very high level math on the operating margin for the second half, it implies somewhere around 10.5% or so. You guys had been sort of focused on 11% for 2016. So how should we think about that 100 basis point improvement in 2016 from the initially targeted 9% in the second half of this year?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me comment on the dialyzer competition maybe a little bit more broadly on the Renal performance. And then, Jay, if you would pick up on the second part of the question. So first of all just kind of stepping back, we continue to believe the ESRD patient growth globally is growing around 5%. Our performance to date is impacted really by a number of factors.","First of all as I commented in the prepared comments, we've decided to forgo some lower margin tenders, which has impacted us in the short term. We continue to manage through conversion of distributors that Gambro had to going direct, which is the right thing to do strategically and long term, but in the short term can be somewhat disruptive.","And then of course I think a more competitive environment in the in-center chronic business than what we had anticipated. Although in fairness I would say in our modeling, we've always assumed some modest price erosion over the long-range plan for dialyzers.","In terms of expanded capacity, that won't come on until late 2016 in our investment in Opelika, Alabama. We also as I think you know are expanding capacity in the production of PD solutions in China and Southeast Asia and so on.","So the combination of the capacity expansion as well as an array of new product launches. AMIA, I talked about the approval in the U.S., which is very exciting. I mean that really builds on the HOMECHOICE, which is a $1.5 billion system globally today, so that's big. PrisMAX, the CLARIA launch in Europe, and then of course VIVIA for home HD.","So whether it's capacity expansion or new product flow, that's what's going to accelerate the Renal growth going forward. I'm confident that as we move into 2016 we're going to ramp up the year-to-year growth in the Renal business. But the reality is that the chronic in-center business, particularly in dialyzers, continues to be very competitive. We anticipated that, that perhaps to a greater degree than we had anticipated, but we're looking forward to the capacity expansion. So that's about as much color as I can provide there. Jay, you want to handle the other?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. On the operating margin, we did guide to 9% for the second half, and we're pleased that the second half is running better than that. As it relates to 2016, we actually guided to a 10% margin for 2016 and 11% in 2017, essentially 100 basis points of margin improvement per year. It's important to note that in 2016 we also expected about 100 basis points of deterioration due to cyclo. So in fact the organic or the true growth in margin in 2016 was really 200 basis points.","But like I said, our guidance for 2016 was 10%. Based on our performance in the second half thus far, we're pleased. And we have confidence in our ability to achieve the projections that we've shared. At this stage we're not making any changes to guidance moving forward. There's a lot of moving pieces, things like foreign exchange, pension, operational improvements, et cetera. And we're actually going through a budgeting process as we speak to firm up our 2016 expectations. You can expect to hear an update from us on our January earnings call.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","In the interest of time we'll take two more questions. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Hi, Bob. Just I wanted to follow up on the question on operating margins if I could. And maybe push you a little further. I mean just when companies I've noticed over the years start down this path of focusing more intently on cost reduction and efficiency, sometimes they can even surprise themselves. Maybe a couple things. The \u2013 for example the global work force reduction, how quickly will that $130 million savings hit the P&L?","And maybe, Jay, talk to us about the possibility of other discretionary spending cuts? I mean just remind us what some of the opportunities are. Is it in supply chain? Is it back office? Is it IT? Just help us understand the larger directional picture if you would.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me maybe comment, Rick \u2013 this is Bob \u2013 on kind of to set this up a little bit with some statistics. And then Jay can pick up the second part of your question. First of all in terms of timing the actions that we discussed this morning are going to largely be completed by the end of this year. So this is pretty immediate. As you gathered from our prepared comments this is the first part of what will be other actions that we will take over time. One thing we have to continue to be sensitive to, as Jay commented earlier, is the organizational support requirements for the Baxalta spinoff and so on. So we want to be cognizant of that as well. But we do think there are meaningful actions going forward.","And of course what we didn't comment on was the completion of the Gambro integration, which continues on track as well. So in aggregate fairly meaningful undertakings, the impact of which will be near term the \u2013 maybe to give you some specifics on the reduction, which we characterize as about 5% of non-manufacturing jobs. This translates into about 1,400 jobs globally, about 70%. Our existing head count, about a third of which are cancellation of open positions, roughly two-thirds of the reductions are outside the United States. And really spread around the world fairly evenly. So hopefully that's helpful. Jay, you want to pick up on the second part of the question?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And just to elaborate a little bit further. I mean overall we commented at our Investor Conference outlining 430 basis points of very specific cost improvements, 90 of which comes from Gambro, 80 of which comes from manufacturing, 50 of which comes from the pension, and 210 basis points related to G&A. And so by no means were we surprised by the size, scope, or scale of the restructuring that we announced. And so far everything is moving forward very much in line with our expectations from a cost standpoint.","One of the areas to your point that we're very focused on relates to discretionary spending. And we believe there is some opportunity to look hard at certain categories. We're using some zero-based techniques and looking at very detailed spend levels in areas like travel, consulting, and some other discretionary spending, like marketing and professional services.","And so as we go through our budget that's a clear area of focus for us. We think we have the opportunity pegged appropriately in terms of the impact on our long-range plan financials. But I can assure you with respect to all of these actions and the overall plan, the three components of the plan that Bob described earlier, we are looking to do better than we've outlined. And we're attempting to do that at each step. And so cost is squarely in that focus. But I wouldn't say we've been surprised by our performance at this stage.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Our last \u2013 our final question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Oh thank you very much for including me, and very nice quarter. In Renal did I understand that you're largely done with the Gambro integration?","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We still have work to do. I think we're approaching the conclusion of it. Jay, you want to comment?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure.","Robert L. Parkinson, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Specifically on the dollars.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well by the end of this year we expect to have achieved approximately $200 million in savings. And then in 2016 and 2017 we expect $100 million in incremental savings. Really the drivers of the remaining piece relates to certain manufacturing, a consolidation of activity, certain warehousing, and distribution consolidations. And then finally, there are some IT savings. As we roll out Baxter platforms across the Gambro network, there will be some G&A savings. And we still have a few IT implementations to go. Those are the primary drivers of the remaining $100 million in savings.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's very helpful. As a follow up as we think about 2016, can you remind us where FX may or may not impact different items on the income statement, other than obviously revenue? But how is it going to roll through, so that we don't get to 2016 guidance and suddenly have either other income or margins significantly different than expectations?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. As we look at FX in 2016, what we had assumed in May was essentially a constant FX environment in the sense that we assumed flat currencies over the long-range plan period. To the extent that there are departures from that, we'll first look to hedge using various techniques that we've discussed. There will be the benefit of natural hedges in place. But as we saw in Q4 based on the change in foreign exchange from Q3 \u2013 from June to today, let's just put it that way, we did see a negative impact of around $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter. So this will be one of the important assumptions that we update as part of our January guidance, along with many other items that we look forward to discussing with investors.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Robert L.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Candice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Chief Financial Officer.","On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter financial results and updated outlook for 2016 before taking your questions. I would just like to remind you during the Q&A session, if you could please limit yourself to one question so we can accommodate others in the queue.","With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Clare. This is our first earnings announcement since our May Investor Conference, and the strategies we outlined at the time are clearly gaining traction. We're making steady progress in our efforts to enhance our financial performance through our disciplined focus on portfolio and innovation management (sic) [portfolio management and innovation] (02:15), operation excellence and capital allocation.","As you've seen in our press release, Baxter delivered a strong top-line and bottom-line results in the second quarter, exceeding expectations. I will share a few comments on our progress and then turn it over to Jay, who will provide more details on the quarter and our updated financial outlook. After that, we will open the call for Q&A.","So let's get started. Baxter's worldwide sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% on a reported basis. Sales growth was driven by strong performance in the U.S. Fluid Systems, U.S. peritoneal dialysis and global acute care renal therapies. On the bottom-line, Baxter delivered adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, reflecting the benefit of better-than-expected sales growth, favorable product mix and the positive impact of our continuing business transformation efforts.","Now, I'll briefly walk you through the performance of our businesses and franchises where we speak to sales growth on a constant currency basis, excluding foreign exchange, to provide a clearer picture of underlying operational performance.","Global sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.6 billion, including 7%. Excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide sales, Hospital Products sales increased 13% in the U.S. and 9% globally. Now to break our Hospital Products at the franchise level. Sales in Fluid Systems were $586 million, up 15%. Growth continues to reflect the strong launch of the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion system in the U.S., where we continue to gain market share, plus favorable demand in pricing in the U.S. for IV solutions.","Moving to Integrated Pharmacy Solutions, or IPS, sales were $563 million, increasing 4%. Growth excluding cyclophosphamide was up 8% both in the U.S. and globally, driven by solid performance across nutritional products, pharmacy injectables and hospital pharmacy compounding services.","With Surgical Care, which includes our anesthesia and biosurgery products, sales totaled $347 million, up 5% year-over-year. We continue to view biosurgery as an attractive opportunity for growth through both innovation and geographic expansion. In the quarter, biosurgery sales increased mid-single digits globally. Sales continues to be impacted by lower sales of selected non-core biosurgery products, ACTIFUSE and PERI-STRIPS, which depressed growth in the quarter by approximately 2 percentage points.","As we discussed at our May Baxter Conference, we continue to focus on strengthening this portfolio through the introduction of new products and delivery devices, expanded indications and continued geographic expansion.","During the quarter, we expanded the launch of HEMOPATCH, our advanced surgical patch to Brazil, Mexico and New Zealand. HEMOPATCH provides surgeons in these markets a new ready-to-use option that has broad indications as an advanced surgical patch.","Our line of inhaled anesthetics continued to lead the market globally with second quarter sales up 7%, globally driven by double-digit growth internationally, where we continue to leverage our array of high-quality well-trusted anesthetics, as a platform for continued geographic expansion.","During the quarter, revenues in the biopharma services partnering business totaled $124 million, a decline of 5%, as expected. As previously mentioned, growth in the business has been impacted by customer electing to take manufacturing in-house.","Next, turning to our Renal business. Global Renal sales were $965 million, up 4%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. peritoneal dialysis business, where our highly innovative AMIA APD cycler featuring SHARESOURCE two-way online connectivity continues to build momentum in the marketplace. There are already more than 500 patients on AMIA in the U.S. to-date, which have provided well over 30,000 treatments taking advantage of our cloud-based platform for remote patient therapy management. In addition during the second quarter, AMIA with SHARESOURCE was also approved in Canada, representing a new frontier for growth.","Renal growth in the quarter also benefited from the strong growth in acute business driven by increased market adoption for continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT, as a treatment for acute kidney injuries. Performance in the quarter also benefited from the strong flu season and competitive supply issues. We're very excited about the opportunities for this business, which remains one of our fastest-growing areas, and an active area of focus moving forward.","Our leading PRISMAFLEX platform was recently approved in China, and we've initiated launch of our PrismaLung low-flow carbon dioxide removal device in France, Germany and Sweden. Growth in the in-center HD business declined in the quarter as we continued to take a targeted approach to how we manage this business, including being selective about what markets and tenders we need to participate, aimed to support our objective of improving profitability of this business.","Before concluding, I will share a quick leadership update. Over the past few weeks, several outstanding executives have joined Baxter's senior leadership team. These include: Giuseppe Accogli, the new appointed President of our Renal business; Stacey Eisen, our new Vice President of Corporate Communications; Scott Pleau, our new Vice President of Operations; and finally, Andy Kidd, our Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. Andy will lead Baxter's effort to accelerate activities in the area of strategy and business development to augment our growth aspirations.","The entire team, those you met in May and our most recent additions, share my passion for Baxter's mission and the sense of urgency to drive transformation to pursue a top quartile performance. I have the utmost confidence in them as individuals and as a highly unified team to deliver on the potential that lies ahead for the company and all of our stakeholders.","With that, I will pass it to Jay for more details on the financials and updated outlook for 2016. Then we will have time at the end for questions. Jay?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter results. It's another important building block as we look to achieve our long-term financial goals. Operationally, sales increased 6% in the quarter, and on a reported basis, sales grew 4%. Growth came in two points above our expectations, driven primarily by favorability in Fluid Systems, acute renal and anesthesia.","Walking through the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 43.8% also compared favorably to our expectations and was driven by a positive sales mix and improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio.","Adjusted SG&A totaled $663 million and decreased 11% on a reported basis. This represents a 440-basis point year-over-year improvement. The primary driver of the improvement was our ongoing focus on controlling expenses and the rebasing of our cost structure. SG&A also benefited from lower pension expenses and TSA income from Baxalta-Shire.","TSA income totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter, compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. TSA income from Shire will continue to decline as the need for these services ramps down. We expect TSA income in the second half of 2016 to be approximately $50 million compared to $65 million in the second half of 2015.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $150 million increased 1% versus the prior year. As we had previously announced, we discontinued our investment in the VIVIA home hemodialysis program in the second quarter, but plan to reinvest that spending into new programs in PD, biosurgery and other initiatives to fuel future growth.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.3% and compared favorably to our expectations driven by increased sales, positive product mix and continued discipline around expense management. This represents a 530-basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015.","Interest expense was $11 million in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of lower debt balances resulting from the utilization of the Baxalta retained stake to retire approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt. Interest expense in the quarter was also impacted by a one-time reclassification of capitalized interest from Other to interest.","During the second quarter, Baxter completed its disposition of the retained Baxalta equity through a contribution to its U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $700 million and an equity-for-equity exchange which reduced Baxter's outstanding share count by approximately 11 million.","Adjusted Other Income totaled $13 million in the quarter and included a foreign exchange gain on balance sheet positions of approximately $3 million and dividend income of approximately $7 million associated with our former Baxalta equity stake.","The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, and as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. Relative to the midpoint of our range, this favorability was driven by approximately $0.06 of operational strength and a $0.02 benefit from interest and other income. This was partially offset by approximately $0.01 due to slightly lower than expected cyclophosphamide sales in the quarter.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our outlook for 2016. Starting with sales, on a constant currency basis, we now expect 2016 full-year sales for Baxter to increase between 3% and 4%. And after adjusting for the U.S. cyclophosphamide impact, we expect underlying operational growth of 4% to 5%. On a reported basis, including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect sales to increase 1% to 2%.","We expect growth in the Hospital Products business of 3% to 4% or 5% to 6% excluding U.S. cyclophosphamide. Within the Hospital Products franchise, we now expect sales growth of low-double digits for Fluid Systems, driven by continued strength in the U.S. business.","For the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, we expect sales to decline low-single digits, including the impact of U.S. cyclophosphamide. We have adjusted our full-year sales forecast for cyclophosphamide and now expect full-year sales of $190 million with the assumption that additional competitors enter the market during the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for cyclophosphamide, sales are expected to increase 2% to 3% in IPS.","Within the Surgical Care franchise, we anticipate sales to grow 1% to 2%. And finally, for the Hospital Products business, we now expect BPS and other to decline low-single digits reflecting a change in our manufacturing service agreement with Shire. Selected products we had previously been manufacturing on their behalf will now be transitioned to self manufacture by Shire.","With the Renal business, we now expect full-year sales to increase 3% to 4% driven by continued growth in our PV and acute businesses, offset by lower sales in our in-center HD business.","Moving down the P&L, we now expect an operating margin of approximately 12%, a 100 basis points improvement versus our original guidance, reflecting increased sales and ongoing disciplined management of expenses.","We expect interest expense to total approximately $80 million. For 2016, we expect Other Income of approximately $40 million. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 20.5% to 21%. We expect the tax rate in the second half of the year to increase as the first half benefited from certain discrete items.","For the full year, we anticipate an average share count in the range of 545 million to 550 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2016 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1.69 to $1.74 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $1.59 to $1.67 per diluted share.","Finally for the year, we expect operating cash flow to exceed $1.4 billion and CapEx of approximately $900 million, resulting in more than $500 million in free cash flow.","Specific to the third quarter of 2016, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase 3% to 4%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to improve 2% to 3%. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.43 to $0.45 per diluted share.","With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.","And, our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we can.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, we can.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. So congratulations on a really strong second quarter. I'll limit myself to two questions. The first one for Joe, I was wondering since it's such a topic of consideration for investors, I was wondering if you could just give us an update on kind of the outlook for the balance sheet and M&A; what's the environment look like right now? Obviously you've been disciplined to date, but just curious if you could give us an updated outlook for, again, the balance sheet and M&A across the businesses? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, good morning. We don't comment specifically on targets as we want to make sure that that we'll get there first and don't get to pay too much for them. But we're very disciplined in that area. We've been looking at significant amount of opportunities. I just revealed yesterday we have probably more than 15 different opportunities in our pipeline. But I have to say that we also walked away from four deals in the last 90 days. They were too expensive. And we've got to make sure that we have the discipline to execute. We could execute those deals internally. We had absolutely the right teams to get them done, but the price was too high and somebody else was willing to pay more money for that asset. If we don't see a way there, we're not going to be competing on the price and innovation, prices of deals. They are now warranted.","I'd tell you, our focus is acute and we have \u2013 having Andy Kidd as part of my operating team also raise the profile of the M&A jobs in our company and we're working very hard to find those as we continue to progress in creating operational opportunities for the company as well as organic opportunities.","Our balance sheet is pristine at this moment in time, and so, one thing about M&A, it doesn't preclude us from buying shares back, and shares back doesn't preclude us from doing M&A. I think we need to have a balanced approach and we can do probably both of them if we do it correctly.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for that, Joe. And then, Jay, one question for you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the really strong top-line growth that you're generating. Can you give us a sense as to how much of that roughly is coming from price? Of the 6%, 7%, is that one point or two points from price this particular quarter? And then maybe a quick comment also on just how we should be thinking about the sustainability of Fluid Systems growth, especially in the U.S. Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Generally, you're right; it was a great quarter from a sales perspective if you look at businesses like the U.S. Fluid Systems, as you pointed out, and we saw north of 30% growth in the U.S. Just thinking about that business for a second, there is really two primary components to it.","One is the infusion systems business, and that's really driven by sales of the SPECTRUM pump, along with sales of the attendant sets. So once you install a pump, you have the sets that ride along with that. Our sets growth in the quarter was north of 20%, and then the infusion systems' overall growth was north of 30%.","And then, on the other side, we have the IV therapy business in this particular area, and that also grew north of 30%. In the case of IV therapy, it was a balanced mix of price and volume that drove the growth.","The other area where we saw some pricing in the portfolio is in the area of U.S. PD where we did see some opportunities to capture value. But beyond that, it's a fairly stable pricing environment. I wouldn't say that there are massive or very significant changes to price beyond those two areas that I referenced.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But is that one point to two points of the total 7% roughly the right way to think about it this quarter?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We don't really do price volume on the entire portfolio for a number of different reasons, but I think that the two areas where price was most pronounced would be in the PD arena and then also in the U.S. infusion systems business, in the Fluid Systems business.","The only thing I would add is we do see some pockets of price pressure in the portfolio, and so in some instances, there are offsets to price increases that we see. In certain markets, for example, where we see dialyzer pricing or other particular product areas, there are certain areas where we do see price pressures, so it is a balance. It's hard to answer the question across the board.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a really strong quarter. So maybe one high-level question on the guidance. When you look at the back half right, just given the one half performance, it seems to be a tad light in the back half, especially when you look at cyclo your assumption is now in a cyclo to impact in 4Q versus I think what we had originally thought as a 3Q impact. So can you maybe just walk through what changes one half versus back half as we think about the top-line?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. I think from the first half to the second half, there are a number of drivers of change. One is we do have a cyclo impact in particular in the fourth quarter we'll expect to see around $40 million of year-over-year decline related to cyclo on the sales line. As it relates to other areas in terms of sales growth, we are taking a very disciplined approach across the portfolio. So as we look at areas that don't earn the right economic return for us, we will very much walk away from particular tenders or businesses. And so in the fourth quarter of this year, there is probably another $30 million to $40 million of low-margin sales that we choose to forego.","And then the other comment I would make on the third quarter relates to PROTOPAM last year. We did have a PROTOPAM order in the third quarter of last year that makes a tough comparable. That was about $20 million. So if you adjust for those items, I think the sales is more explainable.","Overall, as we think about the guidance on EPS in the second half, if you were to go back to last quarter's earnings call, the implied second half guidance was $0.85 to $0.91 in earnings per share in the second half. As we think about today, our current view is $0.87 to $0.92. So essentially, we've raised the midpoint of the second half guidance by about $0.015 and which you have to realize is there're a couple of drags on the second half number. The tax rate is slightly higher than our expectations, in part because of profitability coming in higher tax jurisdictions, so that's about one point, and the share count is a little bit higher, I should say $0.01 and then the share count is a little bit higher as well in the second half of the year so that's about $0.01.","We do see a benefit of cyclo of about $0.01, but the ongoing organic base performance that we anticipate improving in the second half is about $0.03 relative to the last time we shared guidance. So overall, I think it's a story of continued momentum, but there are some factors that do slow second half relative to first half.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","That was helpful, Jay. And just maybe a follow-up on gross margins. You mentioned sales mix and pricing. As you sort of look at on a medium-term basis, right, if you look at the white space in general, a lot of your peers talk about anywhere from 50 bps to 200 bps of pricing headwinds. How should we think about pricing at the corporate level for Baxter on a medium-term basis? Should we think about a net neutral? And in the Q, gross margin, obviously the other part was mix, right? So as we roll forward the model how sustainable is some of those underlying strong gross margin trends we're seeing? Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I mean from an overall gross margin standpoint, clearly, we were pleased with the results in the quarter. And as we think about what drove margin in the second quarter and what drives it to the balance of the year, gross margin that is, there is the price, net price positive impact that we've seen in the quarter, so that's one element.","Now, importantly, we've signed many of our agreements, we've concluded many of the agreements in a variety of our businesses. So as we move to next year, we don't expect to see the same level of price or economic value captured that we've experienced but there are still some opportunities for pricing.","The other element in the second quarter that was, from my standpoint, very exciting was the area of mix. And so I commented earlier on 20% growth in sets. Sets carry a higher margin than the corporate average. We talked about the acute business which was just a star performer in the quarter. That too carries a higher margin than the corporate average. We also saw good growth coming out of anesthesia and nutrition. This idea of accelerating growth of our higher-margin products that's something that we expect to continue for the balance of this long-range planning period, and that will be one of the contributors that takes us to our aspiration of the 17% to 18% operating margin by 2020.","The last comment I would make is generally speaking, we saw very solid volumes in the first and second quarters and its accelerated sales growth does have a positive absorption impact on the entire manufacturing and distribution network, which allows us to benefit from higher margins by absorbing more costs. So it really was a confluence of events. We do expect to see continued margin improvements moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi Mike. You may be on mute.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Now we can.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Now we can.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Much better. Thanks, guys, and congratulations as well on a very nice quarter. So there is a couple of items I just want to follow up on. One, it looks like the cash flow guidance for the year has been relatively unchanged and started the year despite obviously very significant provisions to the EPS expectations. Jay can you just spend a minute on that? And then the second one, I just want to follow up on the price discussion thus far. Thanks.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great. From a cash flow standpoint, you'll see in the 10-Q when we report it. We're finalizing cash flow for the quarter with PwC working very closely. But we're pleased with the second quarter performance. What I would say as we look for the full year cash flow forecast is the probability of achieving our forecast has increased based on the two quarters that we have under our belt. I'm very pleased with the performance.","At the Investor Day, we talked about a number of important initiatives that we're embarking on. We just started a days payable project, and one of the comments I made at the Investor Day is the ratio between days payable and days receivable, days sales outstanding doesn't quite work for us. It's a real opportunity. And I will tell you, the early signs are that some of these projects are going very well.","But the reason that we haven't changed guidance on cash flow is a lot of our cash flow is back-end loaded due to normal seasonality patterns, and until I get a little bit better line of sight to how Q3 emerges and expectations on Q4, it is a bit premature to raise the cash flow guidance. But I will tell you that the probability of achievement has increased.","The other thing I will say is we have been really focused on CapEx, so this is an area where we believe that there is opportunity for us. The 9% of sales is something that we're striving very aggressively to improve. We have long-term plans to do so, but that's another area that as we move towards the end of the year that may be another area that we update. So on balance, I feel quite good about how the cash flow story is shaping up for our company. And frankly, from a free cash flow standpoint, this is a real opportunity for us, not only this year, but moving forward.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then on the pricing discussion, if I look across the portfolio, I was hoping you could maybe just provide some more insight into the contribution from price in different businesses. And obviously it's most pronounced in Fluid Systems, but the ability to take price in PD is something that's relatively new for the company.","The growth in the anesthesia business this quarter was particularly strong. Are you getting price there? If you could just help identify maybe the level of price you're getting in some of these businesses within Hospital Products? And where you're able to take price today that maybe you weren't 12 months ago? Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, we have contracts that are signed very recently in the last 12 months, they're three to five years, they have price clauses built into them. Okay? If we look at their trajectory area of growth like Fluid Systems going forward, we're going to continue to see growth in that business. Perhaps the rate is not the same as we took a significant amount of market share lately. But that is built into the contract, so I feel comfortable about that.","The point that you underscored by AMIA. Our PD business for many years has not experienced new technology, and we have this breakthrough technology with AMIA that really had stunned the market. We have significant amount of providers coming to us, and the price of the product is coherent with the technology and the benefit of things to our patients. So we've seen some really good momentum, and we see a lot of interest, not only from the providers, but from the payer side in this program, because of telemedicine and the innovative aspect of AMIA.","So we have slowed down the price erosion in dialyzers. So all-in-all, the company is looking at price neutral to slightly positive going forward versus any negative price pressure or erosion. So just, again, price neutral to positive going forward.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Joe, that comment is about your dialyzer business, or is that a broader comment?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, this is about the whole company. The whole company, I see the company when you look at all the price point analysis and what is built into contracts, the pressure in dialyzers, the EMEA launch and some of the new product launches we have, I would say Baxter will have price neutral to positive going forward, at least for the next foreseeable future.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And Joe that's a comment beyond 2016, right, because in 2016...","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...the price contribution is more meaningful?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is beyond 2016. As I said, some of these contracts are long into the future, so this goes into 2017, as well.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a question on the growth trends in the U.S. versus international. It seems like you had pretty meaningful outperformance in the U.S. this quarter, and I'm just wondering are you seeing something in the OUS markets that's changing? Is this just a one quarter phenomenon? I wonder if you could spend a little time on that?","And then secondly, just curious what you're seeing in the OUS markets between emerging market performance, Europe, et cetera? Thanks.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Overall, the U.S. did benefit from two very \u2013 well, two very significant product launches, more so on the SPECTRUM side than the AMIA side. But in the U.S., we are seeing the continued adoption of our SPECTRUM Version 8 pump, which is really a great innovation but also very exciting for, you know, from an overall financial standpoint.","And then the U.S. PD business also benefits from AMIA and also some of the execution that we're seeing overall in the U.S. PD business. And then finally, the acute business has seen outstanding growth in the U.S., in part benefiting from a flu season that extended and was a bit more acute than we previously expected. So there were a number of factors that set the conditions up for success in the U.S. that allowed us to overachieve our expectations and deliver the 10% growth.","Outside the U.S., we reported 3% growth internationally, and what I would say is emerging markets, roughly mid-single digits growth. We did have lower growth in China in the quarter, so low-single digits. In large part, you'll recall we exited certain tenders for PD where the margins weren't attractive to us. So there was that overhang on our overall business in emerging markets and in China. We do expect to sunset that after this quarter, so we'll see an acceleration we expect to see in emerging markets in the Q3, Q4 timeframe. So those would be a few of the overall comments I would make on that.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","That's helpful. And then on the biosurgery business, if I could. It looked like a nice step-up in performance there. I'm wondering is that just getting the portfolio straightened out? Is it underlying volumes? Any detail there would be helpful. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A couple of things. One was focus; make sure that we are on a global basis focusing on that business. We have great portfolio, and I think other things are taking precedence. The second thing was we have launched HEMOPATCH as well, and our efforts there is trying to ramp up. I have to tell you that we are in process of very \u2013 in final stages of hiring a President, a Global President for Biosurgery, which creates a vertical for this business on a global basis and it creates a very different focus in our company for biosurgery, which is a very different product than the rest of our portfolio and requires a significant amount of detailing into accounts. So that associated with us doubling the amount of R&D going into biosurgery is \u2013 and also two or three potential small adjacencies that can go into this business, it will revitalize our biosurgery business and put us on track to overperform.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Two quick questions for Joe or Jay. The first one is on U.S. Fluid Systems. So I'm looking at that performance here in the quarter, and it looks like about half the organic growth for the business is coming from just the U.S. Fluid Systems business, about 3.5%. So Jay can you sort of walk us through sort of anything you tell us on the mix of capital and consumables? And sort of how that contracting sort of falls forward into 2017 and what you think the structural growth rate for this business is on a longer-term basis? And I had a quick follow up on guidance.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, look, overall, Fluid Systems business we anticipate over the next five years to be a 3% to 4% grower, although when I look at this particular quarter and it's a very solid data point in terms of growth and adoption that we were pleased with. Thinking about the performance of the business, it's important to decompose it into a couple of different segments, right? One is the IV business and we are working very hard to bring additional volumes to the market. We're very focused on delivering. So as we think about the sustainability of this particular aspect, this should be a steady grower for the next several years, in part because of the contracts that we've discussed, but also in part because of continued volume that we look to bring to the U.S.","In the other roughly half of the business, the infusion systems area, there is two component pieces to this. The larger one today relates to pump sales, so we've had great success with pump business and we continue to perform in line with the expectations, or better than with the expectations that we've shared with investors over the last year on pump placements. But then, the other benefit is as we place pumps, going with those pumps is a non-capital sale and that's the set piece, right? So our sets were up as I said earlier north of 20% in the quarter, just a very solid element.","This becomes more of an annuity or an ongoing stream of business that's related to pumps, and so I would say that's a more sustainable business than the capital sales, which are a little bit lumpier in nature, if you will. Overall, though, we feel confident that the business will grow; I believe north of 10% on a full-year basis globally; and then moving forward for the next five years, this 3% to 4% kind of mid-single digit type growth is what we can expect to see from Fluid Systems.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, Jay, very, very, helpful. And then second is just to reconcile kind of the fourth quarter number. My way of thinking about it is, maybe you print a 2%, 2.5% constant currency for the fourth quarter, and then we sort of add back a point and a half from cyclo, and a point and a half from the discontinued operations you talked about. And that kind of gets you back to sort of 5%, 5.5%, which is sort of consistent with the first half. Is that sort of a decent way of thinking about the fourth quarter?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That's exactly how we look at it. So we had about a point and a half of cyclo. I wouldn't characterize it as discontinued operations, but for us we're going to be very disciplined about sales, we will forego sales in certain instances that don't make sense. That's about a point and a half of impact. In that case though, that's a very low-margin impact. As you know, the cyclo on the other hand is a higher-margin impact.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Great quarter.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. So one follow-up for you Jay on gross margin. So very strong in the quarter at least relative to our estimates. I'd love to get some additional, anything you can quantify around some of the puts and takes there, biased to a business line or product line. I mean, based on David's question, it looks like even though sets for example has started to pick up growth, you're not quite growing as fast as capital and infusion systems. So is that reflecting some of the strength here? Is cyclo some of the strength? Just maybe take through the business lines and can you talk a little bit about that, and then I have a follow-up for Joe.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Just from a gross margin for the quarter, actually cyclo was below our expectations by a little bit, and there were a variety of reasons, but it was not meaningful. But when you talk about missing cyclo sales relative to expectations by $5 million to $7 million that has an impact on both gross margin and EPS. So the margin that we saw was even in excess from a pure operational standpoint.","But, look, there are two primary factors, right? One is price. So we did see some price benefit in the quarter. But another, and again this is the more sort of exciting area as I look at the business, is a area of mix. So when you have our sets business, our acute business which is a $400 million business, our anesthesia business which is I believe north of $700 million, our nutrition business which is also a very healthy size business for us. When you have roughly 20% of your portfolio growing at a faster rate than the corporate average, and when that has a much higher average margin than the corporate average, it really is a benefit that you see on the gross margin line. In our case, that's something that we experienced in the second quarter.","Now, turning to the rest of the year, we do expect to see some of that continued benefit from the accelerated growth of those higher-margin businesses, but then there is also a secondary impact which I referenced earlier which is as your plants fill up with incremental volume, there is additional absorption that's occurred. The manufacturing network becomes more utilized, so you do see an attendant absorption benefit on the cost profile, which also impacts margin. So second quarter great; you see price and mix playing coming to bear. Moving forward, we'll have price, mix and volume. That's why we've been able to increase the guidance in the second half of the year.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And the follow-up for Joe, you had mentioned when we were out to see you just these initiatives of reinvigorating the entrepreneurial spirit of some of the teams across Baxter as one of the things you've been focusing on, and I'd love to get your perspective. If you could spend a few minutes just on the progress there, and just specifically on what we'll see from that? The types of benefits you hope and expect to see in terms of growth and margins, and when maybe we start to see some of that flow through?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have a pretty structured program. We have somebody in charge of that who reports directly to Paul Vibert, our President of International. Couple are notable. As we just launched a pain pump in Italy, in Europe, that was a local initiative. The Elastomeric business is active outside the U.S. and we didn't have the right product for parts of Europe. We just launched that, so good pickup in margin and sales for the group.","We also have a plan to bring China to $1 billion by 2021, which is now much shorter than that in our LRP. So that brings growth up to the \u2013 to close to 10%. So we're very excited about that. That was all done local, China for China; significant amount of change in direction and mix of products with parts of the business refocusing nutrition for China, which is a great opportunity and introducing biosurgery in China, which we don't have today.","So these are just two examples. I can give you a great example in Brazil and Colombia, where we're relaunching our Ringer product and \u2013 with big sales in three years of $15 million, they're highly profitable. So we have significant amount of programs going on in the company to sustain organic growth driven by more discipline in cadence of launching products. They had products available for the rest of the world. We didn't do particularly a good job in launching products on a global basis, and we reinvigorate that, and we have so many good products with good invention and innovation in-house. So those are really exciting and they're creating momentum in the company.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking the question. It's more of a macro question. Your Fluid Systems, your Hospital Products business all grew very strongly in the U.S. and very specific to the company in your execution. But I was wondering if in the second quarter you saw any favorable macro trends? In other words, did you see any pick-up in hospital admissions or surgical volumes? I wonder if you can speak to and address the health of the U.S. market in general, Joe? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Glenn. We see a slight uptick in the procedure volume, probably 3% or 4% growth in the U.S. This is a good thing for us with the Fluid Systems being driven primarily by that. Also a good flu season helped. It was important this year; more use of fluids and pumps. We see the environment in the U.S. is stable, not with a trajectory of growth that we probably saw before, but with growth as we see unemployment still subdued and below, sub-5%. So it is a good trend for the country.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And...","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And they're continuing.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just on an unrelated, just I wanted to get back to Bob's question on M&A, I believe it was handled at the Analyst Day or one of the previous calls, you talked about Integrated Pharmacy Solutions and that's a business on the M&A front, I believe you used the words you wanted to double down. And you also just mentioned on this call that there were four deals that you just passed up on in the last 90 days. So were some of these deals in the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions? And why has the dynamic become so competitive of late? Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, ahead of answering my question. I will say to you that there are very few areas of growth if you think about the healthcare and about the targets. The multiples in EBITDA are skyrocketing in some areas. Go figure out why. I just saw a couple of deals, one that just got concluded in the U.S. on the front-end generics company, the multiples are extremely high for a capability more than anything else because the company did not make any products. So we have those capabilities in-house. We look at some of these deals and we don't see the price, the coherence between price and value. And I think when we don't see the coherence and it does meet our expectations \u2013 we have a very established guidelines with our board that reflect our best interest of our shareholders \u2013 I would say we will not step into those deals.","We walked away from another deal that had a significant difference between us and a foreign party was trying to buy the company. There is not a deal that is important enough that will make us spend our shareholders' money in vain. So we're going to continue to pursue the couple of deals on the table right now that we think are actionable. We are pursuing them but we are going to always keep our eyes on value.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on an excellent quarter. Jay, I was wondering if you could talk about Brexit and the impact both on sales overall but specifically as it relates to FX, your exposure to the U.K.?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great and thanks for the question. Overall, from a volume standpoint, we don't expect an impact from some of the macro challenges we're seeing in Europe. Most of our product lines are more steady stream from a unit standpoint, so we don't really anticipate an impact in that sense.","From a foreign exchange standpoint, really, we have a number of hedges and opportunities that we have. So as it relates to the U.K., we have roughly 5% of our sales in the U.K. We do have a manufacturing plant in the U.K. that provides natural hedge against fluctuations in that currency. And then in the eurozone area, we have a number of plants, so as the euro moves, we do have natural offsets to sales \u2013 the currency fluctuations in that market as well.","But the other thing that we do is we use synthetic hedges or derivatives, principally options, to hedge foreign currency exposure. And we have a well-disciplined approach where we hedge out up to five or six quarters. We hedge roughly 20% per quarter, and we use options, which really caps the downside associated with those instruments.","Now, for us, as we evaluated the Brexit situation leading up to that particular event, we actually did a couple things. We increased our exposure or increased our derivative positions on the pound and increased our derivative positions on the euro as well as an insurance policy to ensure that there would be no adverse impact this year or next year. And so the result of that is, despite the movement in the pound and the euro, we really offset some of the translational impact of the P&L with gains associated with those derivatives that we've put in place, and we're very pleased with the situation that we're currently in.","The other item that we did is, as the yen strengthened, we did take the opportunity to increase some of our exposure, again, using options so that the downside is limited to the yen. So we hedged some of our incremental yen positions at basically \u00a5100 to $1. Again, a trade that we were pleased with and situated us well for both this year and next year from a foreign exchange risk standpoint.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And if I could follow up one more macro question following up on Glenn's question about U.S. volumes. Ex-U.S., there is a little bit more uncertainty, turmoil, if you want to call it that in emerging markets also in Europe. Just wondering what you're seeing from a volume trend, procedure volume trend ex-U.S. and whether that's offsetting some of the strength we're seeing here in the U.S.? Thanks so much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There is a very high diversity of scenarios. So you have China with pretty stable market regarding our products, the products we serve the Chinese market in terms of pricing, but you always have the trend of risk of price controls and things like that. We've always seen China with a pretty stable outlook as well as some parts of Latin America, even Brazil depending on \u2013 independently of the currency situation. You still have Brazil with good prospects for growth, Colombia, Mexico.","I will say when you move away from emerging markets, developed markets such as Australia have very strong growth, good performance. And we see our markets there for areas like hospital admissions, but we see that via our compounding business there, that is doing very well, no issues. I would say Europe is always a point of attention with very slow growth in most of the five large countries in Europe with some exceptions in parts of probably England and Spain, we see a little bit of growth there. But it is a market that we are being very careful with how we compete, we are very disciplined in pricing, but we see that market a bit more tenuous than the rest of the developed markets.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Joe, I wanted to come back to emerging markets. I think if I have got the math right, you've probably done somewhere in the 4%-ish range growth in the first half of the year. I think on the first quarter call you were talking about more like 9% to 10% growth for 2016 after you do some adjusting for the Renal situation in China. So I want to see if the thoughts around that kind of high-single digit growth, 9%, 10% are still in place? And if so, what gets you from that kind of 4%-ish range to 9%, 10% for the year?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The 9%, 10% for the year is towards the back end of the year. Then we also have China being the biggest driver. So think about the size of China for our business is over $600 million in sales, and that drives a lot of the numbers when you look at emerging markets and primarily Asia. China, there was \u2013 we walked away from an unprofitable bid last year for PD patients. And because we lost those patients, the impact was felt this year in the first and second quarter anniversaried \u2013 just anniversaried. So we're going to see a recovery in China by the third and fourth quarter, which subsequently will create the momentum for the growth rate that we have outlined.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Overall, Larry, what I would say is that, we expect emerging market growth for the full year in line with the guidance that we provided at our May Investor Conference of around 5% to 6%. So that's the outlook for the full year. As Jay referenced earlier, there are certain markets and products that we're going to be exiting or not participating in those tenders. A lot of those are in emerging markets, and that in fact will be in the fourth quarter. So that will depress growth in the fourth quarter in emerging markets. But overall, we'll grow in line with that guidance that we outlined in May.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Okay. Terrific. That's very clear. And lastly, just on CRRT, obviously the growth has been very impressive. I was wondering if you can deconstruct that a little bit as to what's really driving that? Is that market share gains? Is it increasing use of the therapy? And how do we think about the runway for that growth? How sustainable is it?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is all of the above. So the way to deconstruct \u2013 see the underlying growth for acute renal care, which uses CRRT technology to be at 10%, 11% growth business. And we have benefited from a couple of things. One is we've been gaining market share from other modalities on top of the growth of usage of that technology. Now, we can see there by the sales of equipment by sales of capital. So when we have the sales of capital being increased, we know that the pull through will happen, but we need to be at the hospitals to make sure that that technology is used instead of flat or something else. So it's a very good underlying market growth.","Second is, there was a supply issue in the marketplace, primarily in the U.S. And Baxter is always there for our customers. We're able to supply products for our patients and by doing so, we were able to help our hospitals as well as create some momentum and potential conversion opportunities of those accounts, because not all of them probably will go back to the original manufacturer who was in that quarter and shorten the market. So we'll be able to pick that up in the near future.","So it is a great business for us, hence our ability to continue to tag other technologies like PrismaLung and the other things we spoke in May at our Investor Day because it's a real door-opener into the ICU for us.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","The only other thing I would add, too, is the first half of the year really benefited from a strong flu season that we don't expect that to repeat in the second half of the year. So that's why the growth in the acute will kind of come down to the levels that Joe referenced earlier in terms of the underlying market growth rates.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Okay. Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO. Your line is now open.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Terrific quarter and good morning. When I take a look at your third quarter guidance and full-year guidance and we back into the fourth quarter, it looks like you're looking at about 2% ex-FX. Some of that I suspect is cyclo. Some of that is probably flu because it's not going to be there, but how would we sort of peel away that somewhat lower organic revenue growth rate versus what you just delivered in the second quarter?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. There is two factors. One is cyclo, which is about one and a half points. This year, the biggest year-over-year impact will be in the fourth quarter as we assume the entrance of a couple of new competitors to that business. So that's about $40 million or a point and a half.","The other item is, it's more of a sales than a profit impact, but we regularly look at our portfolio and we'll walk away from certain sales that are below a margin threshold. And in the case of Q4, as we planned and expected, there are certain things that we are walking away from that will impact the fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points as well. So in combination, those two items yield roughly three points of growth to the fourth quarter.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That makes sense. Thank you. And then as my follow-up question, the U.S. Fluid Systems number is so wonderfully strong. How do we get that going outside the United States? Not that I'm asking for more, but just asking. Thank you.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have a very nice base of pumps installed outside the U.S. still, with significant amount of channels and we through partnerships right now and a strong group work with our partner, we will be able to launch products in the future. Not too far, then we will start replacing our fleet outside the U.S. and continue to grow with more variety and different types of pumps that we need to sustain that business. I think that was the key.","As we look back and thought about the priorities, U.S. is still a big priority business in terms of pumps. But as we have seen the SPECTRUM growing and have new versions coming up in product development, it's for us now to focus outside the U.S. with our global product line and I think we have better strategy in the products line now to do so, so we'll be coming out soon with new products that will create momentum outside U.S. and protect our base.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Joanne, the only other comment to add is in the second quarter, growth was adversely impacted because we had a shipment to a particular country, Canada last year, of pumps. So it was a bullish order that we had that impacted growth several percentage points in the Fluid Systems business. So that negative 1% \u2013 we actually saw mid-single digit growth in IV therapy, which was a solid performer in the quarter, but we did have the overhang of that one order.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Matt Keeler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, now that the retained stake utilization has been completed, were there any changes versus your prior thinking to the P&L guide?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","To what?","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Our P&L guide. Any changes to our P&L guidance.","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Oh, yeah, no, we're broadly in line. I mean, look, we were very pleased with the execution of the retained stake. Frankly, the tax, treasury and legal team here at Baxter worked very hard in the face of the Shire transaction to execute on those transactions in a timely manner, exactly as we expected it. And so from our standpoint, broad brush, we had anticipated about $0.15 of impact this year, we'll experience $0.15 of impact this year, and we're very thankful and appreciative of all the hard work that allowed us to get to that stage.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Matt, are you there?","James K. Saccaro - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think we lost him.","Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh, yeah, I'm here. Sorry, guys. Just the \u2013 just to wrap it up, the reallocation of spend from VIVIA to PD and biosurgery, any more color you can give us on where that spending will go? And is there any impact there to the either revenue or expense guidance for the year?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A couple of examples; we have several, but we'll give three to you. One is we're going to be launching the variant of our pump sets outside the U.S. that we need. So some money is going there. And we're doubling the R&D dollars going into biosurgery. We've just launched several different programs in biosurgery. And lastly, our point of care is now being fully funded as we're planning to come into the U.S. in about three years with a new point of care to provide patients with on-demand manufacturing of peritoneal dialysis solution in the home.","So good use of that money. That's one of the reasons that didn't flow through \u2013 will not flow through the bottom-line. We just have better uses for that money, very consistent with our capital allocation policy, as well as we see great opportunity across the board in many organic opportunities.","And one last to mention is IPS. Actually we accelerated all the molecules that were out slated for 2019, 2020, 2021 to come earlier and that program costs money and we're funding that as well with some of the PTO money. So a great organic opportunities in the company. We could not pass the opportunity of putting money in the right places.","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen...","Clare Trachtman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Go ahead and conclude the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call of Baxter International.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, and thank you all for calling in.","2014 was a great year for our company and I'm very pleased with our achievements and progress we've made from a financial, operational, scientific and strategic perspective.","First, we were successful in meeting or exceeding our financial objectives with accelerated growth in sales, solid earnings and significant cash flow. And we've consistently executed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances reinvestment in the business with returning value to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and share repurchases.","Positive momentum continues to build across the commercial franchises as we extend our global reach with the core portfolio, enhance care with the introduction of several new products and position both businesses for sustained success.","We're balancing this with investments in commercial and operational excellence as well as manufacturing capacity to improve our competitive position and support the solid underlying fundamentals in future demand that we foresee for Baxter's products and therapies across the globe.","We're also transforming innovation and advancing the pipeline with the achievement of significant clinical and regulatory milestones, while expanding the portfolio through acquisitions and collaborations.","And most notably, in 2014, we reached a significant milestone in Baxter's history as we remain committed to driving long-term value for shareholders with the creation of 2 independent publicly traded companies in mid-2015, providing investors with 2 unique and compelling investment opportunities.","Before turning the call over to Bob Hombach for a discussion of the financial results and future outlook, let me take just a few minutes to reflect on a number of the achievements from the past year.","First, strong sales performance reflects our strategic focus on improving access and treatment standards, broadening our global presence while investing to support future growth.","Baxter's worldwide revenues totaled $16.7 billion in 2014, advancing 11% or 5%, excluding Gambro and foreign exchange.","International sales, representing nearly 60% of Baxter's total revenues, were augmented by significant growth in emerging markets with sales in the BRIC countries advancing by more than 15%.","Continued emerging market penetration represents a significant opportunity for both businesses going forward as many products and therapies remain underpenetrated, diagnosed or treated.","For example, in Medical Products, we continue to drive global penetration for higher-margin specialty products, including those from BioSurgery and nutrition franchises, with the expanded launches of FLOSEAL in Japan, HEMOPATCH in Europe and our proprietary triple-chamber nutritional containers in several new markets like China, Brazil, Australia and France.","To address strong demand across our hospital products and renal portfolio, we announced plans to invest approximately $600 million to expand capacity and enhance production capabilities in several key markets and product areas, representing some of the greatest opportunities for future growth. These include investments in Asia and at our North Carolina facility to support production of peritoneal dialysis and intravenous solutions.","We're also executing on expansion plans at our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Opelika, Alabama to meet the growing global demand for dialyzers.","In addition, we've successfully executed on the integration of Gambro, achieving the commercial and cost benefits that we anticipated and further extending our global reach with a comprehensive renal therapies portfolio.","In BioScience, we're building upon our global leadership position in hemophilia, as evidenced by our strong double-digit revenue growth for 2014.","Highlights for this franchise include: supporting rising standards of care for approximately 100,000 patients, more than 1\/4 of the world's hemophilia A patients in key markets like the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Russia and China with recent product approvals, launches and multiyear tender awards. Second, driving personalized care with the launch of BAXJECT III reconstitution system and myPKFit in Europe, Canada and Japan. And thirdly, the European regulatory approval of a new manufacturing facility in Singapore for the production of recombinant proteins, including ADVATE and eventually BAX 855.","Within our BioTherapeutics franchise, we remain committed to meeting patient needs by enhancing our plasma manufacturing footprint in a flexible and cost-efficient manner.","We've increased capacity at our Los Angeles and Vienna, Austria plasma fractionation facilities. We're investing in a new state-of-the-art facility in Covington, Georgia, and we're making progress with the Sanquin collaboration.","These efforts have led to improved growth throughout 2014, capping the year off with strong double-digit growth for this franchise during the fourth quarter.","As you know, we've significantly ramped up R&D over the last several years and are now beginning to realize the benefits.","In 2014, the company received regulatory approval for almost a dozen new products and therapies. We also announced an array of significant pipeline achievements and advanced many of our R&D collaborations with partners.","In Medical Products, we obtained 510(k) clearance for the next-generation SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump in the United States and further advanced development of AMIA and HomeChoice Claria, our latest automated PD systems for the U.S. and European markets.","In BioScience, we received FDA approval of several key therapies, including HYQVIA, which we launched in the United States in the fourth quarter.","HYQVIA is a transformational subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with primary immunodeficiency. Our launch is progressing well with more than 400 physicians currently prescribing the therapy.","We were granted FDA approval for OBIZUR, a treatment for patients with acquired hemophilia A, a very rare and potentially life-threatening acute bleeding disorder as well as the pediatric indication for RIXUBIS for the treatment of hemophilia B. In addition, we recently received European approval for RIXUBIS for both pediatric and adult patients.","During 2014, we achieved several regulatory milestones, including positive top line results from the Phase III pivotal clinical trial of BAX 855, an extended half-life recombinant Factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. We also met the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III study of BAX 111, the first standalone recombinant treatment for von Willebrand disease.","And late last year, we successfully completed the FDA regulatory submissions for both BAX 855 and BAX 111 with approvals expected later in 2015.","In addition to our internal R&D accomplishments, we're collaborating with partners to advance R&D programs in new disease areas, which capitalize on our core technical capabilities, expertise and global channel. These collaborations include the partnership with Coherus Biosciences and the initiation of 2 Phase III trials for an investigational etanercept biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis and advancement of pivotal trials for pacritinib with our partner, CTI BioPharma.","Pacritinib is a novel oral JAK2\/FLT3 inhibitor for patients with myelofibrosis, a chronic malignant bone marrow disorder, and we expect clinical trials results for PERSIST-1 later in the first quarter of 2015.","In 2014, we augmented internal development programs with select acquisitions and new collaborations. Within Medical Products, we entered an exclusive agreement with Rockwell Medical for their leading hemodialysis concentrates in select markets, which enhances Baxter's comprehensive range of therapeutic options across home, in-center and hospital settings for patients with end-stage renal disease.","And earlier this year, we acquired ICNet, a global leader in surveillance and case management software used in hospitals, which builds on Baxter's unique expertise at hospital pharmacy operations.","In BioScience, the organization continues to enhance its focus on specific disease areas centered on its expertise in hematology, oncology and immunology as well as through technology platforms, including gene therapy and biosimilars.","During 2014, we bolstered the portfolio with acquisitions like AesRx and Chatham Therapeutics and extended our collaboration with Xenetic Biosciences.","The AesRx acquisition expands our reach in hematology with BAX 555, an investigational oral prophylactic treatment being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial for patients with sickle cell anemia.","With Chatham Therapeutics' acquisition, we obtained their development gene therapy preclinical hemophilia A and ongoing hemophilia B program, which is currently in a Phase I\/II trial. This approach has the potential to redefine the concept of longer-acting therapy, and we plan this year additional data on this program at the European Association for Hemophilia and Allied Disorders in Helsinki in February.","The exclusive agreement with Xenetic Biosciences is a partnership for the development of BAX 826, an extended half-life recombinant Factor VIII therapy for hemophilia A. BAX 826 is currently in preclinical development as a treatment that may be administered less frequently, potentially at once-weekly intervals without compromising efficacy.","Also in BioScience, we're building on the strategic decision to expand our presence in the area of hematology\/oncology, leveraging our heritage of success in developing new therapies that treat unmet medical needs for patients with rare diseases. We now have several oncology assets, including our most advanced asset, MM-398, for pancreatic cancer, which will be submitted for approval in markets outside the U.S. and Taiwan in 2015 as well as pacritinib mentioned earlier. Each of these new therapies offers the potential for numerous additional indications for patients with a variety of hematologic and solid malignancies.","In summary, our core portfolio remains strong, and we continue to benefit from our focus on life-saving therapies, along with strong global channels that provide a platform for ongoing geographic expansion and growth. We're investing for the future to enhance our commercial, operational and scientific effectiveness. Our pipeline remains robust, and we've accelerated the pace of business development with opportunities that are aligned with our core strengths. And we're committed to overcoming the challenges presented by the external economic environment, while enhancing value through improved performance and execution.","So with that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Hombach for a discussion on our 2014 financial results and outlook. And when Bob concludes his commentary, I'll provide an update on the spinoff of our biopharmaceuticals business before opening up the call for Q&A. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 2% in the fourth quarter to $1.34, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.30 to $1.33 per share.","These results reflect strong revenue growth across several key franchises and continued investments in operations and research and development.","As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $1.74 per diluted share reflects both earnings and an after-tax gain from the recently divested vaccines franchise totaling $429 million or $0.78 per diluted share.","In addition, our GAAP results reflect after-tax special items totaling $209 million or $0.38 per diluted share for intangible amortization costs associated with business development and contingent milestone payments, integration of the company's acquisition of Gambro AB and Baxter's planned separation.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2015.","Starting with sales. Worldwide sales of approximately $4.5 billion advanced 3% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%, reflecting a sequential improvement in growth over the last 4 quarters from an organic perspective. This growth also favorably compares to our guidance for the quarter of approximately 3%.","Each product category contributed to the overachievement with particular strength coming from the hemophilia franchise, driven by ADVATE and FEIBA, and strong U.S. performance across the Medical Products portfolio.","Sales in the U.S. increased 6% and international sales, excluding foreign currency, increased 7%.","As Bob mentioned, sales in emerging markets were strong, advancing by more than 15% in the quarter with robust growth in the BRIC markets, driven by hemophilia sales in Brazil and the timing of tenders as expected.","For the full year, worldwide sales of nearly $16.7 billion advanced 11% on a reported basis or 13% on a constant currency basis.","Baxter's sales for the full year increased 5% on a constant currency basis when excluding Gambro revenues from both periods. Gambro sales were $1.6 billion in 2014 compared to $513 million in 2013.","In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter and advanced 9% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, BioScience sales increased 12%, reflecting the highest quarterly growth in the last 5 years. For the full year, global BioScience sales advanced 7% to $6.7 billion. After adjusting for foreign currency, sales grew 8%, significantly exceeding our original expectation of sales growth in the 3% to 4% range for 2014.","Within the product category, hemophilia sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $1.1 billion increased 9% on a reported basis, and excluding foreign currency, sales advanced 13%.","While sales in the U.S. were strong, up 8%, international sales grew 16% on a constant currency basis.","As mentioned in Bob's opening remarks, international penetration remains a significant opportunity for our company as hemophilia is a disease that remains tremendously underdiagnosed and undertreated around the world. As the established global leader, Baxter today derives approximately 60% of total hemophilia sales from outside the U.S. in more than 60 countries worldwide. In addition, in the quarter, we achieved a record level of ADVATE sales with a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This was the result of strong global demand, prophy conversions, benefits from recent tender wins in the U.K. and Australia and conversion to recombinant therapy in Brazil.","For the year, sales in Brazil totaled more than $100 million, in line with our expectations, and to date, we have converted approximately 40% of the estimated 10,000 hemophilia A patients in the country.","In the U.S., where we face new competition, our recombinant Factor VIII sales outpaced market growth. In fact, for 2014, we've enhanced our overall Factor VIII unit share position despite a more competitive environment and modest patient losses.","We were also pleased that growth in our hemophilia franchise was further augmented by the launch of several new products and indications, including double-digit growth of FEIBA for the treatment of hemophilia patients with inhibitors as well as contribution from RIXUBIS, a Factor IX treatment for hemophilia B patients, and the recent launch of OBIZUR for acquired hemophilia.","In BioTherapeutics, sales of $628 million increased 11% on a reported basis. Sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis, driven by robust demand, particularly for immunoglobulin therapies and albumin.","Throughout 2014, we enhanced our overall supply of plasma therapies as we successfully executed to increase capacity across our manufacturing network. We are now in a position to support ongoing growth in demand of at least 8% going forward.","A significant achievement in the fourth quarter was the launch of HYQVIA in the U.S. This is a transformational therapy with an attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and payers. For 2014, Baxter successfully increased global subQ penetration, including U.S. HYQVIA sales in the fourth quarter of $35 million, which primarily reflects the impact of initial stocking orders by customers and the favorable reception of the product in the marketplace.","In BioSurgery, sales of $197 million grew 2%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 4%, driven by increased penetration of surgical sealants despite modest growth in surgical procedures and some competitive pricing pressures. As you may recall, the BioSurgery business will be reported in the Medical Products business going forward.","In Medical Products, global sales of approximately $2.6 billion were comparable to the prior year, and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%. For the full year, Medical Products sales rose 15% to approximately $10 million, and on a constant currency basis, the sales growth was 16%. After adjusting for Gambro in both periods, Medical Products sales in 2014 increased 4% on a constant currency basis.","Within the product categories, Renal sales in the quarter were approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting a decline of 2% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign currency, sales grew 3%, driven by solid PD patient gains in the U.S. and emerging markets and improved performance from the Gambro HD business.","For the year, Gambro sales were in line with our expectations and exceeded $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately 2% on an organic basis.","While sales in the first half of 2014 were comparable to the prior year, we are encouraged with the acceleration of sales to mid-single digits in the second half of 2014, driven primarily by mid-teens growth of the acute care business and improved dialyzer sales.","Within the Fluid Systems category, sales of $822 million were comparable to the prior year period, and on a constant currency basis, sales grew 2%. Performance was driven by favorable demand for IV therapies as well as increased sales of cyclophosphamide, which collectively more than offset lower sales of infusion pumps.","As you may know, a new competitor recently entered the U.S. market for cyclophosphamide, and we continue to expect additional competitors in the coming months.","For your reference, full year 2014 U.S. cyclophosphamide sales totaled approximately $450 million.","Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $417 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 2%.","Sales rose 6% on a constant currency basis as we continue to penetrate international markets with our higher-margin anesthesia portfolio and achieve strong growth in our U.S. nutrition business with improved sales of vitamins and lipids, which were constrained last year.","Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $271 million, increasing 1% on a reported basis or 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily to increased demand from our contract manufacturing partners and strong hospital pharmacy compounding revenues.","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin in the quarter was 50.3% compared to 50.4% last year. Positive mix in BioScience and select pricing improvements across the portfolio were more than offset by the impact of foreign currency as well as expedited freight for PD solutions, ongoing manufacturing inefficiencies and investments we are making to enhance operational capabilities and advance our quality systems and processes. For the full year, the gross margin of 50.4% was in line with our guidance.","SG&A totaled $970 million and increased 4%, driven by planned investments and promotional and marketing initiatives for new product launches in BioScience and incremental customer freight and logistical expenses to support the strong demand for IV solutions.","R&D spending in the quarter of $305 million increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by the addition of new R&D programs in BioScience through acquisitions, the acceleration of other programs in the areas of hematology, oncology and immunology and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the continuum of care.","Interest expense was $29 million in the fourth quarter compared to $41 million last year as we benefited from recent debt maturities and income generated from a change in the mix of floating versus fixed interest rates.","Other expense totaled $25 million and was driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange on balance sheet positions.","The tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, bringing the full year tax rate to 21.7% in line with our expectations.","And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 2% to $1.34, and for the full year 2014, earnings per diluted share of $4.90 exceeded our guidance range.","Turning to cash flow. For 2014, cash flow from operations was very strong and totaled more than $3.2 billion. Excluding cash costs associated with the spinoff of the biopharmaceutical business, we generated $3.3 billion in cash flow from operations.","Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting investments in manufacturing capacity to support future demand and growth across the portfolio.","DSO ended the quarter at 52 days, and excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 50 days, lower than the prior year by more than 2 days.","Inventory turns of 2.4 are lower than the prior year period by 0.3 days, driven by the impact of new product launches and enhanced inventories in our plasma business.","And lastly, in 2014, the company repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares for $550 million, or on a net basis, 1.3 million shares for $206 million.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing some information on the financial outlook and assumptions affecting our performance in 2015.","As I've previously mentioned, given the complexities of a midyear spend, we are not in a position today to provide full year guidance for Baxter and Baxalta. As we move into the second quarter of 2015, Baxter will likely begin reporting Baxalta as a discontinued operation, and at our investor conferences in May, each company will provide additional information on their financial profile and outlook.","Today, we will provide investors with some relevant information on several key discrete challenges we expect to face in 2015.","First, given significant volatility in foreign currency rates, particularly in emerging markets and more recently the euro, we expect a full year impact of approximately $0.40 per diluted share related to foreign exchange.","Given the timing of currency movements, the impact of our hedging strategy and our geographic mix, the majority of this impact is expected to occur in the second half of 2015.","Second, with interest rates much lower as we exited 2014, pension expense will be a headwind of approximately $0.10 per diluted share for the year.","Third, given the assumption that we will experience additional competition for cyclophosphamide throughout 2015, we are assuming a full year impact of approximately $0.40 per diluted share.","And lastly, as previously mentioned, we are incurring additional costs that reflect manufacturing inefficiencies and investments to enhance operational capabilities, creating an additional headwind in the first quarter of approximately $0.10 per diluted share. As we move into the second half of 2015, we expect these costs to stabilize as we begin to anniversary these impacts.","Let me take a few moments to provide full year sales guidance for the 2 businesses and the major product categories for 2015.","Recall that given the spin, we have taken the opportunity to step back and look at our organizational structure to ensure that we're best positioned to successfully operate 2 standalone companies. Therefore, we are moving to a new reporting configuration that is aligned with the respected internal organizations and are providing guidance in this new format this morning.","For your convenience, we posted the historical restated sales, including 2014 by quarter, to the Investor Relations section of our website.","Beginning with the new Baxter franchises, on a constant currency basis, we expect sales to be comparable to 2014. Excluding cyclophosphamide in both years, underlying growth will be approximately 3%. Specifically, we expect sales in our Renal franchise, which includes our leading peritoneal and hemodialysis products, to grow in the 4% to 5% range. We expect Fluid Systems sales to grow in the 2% to 3% range. This franchise includes our IV therapies, infusion pumps and associated disposables.","We expect sales of our Surgical Care franchise to grow in the 4% to 5% range. This franchise includes anesthesia and BioSurgery products.","We expect the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions sales to decline approximately 10%. This franchise includes injectable drugs like cyclophosphamide as well as our nutritional therapies and hospital pharmacy compounding business. Excluding the impact of cyclophosphamide of approximately $300 million, growth is expected to be in the low single digits.","And finally, we expect the other category to decline approximately 15%. This category primarily includes our third-party manufacturing business, which will be impacted by a major customer electing to self-manufacture products previously manufactured by Baxter.","For Baxalta, we project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, of approximately 3% to 4%. Our outlook includes growth in the hemophilia franchise of 0% to 2%. This includes sales of our recombinant and plasma-derived hemophilia therapies, including ADVATE, RIXUBIS and other treatments for Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiencies. Growth will be fueled by new product launches and strong international demand, which will be somewhat offset by anticipated high single-digit share loss in the U.S. due to increased competition.","We expect growth in the inhibitors category to be in the 6% to 8% range, driven by further penetration and growth of FEIBA for the treatment of inhibitors and the launch of OBIZUR for the treatment of acquired hemophilia.","For immunoglobulin therapies, which includes our antibody replacement treatments, we expect growth of 6% to 8%, driven by strong market demand and the contribution from HYQVIA.","And finally, for BioTherapeutics, which includes plasma-derived therapies like albumin and treatments for alpha-1 deficiencies among others, we expect to grow in the 2% to 4% range.","Now turning to the first quarter. We expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share, reflecting the headwinds just mentioned. It is important to note, however, that this guidance does not reflect any incremental cost or dis-synergies associated with the spinoff of the biopharmaceutical business as these costs will begin to be layered in throughout the second quarter.","Now in terms of the P&L by line item, we expect first quarter sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of 2% to 3%. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales to decline 3% to 4%.","By business, on a constant currency basis, we expect Medical Products sales growth of 1% to 2% and BioScience sales to grow 4% to 5%.","In the first quarter, we expect gross margin for the company to decline by approximately 250 to 300 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year of 50.4%. This reflects the impact of increased manufacturing costs, which are most pronounced in the first quarter, as well as the impact of cyclophosphamide and pension expense.","We expect SG&A to decline by approximately 5% versus the prior year and R&D to be flat on a reported basis. Excluding foreign currency impacts, both SG&A and R&D are expected to grow in low single digits.","And finally, for the first quarter, we expect interest expense to total approximately $35 million, no impact from other income versus gains we recorded in the prior year, and we expect a tax rate of approximately 22% with an average share count of approximately 547 million shares.","This concludes my prepared remarks this morning. We look forward to providing more financial information to you in the near future.","In the meantime, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob for his closing comments.","Robert L. Parkinson","Thanks, Bob. Let me end our prepared comments this morning with a brief update on the anticipated spinoff of our biopharmaceuticals business.","Our organization has been fully engaged in separation activity since the announcement that we made last March, and we're energized by the prospects of separating Baxter into 2 leading global health care companies, one focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life-saving medical products. This decision supports Baxter's evolution and underscores our commitment to ensuring long-term strategic priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest, while creating value for patients, health care providers and other key stakeholders.","The 2 businesses operate in distinct markets with corresponding underlying fundamentals and each possesses unique and compelling growth prospects, investment requirements and risk profiles. The spinoff will create 2 well-capitalized, independent companies with strong balance sheets, investment-grade profiles and disciplined approaches to capital allocation.","The spin will also provide greater management focus, the ability to more effectively commercialize new and existing product offerings to drive innovation and enhance our flexibility to pursue respective growth and investment strategies. This will result in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns for shareholders.","During 2014, we named our senior leadership teams for both companies, established the international and commercial structures for both organizations, formally unveiled Baxalta Incorporated as the name of the new publicly traded biopharmaceutical company and filed a preliminary Form-10 with the SEC for Baxalta.","While we continue to work through the complexities, this process is unfolding in line with our expectations, and we continue on track toward a mid-2015 completion.","We recently announced that we'll be hosting an investor conference in New York City on the afternoon of May 18 for Baxter International and on the morning of May 19 for Baxalta Incorporated.","At these conferences, we'll introduce you to the new senior management teams and provide investors with more information regarding the strategies, growth prospects, capital structure and financial outlooks for each company.","We'll also engage in a comprehensive Investor Relations effort, including investor road shows for both companies with their respective senior management teams several weeks before the spinoff is completed.","In closing, while 2015 will be a challenging year, momentum in the core business is building and we remain excited about our future prospects, and we're poised for improved performance in 2016 and beyond.","As we chart distinct and unique paths forward as separate global health care leaders, we look forward to unlocking value for shareholders, partners, employees and the patients and health care providers that we serve.","As always, I'll be happy to take any questions on these or other topics during the Q&A. So with that, I'd now like to open up the call to your questions, if we might.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I'd like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International's website for 30 days at www.baxter.com.","Our first question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Brittany Henderson in for Kristen. I just wanted to kind of get more clarity as we think about 2015. How should we just think about the incremental standalone costs versus kind of the stranded costs associated with the Baxalta spin?","Robert J. Hombach","Okay. Well, we're still working -- as we mentioned, we're still working through the details around that. We've talked about initial dis-synergies of approximately $300 million or approximately 2% of Baxter's current sales. Interestingly enough, almost half of that is going to relate to IT-related costs, and we will be working towards separating the IT infrastructure over time, but that is one of the longer lead time items. So that is actually a difficult thing to break out at this point. Our initial estimate was a little bit heavier towards Baxalta in terms of dis-synergies, but a fair amount of stranded cost for new Baxter given, again, some of this IT overlap for some period of time. But at this point, I'm still working through those details. That's part of what we look to address in the May investor conferences where each of the 2 companies will lay out the financial outlooks.","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. How should we think about Suprane in 2015? What are the assumptions for competition there?","Robert L. Parkinson","This is Bob Parkinson, Brittany. We anticipate Suprane is going to continue to grow in 2015. Having said that, we also anticipate that we may get generic competition in various markets around the world, although as we sit here today, it's not evident when or if or who that will be. I will tell you that there continues -- it continues to be promotionally sensitive in many markets around the world. So longer term, we view the anesthesia contract -- franchise with Suprane as kind of a foundation product as a growth vehicle, not only in '15, but, frankly, over our LRP.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually James in for David. Just wanted to get a quick sense from you. The first quarter earnings guidance of $0.85 to $0.90, how representative do you think that is of where the business stands from a profitability or earnings power basis today? On the one hand, obviously, you've got some idiosyncratic headwinds from quality spending that are going to fade through the year. But on the other hand, it seems as if FX and any potential ADVATE competitive impact would get greater through the year. So is 1Q kind of a reasonable representation where the business stands today? Or is it wrong?","Robert J. Hombach","As we've looked at the situation, there are clearly some things in Q1 that are more pronounced. The $0.10 in manufacturing, clearly, is something that is very much front-end loaded. Overall manufacturing, just to give you a sense, is definitely a meaningful headwind in the first half of the year but a slight tailwind in the back half of the year, and so that clearly is not representative of what the ongoing situation is with the company. FX and cyclo are clearly meaningful headwinds here, both around $0.40. They will be somewhat back-end loaded, particularly FX. We're very well hedged in the first half of the year on the euro and a few other key currencies. But again, as we've been highlighting for 6 months, the emerging market depreciation in currencies that happened in the back half of 2014 is still very much there, and we're much more exposed as well. So Q1, I would say, is definitely not representative. And as a general matter from a seasonality standpoint, it's usually, by far, our lowest quarter from an earnings perspective in any given year.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just second, any help that you could give us on hemophilia guidance? Obviously, you've done very well in that business, strong double digits -- or double digits at a minimum for the past several quarters, decelerating to 0% to 2% next year. Clearly, there's some competitive impact there. But how do you think about balancing the U.S. competitive impact versus the continued strength internationally?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Well, this is Ludwig, James. First of all, the hemophilia team is doing a great job, as you see from the numbers. We will continue to grow ADVATE faster than market internationally. So internationally, we'll see positive growth. In the U.S., as Bob was alluding to, our guidance of high single-digit market share loss between -- from the Biogen launch to 855's launch is still a guidance. This will result in a negative growth in the U.S. With respect to our sales guidance, as we said, hemophilia, this is the base business only. It's 0% to 2% for the year. We have a separate sales guidance for the inhibitor market. Our business will continue to grow 6% to 8%. So overall, when you take the 2 together, we're talking about those single digits market, low single-digit growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to start on HYQVIA, which, Bob, you gave some disclosure in your prepared remarks. I think you said that there are 400 prescribers as of now. Could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail on the launch? Was that a U.S. or a global number? And how are things going thus far domestically?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, David, I'll let Ludwig address that. Go ahead, Ludwig.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yes, thanks. So we're very pleased with the launch in the U.S. The 400 number that we gave you is the U.S. number only. So the interest is very high. We have a value proposition for the patient as well as for the payer. The value proposition for the patient, clearly, it's a subQ once a month with one needle. From a payer perspective, although we take a price premium of about 30%, we -- overall, the cost of the treatment is still a favorable number. Overall cost, we think, about 10% less because of the higher viability that we have with HYQVIA versus subQ. So overall, it's a very strong proposition for all of our key stakeholders. Our objective is that HYQVIA is become -- will become a leadership brand within the PI market long term. With respect to our 2015 guidance, you saw 6% to 8% for IG. We think that HYQVIA will be about $100 million for 2015.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then maybe secondly, just broadly on the U.S. businesses. I think this was one of the better quarters you've had domestically in quite some time, particularly in some of the more volume exposed or Medical Products businesses. Can you maybe just talk through some of the underlying dynamics in the U.S., what really drove -- got better this quarter? And your guidance doesn't -- does not seem to suggest that that's sustainable, but why would that be the case?","Ludwig N. Hantson","With respect to hemophilia, when I think about ADVATE, 2014 as well as the fourth quarter, we've seen an impact of 1 to 2 market share points from the Biogen launch over the last 6 months. However, when you take all the different pieces of the puzzle together here, the positive contribution of the prophy conversions, and we have more than 650 patients that converted to -- as a prophy, so that's positive contribution. In addition to the weight gain contribution, more than offset the share loss. So that's the dynamic that we have, and that's the reason why we are growing faster than the market. Then our projection for 2015, we will continue -- as we said, we're on track for a high single-digit market share loss for the year, but we will not only have a Biogen competition, our assumption is that we will also have new entries in the short-acting Factor VIII market segment.","Robert J. Hombach","Yes. And David, I would just add that given the momentum we've seen the last couple of quarters, we are sticking with our original assumption here of the high single-digit market share loss, but that may prove to be conservative.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. I guess, I was asking more broadly about your U.S. franchises across the board. I think if I look at the BioSurgery business, that did better. You had nice momentum in things like the specialty areas. Is that -- why wouldn't that continue in 2015?","Robert L. Parkinson","I think -- Bob Parkinson here, David. Yes, I think, in many of those areas, it will continue in '15. I think we're seeing a little more stability in the market in terms of hospital procedures and hospital activity compared to what it was earlier, which is encouraging. We're also managing out of our -- some of the supply constraints that we incurred earlier in the year and got in a much better position in the fourth quarter on both IV solutions and PD solutions, and we're bringing some more capacity online in '15. So I think the underlying fundamentals, whether it's the IV Fluid Systems business, whether it's parenteral nutrition, BioSurgery as you mentioned, anesthesia. And again, we'll expand on this when we get together at the investor conference and so on, but I think each of these product segments, these are not -- these are never going to be double-digit growers, but they're going to be solid single-digit growers. And we'll provide some more color on that when we get together in May.","Mary Kay Ladone","Yes, David, I think that -- yes, just to add -- it's Mary Kay. I will just say the decline in cyclo and in the other category are really predominantly what's driving the U.S. performance to where it is in 2015.","Robert L. Parkinson","And offsetting the strength in the other areas that I commented on. So you get some pretty large netting effects there, as you know.","Mary Kay Ladone","Correct. That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let me just -- I want to circle back to the first quarter guidance because that's what I'm getting the most questions on. So the $0.10 that you're calling out that's kind of the manufacturing impact, the quality upgrade, how much of that do you want us to think is ongoing versus onetime?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, as I mentioned, we will see, on a year-over-year basis, a meaningful improvement in the back half of the year. The nature of these are partly due to capacity expansion and the timing of that, which will come online in the first half of 2015. So that will certainly alleviate the need for some of the expedited freight and incremental logistical costs that we've been incurring. Other aspects of the process modifications that we're working through will take a little bit more time to work down as we work down the cost curve on that. These are well-established processes that we've been manufacturing PD and IV solutions for, for decades, so we'll take a little bit of time. So I would say a meaningful portion in the back half, some will linger into 2016.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So if we think about just the $0.85 to $0.90 starting point and recognizing the first quarter's historically like 22% to 23% of the year's earnings so it's not a best representation, but you still have in front of you the full impact of generic cyclos. It sounds like you're assuming the front-end part, but not the whole part, so there's still a little bit of a tail there. And then, obviously, you've got that, call it, $0.45 of dis-synergies from the split of the 2 companies. Is that the right way to think about it in terms of what's still in front of you in terms of the EPS headwinds that we won't see in the first quarter, but we'll still see at some later date?","Robert J. Hombach","Well, as it relates to cyclophosphamide, we do anticipate a pretty meaningful impact here in the first quarter. It won't be 1\/4 of the year, but it will be meaningful, and certainly, even the first -- excuse me, in the first quarter, we expect a meaningful impact. And in the first half, almost half of the full year impact we expect to see. As you know, when generics come in, the pricing volume dynamics start to play out pretty quickly. So that is fairly representative of what the full year is going to look like. As it relates to the dis-synergies estimate, again, we won't really see those in the P&L in any meaningful way until the back half of 2015. The initial estimate is around $300 million, but both of the 2 companies are going to get busy as quickly as possible post spin to start working those down. So how that plays into what our full year 2016 is going to look like, I don't anticipate that's going to be $300 million. I think it's going to be lower, and that will be part of what we lay out in the May time frame.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bob, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the outlook for Brazil in 2015. You obviously did as you anticipated for this year and achieved over $100 million in sales. But talk a little bit about what has to continue to happen on the conversions and where you think you are as you go towards that, I think, $200 million-ish target.","Robert L. Parkinson","Why don't you take that?","Ludwig N. Hantson","Yes. So we gave you a target of $200 million. Clearly, we're on track to achieve that over time. As far as the market is concerned, there are about 10,000 hemophilia A patients in Brazil. We have now converted more than 4,000 patients. As we convert from plasma to recombinant, we also convert those patients from on-demand to prophy, and our penetration of prophy in those patients is about closer to 70%. So we still have a long way to go, and that's where the additional $100 million opportunity is coming from. 2015 will be the next step in the journey that is going to take longer than 2 years to get to the 100% conversion.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, for Bob Parkinson, one thing that you've talked about is potential opportunities to establish other public-private relationships such as the Brazil hemophilia agreement. Could you provide any thoughts on -- do you think that's still viable in other either geographies or other product categories and when we may see something transpiring?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. I think it's -- Larry, I think it's going to be an increasing opportunity actually for both companies in both businesses because I think governments are going to be thrust in a position to kind of embrace new paradigms in terms of how they manage health care cost. And I think inevitably, it's going to involve collaborations with suppliers, certainly, leading suppliers in ways of doing business going forward that are different. So obviously, the Hemobr\u00e1s collaboration in Brazil on hemophilia has been well discussed and everybody understands that. But I mean, we're building a new solutions plant in Thailand to manufacture PD solutions, which was the direct result of us working with the Thai government to establish from a policy point of view peritoneal dialysis as the therapy of choice, not hemodialysis, largely because it's lower cost. It saves the government money, and in the process, we're making investments. We're creating jobs in Thailand. China is another good example where we've had a program that we'd refer to or describe internally as the Flying Angels project, which has really been another example of a great collaboration that's driving adoption of PD therapy. And I know Ludwig and his team continue to have discussions on various fronts as does new BAX. So I just think this is going to be a new way of doing business going forward, and I would anticipate in the coming years both companies will do more of these kinds of collaborations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit about if you could help us think about the capital structure of the 2 split businesses moving forward. Can you give us a sense for how we should think about, will debt be split evenly amongst the companies? And in terms of the dividend, how should we think about high level kind of dividend profile of the 2 businesses?","Robert J. Hombach","Derrick, this is Bob Hombach. As we've been saying, we're going to give the whole financial picture for both organizations, the financial outlook for sales, for earnings, CapEx spend and capital structure, including capital allocation assumptions, in the May time frame. A lot to work through as we work through the separation here and that act is obviously a very key aspect of this. We do believe both companies are going to generate significant cash flow going forward, and we'll have a significant amount of flexibility to be disciplined about capital allocation and to think about returning significant value to shareholders as we've been doing in the past, but also continue to reinvest in the businesses to support future growth. So we'll lay all that out in the May time frame.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Well, maybe then focusing a bit on the Baxter, the Medical Products business, for, I guess, either of the Bobs. You've talked a bit about the potential for a margin expansion opportunity coming out with a relatively lower margin relative to your peers. Could you help us think a little bit more about kind of -- does that margin expansion come primarily from mix shift? Is it -- we understand the Gambro piece to it. But beyond Gambro, where does that primarily come from and kind of how do we get there?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes, Derrick, Bob Parkinson here. Let me spend a couple of minutes responding to that. First of all, the comment about our returns being lower than peers, I think everybody understands one of the reasons for that is we are in very logistics-intensive businesses. Shipping IV solutions and PD solutions is expensive, so we have a freight distribution line on our P&L, which is inherent in those businesses as opposed to, let's say, traditional medical device or hospital supply businesses. Now having said that, what we will show you at the investor conference in May is a steady improvement over the LRP and operating margins that are very achievable and I think will be significant as well. And they really emanate from a series of things, and I'll just touch on a few in the interest of time. We clearly are going to increase our focus and investment in what I'll call higher-margin, higher-growth product categories, things like anesthesia, BioSurgery, parenteral nutrition, the acute -- the CRRT business in the hospital setting. These are all businesses today that range between $0.5 billion to $1 billion that are promotionally sensitive, have prospects for higher growth and are higher margin, so would represent a mix upgrade. Also, we're very excited about the engagement, if you will, in the infusion pump business with the approval of the SIGMA Spectrum Version 8. We'll be rolling that out in 2015 in the U.S. We effectively have been out of the infusion pump business for a number of years, and there's been a lot of margin that's been lost attendant [ph] with share loss with -- starting with the colleague, things and so on. So we're on the cusp of being able to get that back. Also, our new product low in new BAX and again, we'll get into this in detail in May, but VIVIA home hemodialysis, AMIA, the next-generation home PD solution, Prismaflex [ph], which is our next-generation CRRT. We have a program called Project Carrera [ph] internally, which is an array of premixed drugs that we'll be developing and bringing to the market in our proprietary GALAXY technology. These are all very exciting growth opportunities and new product opportunities, but all of which represent margins. In some cases, that are meaningfully higher than the overall margin percentage of the business. Clearly, we still have a lot of synergy to capture from Gambro going forward. It's tracking very well. We've achieved a lot of that, but there's still meaningful opportunity consistent with our original projections on Gambro synergies, both cost and commercial synergies. I think you'll see us managing portfolio very aggressively, both from a product and geography point of view. And to be very frankly -- to be very frank, I think the split off of the company provides a better line of sight to really focus on overhead infrastructure costs and so on, and you can anticipate that we're going to do some things in that regard to be proactive. So I'll stop there and will expand on each of these in detail in May. But each of the things I mentioned are meaningful, and that's why we're pretty confident about our ability to drive meaningful improvement over the long-range plan and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ludwig, could you just parse in the U.S. hemophilia guidance for next year, how much of the high single digits kind of ELOCTATE versus more standard competitive or recombinant Factor VIII? And just comment more generally on -- basically, all the surveys, everybody did, on the sell-side indicated that ELOCTATE would be much more impactful than it's proving to be. Does that -- and given the changes in hemophilia that are likely to occur over the next 5 years or so, does it speak at all to Baxter's competitive advantage in that space because of the intimacy you have with patients and caregivers? Just any general comments in that regard.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Well, it's a good question, thank you. With respect to the surveys, I think my answer would be we'll post the surveys. We have now 6 months of data. So at this point, the surveys are very qualitative, but the quantitative piece comes from the actual data. So that will be my answer to the survey question. With respect to the market itself, it's a very sticky market. We've seen this. We see this in Factor VIII. Now when you look at the market dynamics in IX, it's not much different with the new entrants including RIXUBIS. So the market, I believe, will continue to look for the standard treatment because we raised the bar, and the bar is very high. The bar is 0 blips. And when you look at the clinical data, 0 to 1 is where the SA data comes out, and that's a very high bar. So irrespective of the new technology, we're talking about an efficacy target, which is very high. We do believe that we have a very strong strategy in place, starting from the gold standard ADVATE moving to 855, which is ADVATE in a PEGylated form to known technologies, moving to 826, which is ADVATE in a PSA technology, and then leapfrogging maybe those technology with potentially gene therapy. In gene therapy, as you know, we'll post proof of clinical concept in hemophilia B. We're going to show that data in a couple of weeks in Helsinki. But overall, we believe that we are in a position of strength to continue to grow this franchise moving forward.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Bob, just talk -- could you give us some general comments about your assessment of the progress of Gambro? I know that PD is growing high single digits, low double digits thereabouts and your guidance for renal, 4% to 5%, in '15. How does Gambro figure into that? Is it tracking as you hoped in terms of revenue growth?","Robert L. Parkinson","Yes. First of all, relative to synergies, we're tracking very much on target, okay? And so the numbers that we laid out at the outset will be achieved, both in total and the time frame attendant with that, so we're pleased with that. In terms of commercial performance, frankly, we got off to a little bit of a slow start that we've really picked up steam. I think if you look at the first half, second half comps, '14 versus '13, you saw the momentum build in the second half, and I think that's a by-product of the natural challenges of integrating organizationally and getting the alignment leadership established and so on. But I think we are very much on a pace to generate revenue growth commensurate with what we messaged at the time of the acquisition. And of course, we look forward to being able to expand dialyzer capacity in 2016 and beyond, which is going to be very helpful to meet more demand. The other thing I would say, the commercial synergy component of this, now having the full product line, gives us a lot of flexibility. I mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions about public-private partnerships and so on, managing the cost of providing access to treatment of end-stage renal disease, dialysis is a very -- that's a big ticket item on every health care budget for every country around the world, and this is an area where naturally they're going to look for collaborations and how to partner to manage that. Given our full product offering, I think we're in the best position to partner with governments to do that, as evidenced by the example I gave with the PD First program in Thailand. So I'm very pleased with the acquisition. There's always fits and starts when you do something of this size and complexity, but I'm really glad we did the deal, and it's going to be a big part of our growth going forward. Bob?","Robert J. Hombach","Yes, maybe just a clarification, Bruce. We have talked about patient double-digit patient growth in the U.S. as a result of change in reimbursement. Recall U.S. is less than 20% of global PD sales. So if we look at our guidance for 2015, kind of mid-single digits for the overall renal business. In fact, PD and the legacy Gambro business are both expected to grow in that mid single-digit range. So it's comparable.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Hamblett of Cowen.","Christopher Hamblett - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just one follow-up on hemophilia. As you kind of position gene therapy as the next major potential breakthrough for the longer competitive dynamics in that market, what do you think you'll need to show in terms of long-term durability and safety to address potential regulatory concerns there with the gene therapy? And then second, what exactly are you going to show in terms of new clinical data for BAX 335 in February? And when might the Factor VIII gene therapy be ready for the clinic? I believe you said later this year, but I wanted to make sure that was correct.","Ludwig N. Hantson","Okay. With respect to the gene therapy, as I mentioned, we'll post proof of concept on hemophilia B. So the data that we're going to present in 2 weeks from now will be individual patient data where we will be showing -- and I've shared that before, we see sustained levels of Factor VIII expression elevated versus current treatments. With respect to what is the target level, there is some data with respect to target level, depends on activity of the patient. When you're talking about patients that are active, it might be 20%-plus and yet we are able to achieve those levels with hemophilia B. Then with respect to your question on regulatory pathway, that is still a work in progress. My assumption at this moment is that for every new technology that comes into hemophilia, that it might be a little bit different than the way that we've developed ADVATE 855 because there's always going to be more questions with respect to efficacy, sustainability and long-term probability. But we'll keep you posted as soon as we got the regulatory input. And with respect to the timing of gene therapy for hemophilia A, we're planning to start our clinical program in the next year. So hemophilia B, we'll post proof of concept; hemophilia A, we're going to take the same technology into the clinic in about a year from now.","Operator","Thank you.

Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter of 2018 financial results, along with our final outlook for 2018.

Please refer to today's Press Release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will start with a brief look at our first quarter performance. Then I will share a few thoughts about our ongoing transformation in advance of our upcoming investor conference. Jay will then take a closer look at the Q1 financials and provide an update on our guidance for the rest of the year. We will close with Q&A.","Baxter kicked off 2018 with strong results, delivering solid top-line performance and maintaining the momentum we have built over the course of our business transformation. Sales in the first quarter increased 8% on a reported basis, 4% on a constant currency basis, and 3% operationally. As a reminder, first quarter operational sales adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for cyclophosphamide in the U.S., and the Claris acquisition. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $0.70 increasing 21% year-over-year. This growth reflects positive contribution of our top-line performance, continuous operational efficiency improvements, a benefit from recent change to our U.S. pension plan, and a lower tax rate.","In line with our outlook, first quarter sales were negatively affected by approximately $25 million, due to the temporary manufacturing disruption in Puerto Rico related to Hurricane Maria. As we indicated on our Q4 call, these facilities were already ramping up to pre-hurricane production levels in January. This significant milestone, coupled with the FDA's granting of regulatory discretion for temporary special importation of certain products has facilitated our return to a minimum of 100% custom allocation for all major product categories connected with our Puerto Rico operations. We'd like to recognize the critical collaboration and support of FDA in helping us address product supply and relay our continued gratitude to our customers and patients as we worked to resolve the supply challenge. At this point, we do not expect any further revenue impact due to the Hurricane Maria. In addition, we continue to identify opportunities to strengthen and optimize our global manufacturing supply network.","In the quarter, following a receipt of permanent approval from FDA, we increased shipments of large volume IV solutions from Mexico to the U.S. to address increased U.S. demand. Going forward, we will look to reallocate additional IV solutions borne from select South America manufacturing facilities into the U.S. This action will allow us to complete remediation activities and modernize production processes at a certain manufacturing facilities in U.S. and Puerto Rico. The reallocation of this volume will help us ensure that we have appropriate supply levels to service both existing and new customers in the U.S. market during the period of remediation and modernization and beyond.","Innovation is essential to our growth equation and, as our Q1 highlights reflect, we're focused on driving growth both organically and inorganically for optimal impact. Last month, we completed our acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK from Mallinckrodt, bringing additional depth to our advanced surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants. These two products are already enhancing our portfolio by offering surgeons additional Baxter options when intraoperative bleeding may occur.","In addition, our advanced surgery team recently began the launch of TISSEEL Prima in Europe. TISSEEL Prima is a significant enhancement of our market leading TISSEEL fibrin sealant, now offering surgeons greater speed, precision, and control during application through a fully assembled redesigned syringe. Taken together, these developments reflect our broader commitment to driving surgical innovation and the importance we place on advanced surgery as a core growth opportunity.","In Japan, our renal care team began the launch of Baxter's KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology. KAGUYA is very similar to our AMIA APG system, while also incorporating several distinct features reflecting local needs and patient demographics. Currently, nearly all of Japan's end stage renal disease patients are treated through in-center hemodialysis. And we believe KAGUYA represents an important option to facilitate more patients choosing pediatherapy as their preferred treatment choice. Early feedback has been positive. All in, our Q1 results and efforts we've made to strengthen both our innovation pipeline and our manufacturing operations reflect the swift, steady progress we have made on Baxter's strategic transformation. We remain focused on our mission to save and sustain lives. And on our top quartile performance goals.","At the same time, our objective is to accelerate growth by extending Baxter's impact across the healthcare spectrum, supported by the evolution of our new product pipeline. We look forward to sharing more information in just a few short weeks at our upcoming investor conference, where we'll outline the next chapter in our strategy and what's in store across our businesses.","And now, I'll pass it over to Jay, who will walk you through the quarter's financial in more detail.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned we're encouraged by our first quarter results, which represented a strong start to the year. I'll start by discussing our first quarter results before providing our updated financial outlook for 2018. Beginning with the first quarter, global sales of $2.7 billion exceeded guidance increasing 8% on a reported basis, 4% at constant currency and 3% on an operational basis. Key growth drivers for the quarter included strong demand for the company's continuous renal replacement therapies, due to an intense flu season, increased sales of injectable pharmaceuticals and advanced surgery products, as well as IV solutions and peritoneal dialysis therapies.","As previously mentioned, disruptions to our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility negatively impacted first quarter sales by approximately $25 million. And as Joe mentioned, we do not expect any further impact to revenue moving forward. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 21% to $0.70 per diluted share. This exceeded our previous guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share, driven largely by operational performance and a lower than expected tax rate, due to certain discrete items we recognized during the quarter.","Now, I'll walk you through performance by our new regions and global business units. Note for this quarter, constant currency sales growth is equal to operational sales growth for all businesses with the exception of our Pharmaceuticals business. For this business, we will provide operational growth, adjusting for the impact of generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide and the Claris acquisition.","Starting first with sales growth for our three regions. Sales in the Americas advanced 4% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 3% constant currency and 2% operationally. And finally, sales in our Asia-Pacific region rose 3% on both a constant currency and operational basis.","Moving on to performance by global business units. Global sales for Renal Care were $868 million, advancing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance was driven by solid global growth in both our PD and HD businesses. Sales in Medication Delivery were $676 million, flat on a constant currency basis. Performance was driven by continued strength for U.S. large-volume IV solutions as we were able to clear a number of backorders in the quarter, given the additional volume from Mexico. Growth in the quarter was offset by lower sales internationally and the impact from Hurricane Maria.","Pharmaceuticals sales were $496 million, increasing 13% constant currency and 6% operationally. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by strength in our U.S. injectables business, which benefited from increased sales of BREVIBLOC due to competitive supply constraints. Strength in our international hospital pharmacy compounding business also contributed to growth in the quarter. Performance was partially offset by the benefit we would recognize last year for Transderm Scop as well as the impact of Hurricane Maria. Sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide were $42 million in the quarter and Claris contributed $36 million globally.","Moving to nutrition, total sales were $223 million, flat to prior year. Growth in international markets was offset by the impact of Hurricane Maria on U.S. sales. Sales in Advanced Surgery were $182 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in this business continues to improve with sales for our core hemostats and sealants advancing 6% in the quarter. As mentioned previously, we completed the acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK late in the quarter. Sales in the quarter were immaterial for these products.","Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $129 million, representing growth of 14% on a constant currency basis. Contributing to growth in the quarter was strength in global demand for Baxter's CRRT therapies as well as a benefit from an intense flu season, which contributed approximately 7 points of growth in the quarter. Finally, sales in our other category, which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services, declined 12% to $103 million on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was impacted by the timing of certain items compared to the prior-year period.","Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 43.8% declined 60 basis points over the prior year. Underlying operational expansion of more than 100 basis points was more than offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange, the impact from lost sales due to Hurricane Maria, and incremental supply chain costs we absorbed during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $587 million, increasing 6% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis. The positive contribution from our relentless focus on effectively managing our expense base was offset by lower transition service agreement income from Shire and increased freight expense as we work to ensure adequate product availability to meet our customer needs. The acquisition of Claris also added 1 point of SG&A growth in the quarter.","Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $137 million increased 6% on a reported basis and was flat on a constant currency basis for the prior-year period. R&D expenses in the quarter were impacted by the timing of certain project-related spend, which is expected to pick up in the second quarter of 2018.","Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.7%, a decline of 10 basis points versus the prior year. Strong operational expansion of approximately 300 basis points in the quarter was more than offset by the loss of transition service income, foreign exchange, and the impact of Hurricane Maria on lost sales and increased supply chain expenses. Net interest expense was $12 million in the first quarter. Adjusted other income totaled $18 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting foreign exchange gains on balance sheet positions and a benefit from the recent changes we made to our U.S. pension plan. These changes to our U.S. pension plan included separating out the current plan into two plans for active and nonactive employees, as well as announcing a prospective freeze for the active plan effective December 2022. The benefits of these changes is primarily recognized in other income due to the adoption of new accounting guidance which requires the recognition of service costs for active employees in operating income and all other components of pension expense in other income. Previously, all of pension expense was reported as part of operating expenses. Results for 2017 have been restated to reflect the change.","The adjusted tax rate was 14.5% for the quarter, which reflected a benefit of $13 million from FAS 123-R stock compensation guidance as well as certain discrete items we recognized in the quarter that favorably impacted the rate. And, as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share, driven by operational performance and a lower tax rate. During the first quarter, we repurchased $522 million, or 7.7 million shares. These repurchases were somewhat offset by option-related dilution in the quarter.","Before turning to our 2018 outlook, I will provide some commentary regarding our cash flow performance. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $292 million, an improvement of approximately $210 million versus the prior year. Growth was driven by underlying operational performance along with continued focus on improving the company's working capital performance, most notably in our days payable. In addition, cash flows during the quarter benefited from a $70 million payment for the settlement of certain claims related to the acquired operations of Claris.","Let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2018. Globally, we now expect 2018 full-year sales to increase between 7% to 8% on a reported basis, approximately 5% on a constant currency basis, and between 4% and 5% on an operational basis. Operational growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange, sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide, sales from the first seven months of Claris, and sales of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK.","Moving to guidance by business, on a constant currency and operational basis, except where otherwise noted, in Renal Care we continue to expect growth of 3% to 4%. In Medication Delivery, we now expect sales to increase 7% to 8%. We now expect our Pharmaceuticals business to increase 1% to 2% constant currency. This assumes 2018 U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of $120 million versus previous guidance of $95 million. We expect sales of Claris to contribute approximately $145 million. Excluding the impact of these sales, operational growth is expected to increase approximately 1%.","Moving to Nutrition, we continue to expect sales growth of 4% to 5%. For our Advanced Surgery business, we expect sales to increase 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis. This includes a contribution of approximately $40 million related to the recent acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK. Excluding the impact of these sales, operational growth is expected to be 3% to 4%. For the Acute Therapies business, we now anticipate growth of 9% to 10%, given the strong first quarter performance. Finally, in our other business we continue to expect low-single digit declines in sales.","Moving down the P&L, we continue to anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 to 100 basis points. We expect net interest expense of approximately $65 million and an adjusted other income between $55 million and $75 million for 2018. For the year, we now expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 19%. The tax rate reflects the lower rate we reported during the first quarter. For full-year 2018, we anticipate a diluted average share count of approximately 550 million shares. This reflects the benefit of ongoing share repurchases. Based on these factors, we expect 2018 adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $2.85 to $2.93 per diluted share. Finally, for the year, we now expect to generate operating cash flow of more than $2.2 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, and free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion.","Specific to the second quarter of 2018, we expect sales growth of approximately 9% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. Operationally, sales in the second quarter are expected to increase 3% to 4%. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.69 to $0.71 per diluted share. With that, we can open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Varun Kuchibhatla - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. This is Varun on for David. I just had a quick question on second quarter guidance. Just kind of walking through, so you did 3% in the first quarter and your guidance is maybe 3% to 4% operational ex-cyclo for the second quarter. Just given the easier comp and maybe the hurricane gives you one point and you've got Transderm as well; maybe that's another point. Just wanted to understand if there's maybe something that we're missing that kind of leaves the growth rate next quarter at only 3% to 4%. Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","No, certainly, look, as we look at the growth rate moving into the balance of the year, it's largely consistent with what we've said in the past. For us, as we look at the second quarter, there was about a point of impact related to the hurricane that we saw in the first quarter. So, you could adjust for that to see a growth rate more along the lines of 4% and like as we said, the balance of the new products' impact as we look at 2018, will come in the second half of the year. So, one of the reasons why we've been able to guide to 4% previously and now 4% to 5% relates to the benefits of the new products that we'll be launching this year. But a lot of that impact, as I say, comes in the second half of the year, through things like KAGUYA along with the version nine of the SPECTRUM pump. So, really that's what drives the acceleration in the back half of the year relative to Q2.","Varun Kuchibhatla - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a really strong quarter here. So Jay, maybe one starting on the guidance on \u2013 I just wanted to understand if the organic core was raised by 100 basis points because we had the Mallinckrodt deal close. When I look at your acquisition contribution, it really didn't change. So I'm just trying to understand what's the core operational increase for the year.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, just to give you a little background on the core operational growth of 4% to 5%, there are three items that that excludes. First, it excludes 70 basis points of Claris. So, basically seven months of Claris sales are excluded from the operational sales growth.","The second item that it excludes is the cyclo impact, which on a year-over-year basis, we now expect to be around 70 basis points. And finally, the Mallinckrodt acquisition is also excluded from operational growth. And that's about 40 basis points of impact. So that's the drivers of the difference between constant currency growth and operational growth. Really, the primary reason why we've raised operational growth from the 4% to 5% was the solid Q1 performance, and we expect that to kind of hold throughout the rest of the year. That was really the driver that led to the increase.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","No, that's helpful, Jay. And then one on margins, maybe. I think you mentioned FX and hurricane in Q1. When we think about that back half, right, and again, I think if I recall the comments you made on the prior call, pension was supposed to be a headwind. And given now it looks like cyclo's coming in better; pension was actually positive in the Q, I'm just curious on the EPS guidance and margin assumptions, given the Q1 strength we've seen.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, we did see a little bit of overperformance relative to our Q1 margin, so, definitely pleased with that performance. I would tell you that pension is in line with our expectations and really, because of the accounting change in relation to how we think about the different components of pension, most of the benefit that we're seeing year-over-year takes place in other income or below the operating margin line. It's our expectation that Q1 will roughly be the lowest margin of the year. The 16.7% will be lower than what we'll expect to see in the balance of the year. We have a lot of, a number of good elements coming through in the back three quarters, in particular, no hurricane impact. Furthermore, we'll start to see the impact of some new product launches, as I mentioned earlier, but the big headwind that we have relates to cyclophosphamide in the latter part of the year because we are still anticipating a decline in that, which will impact margins a little bit. Having said that, like I say, we do expect a bit of a step-up from Q1 levels to the balance of the year.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","And maybe if I can squeeze one in for Joe. Joe, just on cap deployment, any thoughts, updated thoughts on how you guys are thinking about the cap deployment front?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Vijay, it hasn't changed. We are very focused on three things. We continue to look to deploy cap rate dividends; share buyback, I think we've been very outspoken about that. And M&A. If we don't find the right M&As and we accumulate cash in our balance sheet, we'll buy share back. And our plan is always to continue to increase our dividend year-over-year. So, our capital plan is preset and unchanged from that point of view.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Thank you, guys.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, and congratulations on a good quarter.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Robbie.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jay, maybe I could start. You raised EPS guidance well above what you beat in the first quarter. Maybe you could give us a different breakdown of the different buckets of where it's coming from over the balance of the year.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Great. And Robbie, congratulations on your new assignment there. Overall, the EPS guidance was raised, the midpoint was raised roughly $0.13. Of that, $0.09 of it relates to Q1 overperformance. And from our expectation, the $0.09 breaks down roughly $0.06 of operational performance, and there are a number of components of that where we saw strength, and then about $0.03 of financial, and that includes positive things like the tax rate, share count and a number of other items included in that. So that's really the Q1 overperformance. Looking to the balance of the year, the two primary changes that we made to the guidance relate to cyclophosphamide. We've added roughly $25 million of cyclo, which is around $0.03, and then we also have adjusted our bottom line to reflect the contribution of Mallinckrodt, which we expect to be approximately $0.01 positive. So, on balance, it's a roughly $0.13 raise. We've seen $0.09; we've got another $0.04 to go.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And maybe just to follow up. The two businesses that stand out most to me in the quarter are Renal Care and Pharmaceuticals. These are businesses that are experiencing different growth rates than what we'd seen in the past. So maybe you could just give us some pointers of what happened in the quarter and how sustainable this is going forward. Thanks.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Robbie, let's start with Renal Care. I think the change from last year to this year which we feel confident is propelling momentum, we have a new agreement with DaVita in the U.S. that has been positive for the company. I think with DaVita undertaking this large and vast market of potential PD patients, and I think for the patient, both companies are engaged in advancing that modality. And I think, now with the lawsuit and the issues behind us, I think what we see now is the true growth of the market and the potential that we can achieve together.","The second one is the Pharmaceutical business. I think what you see there is a lack of competition for cyclophosphamide. That's one thing. I think, if you look at the performance of Claris, that's coming slightly better than we thought. And we continue to plan to launch the molecules that we had planned in the past.","So, another item that we'd like to comment is BREVIBLOC. BREVIBLOC is a drug that now has competition in the marketplace. However, we secured a customer base that continues to provide us with the business. And this has to do with a competitor who should be in the market and was not. Coming later on the year and we think if they don't come, we'll let you know. Now, if they continue to have problems, BREVIBLOC will continue to grow. If they come as we plan, which is in the guidance, actually, we'll also experience that competition. So, the Pharmaceutical business is strong despite the fact that BREVIBLOC has a competitor and it will continue to do well.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And do you guys mind just clarifying what your timelines in guidance are for cyclo competition and for BREVIBLOC? Thanks a lot.","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","Sure, Robbie. It's Clare. With respect to BREVIBLOC, we do expect incremental competition starting in this quarter, in the second quarter. For cyclophosphamide, we're assuming the similar run rate in Q2 as we had in Q1, with competition entering in the second half of the year.","Operator","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Robbie.","Operator","And our next question comes from Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys, thank you. Could you give us a little bit of detail on your expectations for gross margin progression for the rest of the year? Appreciate the comments on what went on this quarter. Kind of curious, as those roll off, how the impact of new products can kind of help sort of the gross margin tailwind? And just net of those two factors, what you guys expect as we exit the year on the gross margin level?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, overall, we've seen strong performance from our manufacturing team. Over the course of the last several quarters, all of last year, as well. And that has paid off in part in our ability to raise gross margin guidance. In the quarter, we did have some negative FX impact. We also had the impact of certain supply chain expenses. As we look to alleviate and address some of the tight supply situation we were seeing across a number of our product lines in part related to the hurricane, in part related to the intense flu season, there was a lot of incremental freight that we experienced that impacted our gross margin. So, looking at gross margin, I would say that Q1 should be the lowest quarter of the year, despite the fact that we will see cyclo erosion in the back half of the year. So, we had a 43.8 roughly number. We do expect that to go up in Q2 and Q3 which will be the highest levels of the year and then it will be down a little bit relative to Q2 Q3 levels in the fourth quarter. As I said, as the most intense period of cyclo competition emerges. And so, on balance, like I say, we'll expect roughly flat to last year, recognizing that Q1 is below the full year level from last year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, are there any implications to the cadence of tax rate for the rest of the year, based on those moving parts? Just curious if the quarter-to-quarter tax rate could see some volatility as well. Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Certainly. The tax rate, we were pleased with a number of items. Obviously on the FAS 123R is just an element that happens each quarter. But there were a couple of settlements that impacted our tax rate in the first quarter of the year. We are not expecting or banking on those kinds of settlements moving forward. So, we do expect the full-year rate to be in line with what I mentioned on the call, better than the original guidance, but in line with what I mentioned earlier in my statements. And the result of that is there is a fairly significant step up from Q2 to Q4 related to tax. And so, we'll expect to see that in line with our expectations and like I say, we're not banking on significant items to occur in the balance of the year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. You line is now open.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a great start to the year. Jay or Joe, just wanted to \u2013 not trying to front run the analyst meeting. So just want to focus on the back half of the year. And you mentioned operational sales growth acceleration from a slew of new products. Wondering if you could give us a little bit more color or remind us what some of those products are and in what businesses and how meaningful they could impact sales growth re-acceleration in said businesses.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, certainly. And Danielle, it's important to point out that while new products will play an important role in the back of the year, we also do benefit from an easy comp in fourth quarter in particular related to hurricane. So, I think that's one element to point out. But looking at \u2013 and we're very excited about the innovation pipeline. We'll be sharing a lot of detail with all of you at our Investor Day on May 21. Related to the back half of the year, I think really the two most prominent launches and the two most important, as we think about our long-term expectations for the company, relate to the version nine of the SIGMA SPECTRUM pump. This has an important innovation with respect to auto-programming, two-way wireless connectivity. So we think it's an important new feature that we added to the pump. And it's one that we're quite excited about. So that should drive some solid infusion systems growth in the back half of the year.","The second piece relates to KAGUYA. This is our cycler in Japan. And for us, this is a great step forward from a technology standpoint for Japan. It includes our SHARESOURCE technology. And we look forward to continued, or growth in that market for the foreseeable future. And that becomes an important long-term item for us. I would say those are the two most prominent. But beyond that, there are a number of smaller launches along with geographic expansion that also feature in the second half numbers.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And one follow-up on the gross margin line of questioning. We're hearing a lot out of this earnings season rising commodity prices and could this be peak margins? I mean, obviously, you guys have a lot of fat to trim elsewhere, outside of the supply chain. But how are you guys thinking about the rising commodity prices and impact to gross margin and where do you see offsets to that? Thanks so much.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Certainly. Overall, gross margins for the quarter were largely in line with our expectations. All of the impacts \u2013 again, we did not see a significant variance from what we expected. The biggest item that was a negative related to this freight. But that was not actually freight pricing; rather volumes of expedited freight related to addressing customer shipments. Certainly, this is a real area of focus for us, but our supply chain team, our purchasing team, along with our manufacturing team are incredibly focused on offsetting whatever impacts we see in raw material prices, like resin or oil, with hard savings dollars in other areas to keep us at or better than our budgeted expectations. Part of the reason why we did so well in Q1, along with things moving forward relates to strong performance from our manufacturing and supply chain team. We expect that to continue and we expect to work to offset these cost changes for input materials to continue.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, thank you. This is actually Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Congrats on the great quarter.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","My first question is on a little more color on KAGUYA. How do you guys see the PD market opportunity in Japan? And is there any numbers that you guys could provide?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Hi, good morning. We feel that the market is very under penetrated. To date, there's only 3% of the population eligible for dialysis that isn't peritoneal dialysis. And one of the biggest impediments was the fear of peritonitis and contamination. What KAGUYA does, it has automatic assembly of the connecting tubes in the catheter. So is hands free. This device, we just got reports that we are really doing extremely well in our pre-launch efforts in Japan. It looks like it's taking off. So, the market in Japan is a highly profitable market, but was also under penetrated. So, with this launch, we hope that we can unlock the market by providing technology that puts at ease the fear of contamination and peritonitis. So, it's a milestone launch for Baxter.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Oh no, that's very helpful. Thank you very much. And then my follow-up question is kind of going back to capital allocation. You guys have talked about acquisitions being an important factor for revenue growth going forward into 2020 and beyond. But you also don't like to have the large transformational acquisitions. Is there any commentary that you guys can give us on the Goldilocks kind of size of an acquisition that gives you that revenue growth without being too large?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","I like it term Goldilocks. So, thinking about what -- I kind of pictured that right away instead of the acquisitions we have in mind. We don't put the size as much as what are the adjacencies to our business that lend themselves for acquisitions, okay? We are not pursuing white space acquisitions, meaning large acquisitions that have very little synergistic value for the company. But we are pursuing acquisitions, anything from $50 million to $3 billion, $4 billion, okay? So that's the space that we can play. We have the balance sheet to do so. But as I say all the time, it's all about the return, the returns, our ability to integrate successfully, preserve the culture. All the good things that I think we have done with Claris, for instance. Mallinckrodt was a small acquisition, but an integration similar. So, it's gone extremely well. So, we are pursuing very hard acquisitions. We have a very good team in place. So, the sizes are not what guides us, but the opportunity to really create value for our shareholders.","As I said, double digit internal rate of return, 500, 600 basis points better than our cost of cap including debt. Cost of debt, I say about having an ROIC, the three to five years gets the company average. And we've been doing a good job with returning investor cap and return on assets. Company has done a good job in creating momentum on those two indexes. And more so create long-term growth that is in markets that are equal or better what Baxter currently competes on. So, I would say that, stay tuned. But if we don't find those acquisitions for whatever reason, they don't pan out, we have the balance sheet at our disposal to continue to buy aggressively shares back.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's very helpful and congrats on a great quarter again.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Hey, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, this is John Hsu on for Larry. Joe, maybe if we could start just following up on your comments on M&A. That was obviously very helpful. But regarding no white spaces, one thing that we saw recently is you obviously closed the acquisition of those Mallinckrodt assets, which I believe gives you a new leg in the basic side of the BioSurgery market. And you obviously have leading share on the advanced BioSurgery side. So, does your future M&A contemplate opportunities to build out on the basic side? And if so, could you help us kind of size what that opportunity looks like?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","You're talking about building on the Advanced Surgery side? Okay. So, we do find ourselves with several opportunities. We still need to create a global portfolio that is more uniform, okay? So, we're doing that through organic opportunities. So, we have an active \u2013 several new products being developed. But we still have need to accelerate entering the market in some geographies for some products. So, you're going to continue to see an active pursue from Baxter in populating each portfolio across the globe. So we can have similar offerings, even if there's regional only, that will fulfill the whole gamut of hemostat and sealants that go, like you said, from your basic hemostat all to more complex variations of flow seal. And that allows us to provide the physicians with what they need to stop the bleeding and heal the patient.","John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great, that's really helpful. And then for the follow-up, how do we think about the flu impact in the 1Q, or kind of the one-time benefit there?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, the primary area where the flu impacted was our Acute business, where we did see outstanding growth. And what I will tell you is the remainder of our business, we did not see a significant change to our core hospital products business as a result of the flu, in large part because of some of the supply constraints that we had in place, but related to the Acute business it was roughly...","Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.","It was about $8 million of a benefit in the quarter, $7 million to $8 million of a benefit in the U.S. from the flu in our Acute business.","John Hsu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Clare. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh great, thank you. Just have two quick questions. First, on the medical delivery side, just curious if you can give us an update on Mexico and bringing incremental supply to the U.S.? And is that the reason why things get better in the back half, because you just have more capacity?","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah. Certainly, we do expect to see incremental volumes in the back part of the year, but there was also a hurricane impact in our Medication Delivery business in the U.S. in the first quarter north of $10 million. So that was a key driver that we expect to subside in Q2 to Q4.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Yeah, Bob, also now thinking about it strategically, how we provide product for the U.S. business. The U.S. market needs permanent volume increase from Baxter. So, we decided to supplement our volumes of large volume parenterals, which are the bags that go from 250 mL to 1 liter, with 100 million units coming from Mexico on a permanent basis.","So what this does for us is threefold. First of all, it eases the fear of us ever getting into a situation where the company has been in the last few years where we had struggled with allocations and things of this sort. Second, allows us to go in and pursue new customers. And thirdly, and as important as the other two is the fact that we can have time to modernize and remediate our facilities in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.","So, having this change in how we allocated volumes across the globe is very important. What people sometimes don't remember is Baxter is a global company with the ability to make products in many countries of the world to supply any geography that we need. And unfortunately, we had different thinking some time ago where we restrict ourselves to geographies. Not anymore. We have the ability to shift products from Brazil into the U.S., from Colombia into the U.S., from Castlebar in Ireland into the U.S., and vice-versa. And we also monitor volumes and demand across the globe. So, this is a new company that will be there for our patients and customers as they need our solutions.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific, thank you. Thank you for that. Very helpful. And then, Joe just wanted to ask one sort of big picture question on the upcoming Analyst Day. Maybe just broadly speaking, how confident are you that there's an organic kind of new product portfolio pipeline at Baxter that can lead to better revenue growth going forward?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Bob, I feel very confident. If I have to put this in baseball terms, and I hope all our audience today understand a little bit of baseball, but I would say that we are at the top of the third inning when it comes to innovation. So, while we have set up ourselves well that we have the right research and development team in place right now, we have the right structure in place, and we have really solid strategies by global business unit today. So if I look at the pipeline, every business of ours has a ten-year pipeline. We have technology development teams in place, we have associating ourselves with universities as the case of our center for the metric hydration you guys going to see in May. That has a lot to do with the collaboration between Vanderbilt University and Baxter.","So, I feel the company has turned a corner in how it learns to innovate. And when I say we're at the top of the third inning because there's a bright future ahead of us and I think we have now the ability to accelerate, combined with the fact that we're leading out the organization with an SG&A now sub 22%, so we can now not only deliver the profitability to our investors, but also fund some of the innovation that is very needed.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","James K. Saccaro - Baxter International, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Larry Wong (51:18) of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, it's Lee (51:23) calling in for Larry. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to start with just a question on the SUPRANE. There was a generic FDA approval couple of months ago, but it doesn't look like it's launched. Can you just talk through how you think about the generic risk? I understand it's not easy to get a generic product in the marketplace, and how you think about the generic risk in your 2018 guidance. And then I have a follow up.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We have no impact of this generic SUPRANE in the marketplace and the impact that we have in 2018 is none, is nil. So our conclusion goes along with what you just said. It's not an easy product to penetrate the marketplace and we don't think that, at the moment in time, there's any threat to our 2018 numbers. Neither we have seen anything that concerns us.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, so in your Analyst Day you plan to give an update, I think, on your 2020 outlook and provide longer term guidance beyond 2020. We have some aspect of your 2020 outlook from prior calls and prior Analyst Day. Would you say you're confident at this point that you would be able to overachieve your 2020 outlook at this point, just based on everything you've done through 1Q 2018?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","This is like getting a preview of a movie that has now gone to the theaters, in the Internet, when somebody filmed that illegally in the movie theater. I'm not giving you that one. Wait for it. It's not too far in the future. It's three and a half weeks, we'll be very happy to give you that insight when we are all in New York at the Sierra Hotel.","Unknown Speaker","All right, understood. And if I squeeze one more in, is there any update on the Claris 483?","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","We have complete all the items that we have committed to the FDA that we're going to complete on time. We submitted that to the FDA. We can't speak on behalf of the FDA. But we can speak on behalf of Baxter that we have done everything that we've promised to do. And we continue to do because that's not an end game. You don't just do what the FDA asks you to. We continue to improve, find opportunities to improve our operation (54:10), and from our estimation, our plant has improved significantly. But we're not the FDA, as I said, and I cannot comment on their behalf. But we at Baxter continue to be satisfied with the level of improvement that we have seen at our facility.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks very much.","Jos\u00e9 E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Ludwig Hantson, President, BioScience; and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.","As previously announced Bob Hombach will be transitioning into his new role as Chief Financial and Operations Officer for Baxalta Incorporated upon completion of the Baxalta spin and Jay Saccaro, who is also with us today will be assuming the role of Chief Financial Officer for Baxter International.","On the call this morning, we'll be discussing Baxter's first quarter financial results and outlook for the second quarter before taking your questions. I would like to take a moment to highlight that we'll be hosting separate investor conferences in New York City on the afternoon of May 18 for Baxter International and the morning of May 19 for Baxalta Incorporated.","At these conferences we will introduce you to the new Senior Management Teams and provide investors with more information regarding the strategies, growth prospects, capital structure and financial outlook for each company including guidance for the second half of 2015 and longer term projections. I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page of the Baxter website to register for the event.","In addition, we'll also engage in a comprehensive Investor Relations effort including Investor road shows for both companies with the respective Senior Management teams, several weeks before the spinoff is completed.","So with that, let me start our prepared remarks this morning by reminding you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Bob Parkinson","Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you all for calling in.","As you saw in the press release that was issued this morning, Baxter reported financial results for the first quarter with adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share, exceeding guidance of $0.85 to $0.90 per share.","Worldwide sales excluding currency increased 4% also exceeding guidance. We continue to successfully deliver on a wide range of strategic and operational objectives as we're extending our global reach, launching innovative and differentiated products and therapies, advancing our new product pipeline and investing to drive future growth and position the two companies for sustained success.","Our new product pipeline is focused on a number of programs that improve the quality of care and address key high potential areas of unmet medical need. Some recent highlights include CE marking in Europe for HOMECHOICE CLARIA an automated peritoneal dialysis system integrated with the SHARESOURCE web-based connectivity platform.","This system is designed with user friendly features and secure two way connectivity. So healthcare providers can monitor their patient's home PD treatments and adjust prescriptions as necessary. We expect to initiate the commercial launch of the system in select European and Asian countries beginning in the second quarter of this year.","We also received FDA approval and orphan drug designation of PHOXILLUM Renal Replacement Solutions for use in continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT, to correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances and we plan to introduce these solutions in the United States in the coming weeks.","In BioScience we submitted a new drug application to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health for the approval of BAX 855, our investigational, extended half-life recombinant factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE.","In addition, we've also completed enrollment in the BAX 855 pediatric study, which will support post-approval label expansion in the U.S. for previously treated pediatric patients and European regulatory submission in 2016.","We announced positive results from the Phase III study of BAX 817 for patients with hemophilia A or B who develop inhibitors. The trial met its endpoint of successful resolution of acute bleeding episodes with an overall success rate of 92%. No patients developed inhibitors or binding antibodies during the study and none discontinued treatment due to adverse events.","We expect to initiate regulatory submissions in the next several years aligned with the prioritization of other pipeline assets and manufacturing expansions currently underway.","Our partner CTI BioPharma announced positive top-line results from PERSIST-1, a randomized, controlled Phase III registration clinical trial examining pacritinib, a next generation oral JAK2\/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis.","The trial met its primary endpoint of reduction of spleen volume and the safety profile was consistent with previous studies. Data will be highlighted in a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in Chicago next month.","Under our collaboration with Momenta Pharmaceuticals we initiated a pharmacokinetic trial in Europe for BAX 923 a biosimilar version of HUMIRA. As you know HUMIRA is a therapy for patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","And finally, we presented interim data from the Phase I\/II study of BAX 335, an investigational factor IX gene therapy treatment for hemophilia B. The trial is assessing the safety of ascending doses of BAX 335 in up to 16 adult patients to determine the optimal single dose.","At the end of 2014, a total of six patients from three dosing cohorts had been treated, with evidence of a dose-related response. In the two highest dose cohorts, Factor IX activity levels in 10% or above were observed in two patients with no bleeding episodes. In addition, no patients developed Factor IX inhibitors. We expect to disclose additional data at the upcoming ISTH Congress in Toronto in June.","In addition to internal innovations, strategic acquisitions and partnerships remain essential for both businesses as we continue to enhance and bolster our portfolio. During the first quarter, we acquired SuppreMol, a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in Germany developing treatment options for autoimmune and allergic diseases.","The acquisition includes SuppreMol's early stage development portfolio of novel biologic immunoregulatory therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and IgE-mediated allergic diseases. The technology focuses on the modulation of FC receptors signaling pathways and immune target that could have broad applications of diseases like Lupus, a disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue.","And we signed an exclusive global licensing and distribution agreement with Laboratoire Aguettant SAS for trace elements, which are essential micronutrients used in parenteral nutrition therapy. This collaboration augment Baxter\u2019s leading parenteral nutritional portfolio and the companies will work together to pursue a broad range of regulatory approvals including United States.","In summary, our core portfolio remains strong. We continue to benefit from the focus on life saving therapies and we\u2019re pursuing new avenues to enhance the value of our products for patients in healthcare providers. Innovation is the life blood of Baxter\u2019s success and our increased investment and recent achievements point the way to even greater success in the future.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, I highlight as you know that we\u2019re quickly nearing a transformational milestone in Baxter\u2019s history with the creation of two leading healthcare companies. One focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life saving medical products.","This will present a remarkable opportunity for growth and success in two new companies with unique and compelling investment identities prospects and strategies while each continues to extend their legacy of pioneering science and enhancing shareholder value.","Our employees around the world have been fully engaged in separation activity since the announcement last March. And we remain on track toward a mid-2015 completion as a result of their dedication and commitment. And while the separation will occur during a period of transitions our passion for saving and sustaining lives will be enduring.","As always I\u2019ll be happy to take any questions on this or other topics during the Q&A. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Bob Hombach for discussion of our first quarter financial results and outlook. Bob?","Bob Hombach","Thanks Bob, and good morning, everyone.","Adjusted earnings in the first quarter of $1 per diluted share exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per share. These results included $74 million of unplanned other income or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily associated with the impact of foreign currency and balance sheet positions.","As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.78 per diluted share included net after tax special items totaling $120 million or $0.22 per diluted share primarily for intangible asset amortization and cost associated with the company\u2019s plan separation and the integration of its Gambro AB acquisition. These charges were partially offset by a benefit related to the reversal of certain business optimization reserves.","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for the second quarter of 2015.","Starting with sales. Worldwide sales of approximately $3.8 billion declined 2% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4% which favorably compares to our guidance for the quarter of 2 to 3%.","Medical Product sales were in line with our expectations, while strong growth across the BioScience portfolio contributed to the over achievement.","Sales in the U.S. increased 4% and international sales on a constant currency basis increased 5%. Emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver across the Medical Products and BioScience portfolios as evidenced by mid-teens growth in the BRIC markets during the first quarter.","In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales totaled approximately 1.4 billion in the quarter and increased 2% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, BioScience sales advanced by more than 8% comparable to the full year growth generated last year with continued positive momentum across the portfolio.","Our hematology business which includes hemophilia and inhibitor therapies generated global sales of $807 million, which declined 2% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, hematology sales grew 5%. Within the hematology product categories, hemophilia sales in the first quarter of $641 million declined 5% on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis, global sales increased 2%.","Strong global demand for recombinant therapies including ADVATE and RIXUBIS was offset by the impact related to our reimbursement assistance program which was recently implemented for patients in the U.S. and the timing of tender sales in Eastern Europe. Excluding these impacts, hemophilia sales in the quarter increased 6%.","In the U.S., sales in the hemophilia category were up 5% after adjusting for the impact of new reimbursement program. We continue to be pleased with the overall growth of recombinant factor A therapies despite the competitive environment and modest patient losses. We continue to estimate our cumulative recombinant factor A share loss at approximately 2%.","Sales in the inhibitor category which includes FEIBA and OBIZUR of $166 million advanced 9% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inhibitor sales advanced 18%. This was primarily driven by demand and price improvements for FEIBA as we continue to promote a prophylaxis indication and a modest contribution from the recent launch of OBIZUR for patients with acquired hemophilia.","You may recall only 15% to 20% of inhibitor patients globally are treated prophylactically presenting a significant long term growth opportunity for a hematology business.","Turning to the immunology business, which includes immunoglobulin therapies such as HYQVIA and GAMMAGARD LIQUID as well as biotherapeutics, sales totaled $554 million in advanced 10% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, immunology sales grew 14% versus the prior year.","Immunoglobulin sales of $420 million increased 6% on a reported basis or 9% on a constant currency basis. This was a result of robust demand particularly in chronic primary immunodeficiency market, strong international growth driven by our improved supply and the contribution of HYQVIA.","As you may recall, we launched HYQVIA in the U.S. during the fourth quarter last year. This is a transformational therapy within attractive value proposition for patients, physicians and payers. We are very pleased with the uptick and continue to experience a favorable reception in the U.S. marketplace based on its differentiation. Of the 15,000 adult PI subQ patients, we now have approximately 1,500 patients on HYQVIA with majority converting from competitive therapies.","Lastly, in the biotherapeutics category which primarily includes albumin and our alpha-1 therapies, we recorded sales of $134 million which increased 29% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 36% driven by an easier comparison to last year favorable pricing and increased demand for albumin particularly in China.","In Medical Products, global sales were approximately $2.4 billion declined 5% and on a constant currency basis sales increased 2%. Adjusting both periods for the impact of new generic competition in the U.S. for cyclophosphamide, Medical Product sales rose 4% on a constant currency basis.","Within the product categories renal sales totaled $913 million reflecting a decline of 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis sales increased 1%.","PD growth of mid to high single digits which was driven primarily by solid PD patient gains in Asia was offset by the selective loss of certain lower margin HD monitor and dialyzer sale along with our objective of optimizing margins.","Within the fluid systems category, sales of $493 million declining 2% and on a constant currency basis sales grew 3%. Performances driven by favorable pricing and demand for IV therapies and infusion systems in the U.S.","Sales in the integrated pharmacy solutions business totaled $564 million and declined 5%. On a constant currency basis sales increased 1% as strong growth of nutritional therapies and compounding services revenues were offset by lower cyclophosphamide sales in the U.S. Excluding this impact, sales in the category advanced 10%.","A new competitor entered the U.S. market for cyclophosphamide during the fourth quarter last year and we continue to expect additional competitors. As a reference, full year 2014 U.S. cyclophosphamide sales totaled approximately $450 million and sales in the first quarter of 2015 totaled approximately $60 million.","Revenues in surgical care which includes our inhaled anesthetics in BioSurgery products were $322 million in the quarter and comparable to last year. Sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis as double digit growth in anesthesia reflecting increased global penetration with someone offset by lower sales of select BioSurgery products.","Finally, sales in the BioPharma Solutions and other category, which is our former partnering business, totaled $111 million increasing 1% on a reported basis or 6% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributive primarily to increased demand from our contract manufacturing partners.","Turning to the rest of P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 49% compared to 50.4% last year. Positive mix, select pricing improvements and foreign currency hedge gains were more than offset by the expected cyclophosphamide and manufacturing impacts.","SG&A totaled $887 million and declined 1%. On a constant currency basis, SG&A increased 6%. This growth reflects bad debt expense driven by adjustments in several emerging markets and BioScience\u2019s investments to support international operations and marketing initiatives related to new product launches.","R&D spending in the quarter of $298 million increased 7% driven primarily by an increasing in BioScience which was offset by foreign currency. In BioScience, we continue to invest in various programs across the disease areas of hematology, immunology and oncology while advancing technology platforms such as gene therapy and biosimilars.","Interest expense was $30 million in the first quarter compared to $43 million last year as we benefitted from recent debt maturities, higher capitalized interest and income generated from the change in the mix of floating versus fixed interest rates.","Other income totaled $74 million and -- including gains related to the impact of foreign currency on balance sheet positions driven by the significant decline in the Euro during the quarter. The tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter in line with our expectations and as previously mentioned adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our full year sales guidance and outlook for the second quarter. Beginning with the new Baxter franchises, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect sales for the full year 2015 to be comparable to 2014, primarily due to the impact of generics cyclophosphamide. Excluding cyclophosphamide in both years, underlying growth would be approximately 3%.","We now expect sales in our renal franchise to grow approximately 3%. This is somewhat lower than our original expectations as we remain committed to servicing our patients while all folks focusing on enhancing profitability. As such, we made proactive decision to forgo lower margin sales opportunities.","For fluid systems, we continue to expect sales to grow in the 2 to 3% range. We continue to expect sales of our surgical care franchise to grow in the 4 to 5% range. We now expect the integrated pharmacy solutions, sales to decline high single digits. This category includes cyclophosphamide and the impact of generic competition.","For 2015, we estimate U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of approximately $150 million and growth for the category after adjusting for cyclo is expected to be in mid-single digits. And finally, we expect the other category to decline approximately 15% which will be impacted by major customer electing to self-manufacture products previously manufactured by Baxter.","For Baxalta, we now project sales growth on a constant currency basis of approximately 4%. Our outlook includes growth in the hemophilia franchise of 0% to 2% which will be fueled by new product launches and strong international demand which will be somewhat offset by anticipated high single digit share loss for a recombinant factor A therapies in the U.S. due to competition.","We now expect growth in the inhibitors category to exceed 8% driven by strong performance in the first quarter further penetration in growth of FEIBA for the treatment of inhibitors and the launch of OBIZUR of acquired hemophilia patients.","For immunoglobulin therapies, we continue to expect growth of 6% to 8% driven by strong market demand and contribution from HYQVIA.","And finally for BioTherapeutics which includes plasma based therapies like albumin and treatments for alpha-1 deficiencies, we continue to expect growth in the 2% to 4% range.","As we previously highlighted, given the complexities of a mid-year spend, we are not in a position today to provide full year P&L guidance for Baxter and Baxalta. We are however, providing guidance for the second quarter as Baxter will be publishing earnings result for the combined business at the end of July.","As stated in our press release for the combined business, we expect adjusted earnings excluding special items of $0.92 to $0.96 per diluted share. This guidance does not reflect any material incremental standup cost for the separation as expenses will begin to be layered in toward the end of the quarter.","Our outlook by P&L line item, we expect second quarter sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase approximately 1%. At current foreign exchange rates we expect reported sales to decline 9% to 10%. By business on a constant currency basis we expect medical product sales to be comparable to last year and BioScience sales to grow approximately 4%.","We expect the gross margin for the company to decline by more than 150 basis points versus the second quarter margin last year of 50.3%. We expect SG&A to decline in high single digits and R&D to decline in mid single digits. On a constant currency basis SG&A growth is expected to be in low single digits and R&D growth is expected to be in mid to high single digits.","And finally for the second quarter, we expect interest expense to total approximately $35 million and other income of approximately $50 million. This does not include any impact of foreign currency on balance sheet positions as our outlook assumes current foreign exchange rates remain constant.","We expect a tax rate of approximately 22% and an average share count of approximately 547 million shares.","I would like to conclude my prepared remarks this morning by saying that we recognize investors and analysts need more information to help model both companies separately. So we look forward to providing you with an overview of the businesses at our upcoming investor conferences on May 18, 2015 and May 19, 2015, in New York.","At this point, our estimate of initial incremental stand-up cost to create two independent companies remains approximately 2% of total Baxter sales or slightly more than $300 million. About half of these costs will be reflected in operating results beginning in the second half of 2015. Going forward both companies will take steps to reduce a meaningful portion of these costs over the next several years post spin.","Finally as we're finalizing the capital allocation strategies of each business, I would emphasize that both businesses will have strong balance sheets, generate significant cash flow and have flexibility to follow a disciplined capital allocation approach, which balances reinvestment in the business with returning value to shareholders.","This concludes my prepared remarks this morning. We look forward to providing more financial information to you in May.","Now, let we open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International's website for 30 days at www.baxter.com.","Our first question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen and Company. Your question please.","Josh Jennings","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first just on the renal business, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on not only the decrease in projection there for that business, but also just specifically on Gambro the performance in the quarter and the outlook going forward and then update on the cost synergies.","Bob Parkinson","Sure Josh, Bob Parkinson. I may ask Jay Saccaro to add his comments as well.","Relative to the renal performance, clearly the growth in first quarter was -- actually the business was fairly flat as we pointed out in the script, largely due conscious decision to walk away from a couple of tenders that frankly weren\u2019t generating the kind of returns that we expect.","One of the things that we've talked about before and you'll hear more about when we were in New York a few weeks is our increased focus on portfolio and particularly in areas that the returns in certain businesses in certain countries are not generating accept those kind of returns and so that was really what contributed mostly to the softness in the first quarter of the overall renal business.","Going forward we're looking at mid single digit growth for the remainder of the year that\u2019s really led by faster growth in the acute area. But overall, we're projecting about mid single digit growth as I said for the last nine months of the year.","So in some ways the first quarter was a bit of an anomaly. Relative to your question more specifically about Gambro, the decisions we made to walk away from tenders and so were in fact in the chronic space the hemodialysis space that would be associated with the Gambro business.","The PD business continues to -- underlying demand continues to be strong globally, I would say that we continue to work through the integration issues with Gambro as we face that on a global basis.","Again the numbers right now are tracking a little bit behind the model that we pull together when we did the acquisition, but we continue to be very positive about the decision to make the acquisition and the prospects of the business going forward.","Jay, you want to talk about maybe the second part of the question, Baxter question.","Jay Saccaro","Yes, I believe the second part was in relation to overall cost synergies and how that's tracking. As we think about that component, we've previously commented $300 million in annual savings achieved by 2017. As we sit here today we're confident that we're much on track in terms of achieving the milestones necessary to achieve that level of cost savings by 2017.","Bob Parkinson","Josh, one thing I would add coming back to my comments, the specific focus on Gambro, obviously one of the rationales behind the deal was to be able to bring forward a broad based product offering and in addition to the cost synergies that Jay just commented on is the opportunity for commercial synergies that we're all starting to release.","So as we move forward, really the way to value this business or evaluate the business is to look at it in total. While the chronic business was softer in the first quarter for the reasons that I mentioned, we're seeing synergies already in terms of increased demand in the PD segment as a result of being able to bring a broad product offering to the marketplace, particularly participating in certain tenders and so on where we have as I say a complete product offering.","So I think going forward the way to look at this business is really an aggregate because you're going to see the various components certainly in the chronic space where there is traditional in-center or PD in the home begin to melt together somewhat.","Josh Jennings","Great, thanks for that and just a quick follow-up. I know you're going to give more details at the Investor Day, but you have called out that the new Baxter is going to hold a 20% stake in Baxalta. Can you just give us some details around the rationale behind that strategy? Any timelines in terms of the ultimate sale of that stake and deployment of that capital, thanks a lot.","Bob Parkinson","Again we'll be more specific on that in a couple of weeks, but Bob maybe you might just want to make couple of comments about that.","Bob Hombach","Well certainly, yes. Josh, I think first and foremost this is a clear indication of confidence in the future prospects of Baxalta and I think it provides a significant amount of flexibility in terms of capital structure really for both businesses as we approach this significant separation and try to set up the two entities for sustainable success going forward.","Again very confident in the ability to generate significant cash for both and want to ensure we position both that in a very competitive environment to be ready and able to continue to pursue their strategies, which include reinvesting in the business and potentially bolt-on acquisitions as well.","And as Bob mentioned, I think we will get into much more detail on that as we get into the Investor Conference in May.","Operator","Thank you. David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question. Your question please.","David Roman","Thank you, good morning, everybody. Hey Bob.","I wanted just to start with hemophilia. I think in your prepared remarks you referenced 2% cumulative share loss for now three quarters into the Biogen launch. Are we at a point now where you feel confident in sort of your original substance about the pace of share loss and if that is the case why not a more optimistic outlook than the 0% to 2% guidance that you're providing for the balance of 2015.","Bob Parkinson","All right. I'll turn this to the expert Ludwig.","Ludwig Hantson","Well, thanks for the question David.","So as you said, we continue to see growth in our recombinant Factor VIII demands in the U.S. In addition to that, as you saw we have very strong FEIBA growth. I can tell you we have a very strong team and ADVATE has a very strong brand equity. And the bar is high and the bar is high on efficacy and tolerability.","So with respect to guidance that we gave you already last year, high single digit market share loss between the launch and the launch of ELOCTATE and the launch of 855. We still stick to that guidance for now.","The 2% market share we're doing better as expected. We're going to see what we're going to do in the next couple of quarters. You should also note that we will get additional competition within the Factor VIII space in U.S. So we will keep you posted on how we're doing and we will adjust our sales guidance accordingly.","David Roman","And if I could just clarify something just before I go to my second question. You said the high single digit share loss between ELOCTATE and 855, so I think about the total Baxter franchise, ADVATE, plus 855 the share loss will be lower than high single digits.","Bob Parkinson","Well I think the expectation is we would get approval very late in 2015 and then launch 855. So from midyear last year launch of ELOCTATE till that point at the end of this year before we launch 855 that that\u2019s the single digit share loss that we're referring to.","Ludwig Hantson","So as we think it's about in 18 months period.","David Roman","Got it. Okay. And then secondly just on margins, Bob in your comments around renal, you made the point that you did walk away from some lower margin business and I think one of the potential opportunities around the medical products is the relative profitability compared to peers.","Can you just may be give some sense on the dissynergies. How easy is it just to cut out those incremental $300 million, it sounds like you're adding the cost than in terms of pulling it back out. You have commitment to ranch it that down, but how long does something like that take and what are the steps needed to get there.","Bob Parkinson","First of all the entire $300 million is in new BAX that's partly absorbed by Baxalta as well. But nonetheless it\u2019s a meaningful number. I would say our intent would be to offset the negative impact of dissynergies and stranded costs if you will probably within a two-year timeframe, but frankly that\u2019s just part of a broader initiative to evaluate opportunity to pull out structural cost, which is a significant opportunity going forward.","This is the story that you're going to hear in a few weeks in New York is our belief strongly is that there is an opportunity to meaningfully improve margins over time whether it\u2019s the Gambro synergies that we continue to track well on as Jay commented earlier focus on structural cost improvement in manufacturing efficiencies and costs going forward because we have absorbed some incremental costs.","As you know in our facilities particularly in manufacturing IV solutions and PD solutions as a result of looking for ways to enhance our operational and quality performance in those businesses, the re-launch of CIGMA spectrum portfolio as I talked about in terms of a more proactive management of that and then increased focus on higher margin, higher growth product.","So in aggregate, this provides a very exciting opportunity to meaningfully increase margins over time, but you're right. Back to your question David, as you benchmark versus peers and so on, as you'll see we're at the lower end. Now part of that frankly to some degree is the nature of the businesses that we're in.","Not only IV solutions, but PD solutions, we incur significant distribution cost as associated would be in those businesses that typically are unique to those kinds of businesses compared to other companies you might want to benchmark again.","So in some ways the real litmus test here is in those businesses are we generating returns that are sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital. In many ways this gets back to the whole notion of focusing on portfolio. So again I'll stop there. Jay I could talk a lot of this, but you'll hear more on this in few weeks David.","Operator","Thank you. David Lewis of Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question. Please take you question.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here. Just into the second quarter Bob, the earnings was a little lower than you were expecting, but some of the factors you discussed weren\u2019t materially different than we were expecting.","So does that simple reflect conservatism or simply incremental cycle of pressure with a little bit of currency? So what is specifically driving some of the pressure sequentially?","Bob Parkinson","Well yes first and foremost, I would say the second quarter very much aligns with our outlook of the full year. So there is a calendarization impact at work here as well just in terms of timing of tenders and so on.","But clearly the cycle impact will accelerate in the second quarter relative to the first quarter fairly meaningfully as that first competitor is much more entrenched in the marketplace. And FX will continue to be a headwind as we've talked about the rate at which we've been able to hedge key currencies like the Euro or much in the first half of the year than they are in the back half of the year. So that's certainly a contributor to the near term.","But again I would emphasize this is all very much in line with our expectations as we look at 2015 initially.","David Lewis","Very, very clear. And then Ludwig just with the commentary I guess that Bob had made, but on inhibitors the volume growth is actually very impressive. The other comment that was interesting though, I think there was a comment about stronger pricing in the inhibitor segment.","I am trying to figure out where exactly that stronger pricing is coming from? Is this simply mix or are you, just given the strength of the portfolio using this as an opportunity to take up price in either these or obviously this new or FEIBA.","Ludwig Hantson","Well FEIBA is the number one driver within that segment. So we're just launching OBIZUR and the patient response is very positive on OBIZUR. So we're still building that business.","On FEIBA we see different dimensions here. The first one continued growth -- demand growth because of very strong rollout of the [profile] [ph] indication and in addition to that, we've been able to take a little bit of price on FEIBA.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just one quick one and I'll jump back in queue. For Bob Parkinson, Bob you talked about renal cost cutting and then sort of renal growth being a little slower. In terms of capacity that was a big driver of the Gambro transaction. Are we going to ramp capacity at certain plants?","Is there any concern that if growth is slower on renal, that's going to put some pressure on some of the gross margin objectives or are you still comfortable with those gross margin objectives or simply feel that there are more SG&A cost opportunities at Gambro that make you very confident that you still get to those cost targets even with a little lower growth rate. Thank you.","Bob Parkinson","Yes, well the synergies that Jay commented on earlier largely associated with structural cost and global manufacturing footprint and things of that nature -- very operational in nature. In terms of our gross margins, we're confident that we're on track with what we model in that regard.","I think clearly the -- and we modeled this in. I think the traditional in center hemo market will always be very, very price competitive and so I think we've been very realistic in how we forecasted pricing and margins going forward and that business I think the acute segment and frankly the PD segment in certain markets around the world can be more blank in terms of pricing and selling.","But net, net for the broad renal business including the Gambro component, I think our outlook in terms of pricing, market dynamics and how that manifests itself in gross margins is pretty realistic.","Jay Saccaro","Yeah and maybe just adding one comment back to the second quarter and our outlook, I would also emphasize, we had given a somewhat wider range for two reasons. One is the volatility in FX, but the second one is during the course of the second quarter, likely we will execute our financing to establish the capital structure for Baxalta and have to adjust the existing debt portfolio potentially for Baxter.","And as a result, there is some uncertainly around both timing and impact on interest expense. So we've built some conservatism into the outlook to account for that eventuality.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Kristen Stewart","Question and guess this will be our last call together as old Baxter, so I had a couple of questions just throw them out there. On the -- on the I guess the recombinant hemophilia side, you had mentioned new patient reimbursement programs.","I was wondering if you could just comment on that. Is that part of a strategy to kind of keep people locked in with ADVATE? Just wanted to get an update on the Georgia plant and how things are going? Whether or not that is tracking on schedule from a completion perspective and Sanquin and then lastly just gross margins.","You had guided to being down 250 to 300 basis points. Came in a little bit better than that. Just curious on what drove the favorability, thanks.","Ludwig Hantson","Yes, this is Ludwig. Kristen, thanks for your question. With respect to hemophilia, these new patient reimbursement programs, we do this for access reasons. Want to make sure that people have access to all products.","With respect to the Georgia plant, it is on schedule. As for supplies concerns, we will grow faster than the market including the Sanquin opportunity. You mentioned Sanquin is still on track to have the first product by the end of this year and we will be focused on European product.","Kristen Stewart","Okay.","Bob Hombach","And Kristen as it relates to gross margin yes, the gross margin did come in from a percentage base is a bit better than we expected in the quarter. That certainly is driven by mix. You saw BioScience grew very strongly.","Some modest price contribution as well as a bit than we expected, but also on a reported basis, we did have hedge gains as I mentioned and so those hedge gains while they do impact the gross margin, they\u2019re simply offsetting the underlying weakness in the currency that\u2019s driving down the natural sales and gross margins that would otherwise be reported by the business.","So the mechanics here with the lower reported sales, but the gross profit dollars being preserved by the hedges, result in a higher reported gross margin and that contributed somewhere between 60 and 70 basis points to the reported gross margin percentage benefit in the quarter.","Just maybe a moment more on those hedges, again I would emphasize that these hedge preserve value, they do not in and of themselves create incremental value. They are there to hedge underlying exposures. By definition if the currencies are weak and those underlying exposures are worsening and the hedges again preserve value back to our original expectation.","But as it relates to year-over-year comparisons as we think to the back half of 2015 and then into 2016, the hedge rates we have in place in the first half of 2015 are very attractive particularly for the Euro, north of $1.30, $1.30 per euro which clearly we put in a place a long time ago.","But the hedge rates we have in place for the back half of \u201915 are less than that and certainly for 2016 are nowhere near that. So while they do not create incremental value necessarily in 2015 for Baxter, in 2016 if rates stay where they're at, sales will continue to be depressed but our hedge rate will imply a gross margin percentage and value that will be less than what we're seeing now.","We estimate at current rate that, that would be $70 million to $80 million of incremental headwind if you will in 2016 for the combined company, which equates to about $0.10 to $0.12.","So at current rates we would see that in 2016, but again I just want to emphasize the hedge gains improve reported gross margin percentage but in and of themselves are not necessarily added to the bottom line because they\u2019re there to hedge underlying exposure.","Kristen Stewart","And can you update just for 2015, where we stand now with the total Baxter impacts from a foreign exchange perspective?","Robert Parkinson","Yeah, it\u2019s still very much where we expected, excluding this anomaly in other income here in the quarter operationally in margins and of margin it's still very much where we had previously projected with again most of the negative impact, somewhere in the order of two-thirds of the negative impact of the approximately $0.40 that we projected for the year we're going to experience in the back half of \u201815?","Kristen Stewart","So $0.40 in the back half of \u201915 in total?","Robert Parkinson","$0.40 is our full year expectation, so excluding the anomaly of the other income in Q1 we're very much in that range still for 2015, but about two-thirds of that will impact us in the back half of the year for the reasons I mentioned the hedge rates are at less attractive levels for us and frankly the Euro has deteriorated from when initially gave guidance as well.","Kristen Stewart","Got it, okay. Thank you very much guys.","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Kristen.","Operator","Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse is online with the question. Please state your question.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple for Ludwig. Ludwig most of these net expense worked pretty well and the stock appears to have been handcuffed prior to the spend largely due to kind of perceived essential for us hemophilia specifically Factor VIII and FEIBA, there SubQ approaches that are out there in the development stage that are potentially once a month they work in the presence of inhibitors potentially Baxter 826 may be better than once per week dosing, but it\u2019s not humans yet.","Just schematically what\u2019s the company\u2019s view broadly speaking as to whether or not we should view Factor VIII and FEIBA as a kind of midterm grower or a decliner and if it\u2019s a decliner are there enough offsets of it really should matter for the new Baxalta.","Ludwig Hantson","This is a great question and you're going to feel the details on May 19. So I hope you'll be able to join us. But overall we believe that this business will continued to be a growth driver for us in all the different segments inhibitors as well as hemophilia.","What we're doing is we're building both breadth and depth in our portfolio. The depth as you mentioned with 855 hopefully launched by the end of this year, 826 and then moving to gene therapy. Everything is related to factor replacement, which is an advantage because the clinical, the regulatory piece, the manufacturing piece is very well understood.","So that\u2019s the path that we\u2019re on. The breadth is that we\u2019re going outside of hemophilia and you know that we have different opportunities in development. So overall this will continue to be a growth driver for us, but we\u2019re going to give you much more details on May 19.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much for that and just your commentary on HYQVIA is very interesting. I think you said 1500 of the 15,000 patient equivalents in USPID are sub-QPID are now captured. So like what\u2019s the sealing for that and what are the plans for extending that to non-PID applications?","Bob Parkinson","Well we\u2019re very pleased and we\u2019re pleased in the first place, because the feedback from the patient is very strong. But it also gives value to the payer as well. Overall, we believe let\u2019s say a decrease in total cost of therapy even though we were able to take a price premium, because of the equivalents of the bioavailability of HYQVIA.","So I believe it\u2019s a winner. We\u2019re in a position over the long-term to make this a leading product within PI. The opportunities that we have on the development side is to go outside of PI, that PI is about 20% to 25% of the total business.","So we\u2019re starting Phase III program in CIBP as well as we continue to look at extending the label with NPI. At this moment we\u2019ll restrict it to adults. So we\u2019re very, very pleased with the uptake six months in and we have 1500 patients out of 15,000.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much.","Mary Ladone","Hey Stephanie, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with the questions. Please state your questions.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks I just want to clarify as starting point just the FX impact commentary in the second quarter. So the $0.11 Bob as you called out for this quarter that would be offset in the $0.40 so the actual on a reported basis I guess the FX impact for the year is more like $0.30 this year and then another $0.20 to $0.22 next year is that how we should think about it?","Bob Hombach","Yeah, I would definitely separate the anomalous situation that occurred here in Q1 in other income from the operational FX we expect to incur, which again we continue to think is approximately $0.40 and at the op income line.","As it relates to 2016, my comments were specifically about the year-over-year potential for headwind related FX gains. The overall FX picture is clearly going to be defined by how currency rates move between now and in the end of 2015, which they have been fairly volatile.","And plus we\u2019ll have different impacts by business as well. So I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of myself here as it relates to overall expectations on FX impact in 2016 other than to say we\u2019ve hedged gains here are clearly going to be an issue at the current level of exchange rates and the current level of hedge rates we\u2019ve been able to achieve thus far in 2016 and again I peg that at about $0.10 to $0.12 on a year-over-year basis.","Mike Weinstein","Okay and then just to think about the $0.92 to $0.96 for the second quarter, so if we\u2019re analyzing that, which I realize is a problem doing that but it\u2019s all we've got to do with right now.","The incremental impact from there is the $0.40 of dyssynergies from the split and the net incremental FX impact as well was the whatever remaining erosion there is in cyclophosphamide is that fair?","Bob Parkinson","Well just to be clear when you say $0.40 of these synergies that\u2019s an annual number.","Mike Weinstein","Right.","Bob Parkinson","That\u2019s not going to incur in the back half of \u201815, but that\u2019s our current estimate of the annual impact. Initial dyssynergies from a run rate perspective I would tell you we\u2019ll get into this more in May, but both businesses are going to begin to do what we can to mitigate some of those dyssynergies even starting in 2016.","So that will be part of what we get into at the Investor Meeting here in a few weeks. But from a run rate perspective in the back half of \u201915, the $0.40 roughly well as I said approximately, $300 million or so in overall dyssynergies. So it\u2019s a bit more than $0.40.","Mike Weinstein","Right, okay, just a couple of quick product clarification, you said in the prepared comments Bob considering that 817 that even though everything has gone well there, you said regulatory submissions over the next several year.","So I was hoping you could clarify that because I think we\u2019re assuming that you submit that product later this year and then 855 Ludwig, if you could just comment on the dialogue with the FDA in the confidence and an approval later this year that would be great. That\u2019s all, thanks.","Ludwig Hantson","817, recombinant VII, so positive Phase 3 data, we have to power test we have a long list of products within hemophilia. We have to prioritize from a manufacturing perspective, 817 is lower in the ranks and that\u2019s the reason why, we will not be submitting later this year.","With respect to 855 the regulatory review is ongoing. No red flags at this moment and we believe that we still have the chance to get approval before yearend.","Mary Kay Ladone","And Stephanie our last question?","Operator","Our final question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your question please.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much for taking the question. So the first question I have is previously you guys suggested that fully loaded operating margin for Baxter medical products at the time of the spin would be in the low double digit range.","And I was wondering in light of all the comments today about that business, is that still a good number to think about in terms of the operating margin from the start or is that now a little more?","Robert Parkinson","Yeah, Bob we haven\u2019t been quite that specific. What we simply said, it would be at the very low end of the peers that for a number of reasons and frankly as we work through all of the details here on the separation including things like the pension that we currently have in the U.S. which generates simply the amount of expense and how that gets a portion between the two companies and so on.","Again we lay all this out at the Investor Meeting, but I just want to clarify, we haven\u2019t specified a start point if you will from an operating income margin perspective.","Bob Hopkins","Well then maybe another way to asking the question is in terms of what\u2019s happened at the business since the last call on Q4, you\u2019ve talked a lot about currency, I think we\u2019ve got that straight, there has been cost like they're the same.","Renal sounds a little worse, is there any other major moving parts you want to comment on here like is pension different than it was at the beginning of the year in terms of some of the big buckets we should be thinking about that might have changed again since the last conference call.","Robert Parkinson","Yeah, the only thing I would say about pension is due to the fact that we are going to be have to split the pension, that triggers a gap requirement for a re-measurement. This is the process that normally happens at the end of the year where you rebase, where you discount rate is, your asset return assumption etcetera, your mortality table the whole mind yards.","So there is a possibility that pension expense could be different. I think directionally interest rates are slightly lower now than they were at the end of the year. So there may be some impact. I don\u2019t think it's going to be super material. Other than that and the factors that you've mentioned, I don\u2019t think there is anything else in the business we\u2019ve talked about that has changed.","Bob Hopkins","And then lastly really quickly, are you guys going to address dividend policy at the upcoming meetings. Obviously there is given the decline in earnings there has been a lot of discussion about the dividend. Is that something you would lay out in detail at this meeting and just wondering how confident you are that you can maintain the total payout relative to what you\u2019re currently paying?","Robert Parkinson","Yes, as we said all along we're going to lay out the full financial outlook. The sales, the operating margins, the cash flow generation capabilities of two businesses as well as capital structure in terms of bed allocation and capital allocation policies including dividend policy, that will all be part of our discussions with investors on the 18 and 19 of May in New York.","Bob Hopkins","Great, thank you.","Robert Parkinson","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\u2019s Q&A session and today\u2019s conference call of Baxter International. Thank you for participating.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Kay Ladone, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Ladone, you may begin.","Mary Kay Ladone","Thanks Pam. Good morning everyone and welcome to our Q2, 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; Ludwig Hantson, President, BioScience; and Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and of course our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for more detailed concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.","In addition, in today\u2019s call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter\u2019s ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today, to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.","Bob Parkinson","Thanks Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you all for calling in. As you all saw in the press release issued earlier this morning, Baxter reported strong financial results for the second quarter, which exceeded expectations and we\u2019ve confirmed our full year 2014 outlook. ","Adjusted earnings increased 5% to $1.26 per diluted share and worldwide sales advanced 16%. Excluding Gambro and foreign currency, Baxter\u2019s sales rose 5%, driven by solid growth across our global franchises. ","Positive momentum continues to build and Baxter is off to a strong start in 2014. We\u2019re driving solid performance across our entire business portfolio in advancing care in both developed and emerging markets. This provides a strong foundation to build upon as we improve our competitive position, enhance operational, commercial and scientific effectiveness, continue to meet challenges posed by the global marketplace and regulatory environment and create value for patients, healthcare providers and other key stakeholders. I continue to be confident in our prospects for the long term and believe we are well positioned for sustained performance and success.","Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on improving access to care, as we broaden our global presence and advance the new product pipeline through both internal development and collaborations. During the quarter we announced an array of pipeline achievements and approvals; advanced R&D collaborations with our partners and made progress towards the separation into two leading healthcare companies. ","First within the bioscience business, we continue to build upon our global leadership position in Hemophilia that is evidenced by a number of recent achievements, including European regulatory approval of a new manufacturing facility in Singapore for the production of recombinant proteins including ADVATE and BAX 855 upon regulatory approval. ","Baxter was granted multi-year awards for ADVATE in the U.K. and in Australia, where ADVATE was named the preferred recombinant factor VIII treatment. Baxter recently received regulatory approvals for ADVATE in Turkey and Russia, supporting efforts to increase access to recombinant treatments in emerging markets. With these approvals, ADVATE is now approved in 62 countries worldwide. ","In addition the FDA granted approval for the BAXJECT III reconstitution system, which reduces the number of steps in the reconstitution process for patients and caregivers and we recently received European approval for myPKFiT, which is a new web-based individualized dosing device for prophylactic treatment. This device allows physicians to calculate personalized ADVATE treatment regiments based on patient information and individual pharmacokinetic profiles. ","Lastly, we\u2019ve now completed dosing for all patients in the Phase III clinical trial for BAX 855. To-date we have no reports of inhibitors or drug related serious adverse events. We look forward to sharing the top line data in the third quarter and continue to expect to file in the U.S. before the end of the year. ","In addition to our internal R&D accomplishments, we are collaborating with partners on advancing R&D programs in new disease areas with high unmet medical needs, which capitalize on our core technical capabilities, expertise and global channels. ","Progress to highlight includes first, initiation of two Phase III trials for an investigational etanercept biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis by our partner Coherus BioSciences. As you know, Baxter has obtained exclusive commercial rights for Europe, Canada, Brazil and certain other markets. ","Second, the announcement by our partners CTI BioPharma, on the completion of enrollment in its PERSIST-1 pivotal trial of pacritinib, a novel oral JAK2\/FLT3 inhibitor for patients with myelofibrosis, a chronic malignant bone marrow disorder. This is the first of two Phase III trials required to support regulatory approval. ","PERSIST-2 began earlier this year and is evaluating patients with low platelet counts for whom no viable treatment exists today. CTI and Baxter will jointly commercialize pacritinib in the U.S. and Baxter has been granted exclusive rights for all indications outside the U.S. ","And finally, we continue to augment our portfolio with acquisitions like Chatham Therapeutics, which we announced last quarter, and AesRx which we announced just last week. AesRx is a private U.S. biopharmaceutical company, focusing on sickle cell disease with its development program Aes-103. This investigational oral prophylactic treatment has clearly been evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial and has the potential to address an extremely high unmet clinical need in a community with inadequate treatment options and no recent major clinical advancements.","Moving on to medical products business, the recent highlights include the presentation of data at a European Renal conference supporting the safely and efficacy of the VIVIA hemodialysis system. As you know, the VIVIA system completed CE marking in Europe late last year, and is currently being introduced on a limited basis in 2014. ","In the U.S. we continue to engage in productive dialog with the FDA regarding the design of our final clinical trial supporting a nocturnal indication and we are working towards initiating this trial before the end of the year. In addition Baxter received 510-K clearance from the FDA for our next generation SIGMA Spectrum Infusion Pump, offering an option for wireless connectivity and integration of data into hospitals electronic medical record. ","Before I turn the call over to Bob to review our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year, I\u2019d like to take a moment to outline the progress we are making to create two separate independent global healthcare companies. ","First as you know, we\u2019ve named Bob Hombach, Chief Financial Officer of the new biopharmaceutical company and Jay Saccaro, Chief Financial Officer of Baxter International, following completion of the transaction. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working directly with Bob and Jay for many years and I\u2019m confident that both businesses are positioned for future success given their deep knowledge of these businesses, financial expertise and their leadership qualities. ","In addition, last week we announced the appointment of Dr. John Orloff as Vice President and Global Head of R&D for Baxter BioScience. Dr. Orloff will be responsible for advancing the late stage bioscience pipeline, enhancing the current R&D operating model and pursuing additional innovative opportunities for the business. Dr. Orloff joins Bioscience from Merck Serono Pharmaceuticals, where he served as Global Head of Clinical Development. ","We continue to work diligently to prepare the organization for the spinoff and expect to announce additional senior leadership appointments in the coming months. In addition we are currently targeting the filing of a preliminary Form-10 with the SEC before the end of the year. We\u2019re planning to host an Investor Conference in New York in the second quarter of 2015 to provide details on both companies, and we expect to finalize the transaction by mid 2015.","As always, I\u2019d be happy to address questions on this or any topic during the Q&A this morning, but with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Hombach","Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter advanced 5% to $1.26, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share. This over achievement can primarily be attributed to strong sales across several franchises, including cyclophosphamide in the absence of any new competition and the favorable timing of a large (inaudible) shipment originally scheduled for the third quarter. These items each drove favorability versus our guidance of approximately $0.02 per diluted share respectively. ","As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.95 per diluted share included net special items totaling $172 million or $0.31 per diluted share, primarily for intangible amortization and costs associated with contingent revenue and product development milestone payments, remediation efforts related to the in-progress SPECTRUM Infusion Pump recall, integration of the company\u2019s acquisition of Gambro, and Baxter\u2019s planned separation into two independent healthcare companies. These charges were partially offset by the reversal of certain business optimization and litigation reserves. ","Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2014. Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4.3 billion advanced 16% on both a reported and constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across our global franchises. This performance exceeded our sales growth guidance range of 12% to 13%. Excluding Gambro revenues of $408 million, Baxter sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis.","In terms of individual business performance, Global Bioscience sales exceeded $1.7 billion and advanced 7% in the second quarter. On a constant currency basis sales increased 6%. Within the product categories, haemophilia sales of $904 million increased 6% on both the reported and constant currency basis. ","We continue to capitalize on our global leadership position and brand differentiation. New product launches including the new fiber prophylactic indication and Rixubis for the treatment of Haemophilia B, and increased penetration of recombinant therapies, particularly in emerging markets. ","Specifically global demand for ADVATE remains very strong, resulting in double digit growth for the quarter and year-to-date. This reflects the positive patient experience with our brands and ongoing benefits derived from our prophylactic label expansion, augmented by shipments to Brazil as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobras to advance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy. To-date we have converted more than 35% of the 10,000 Haemophilia A patients in Brazil and continue to expect to generate sales of more than $100 million in 2014. ","In addition, global demand for fiber remains robust. We are benefiting from the new prophylactic indication in the U.S., where we generated double digit growth this quarter and we recently received approval in Canada, Australia and Japan. As you may recall, only 15% to 20% of inhibitor patients globally are treated prophylactically, presenting a significant long term growth opportunity for our Haemophilia franchise.","In biotherapeutics, sales of $548 million increased 7% on a reported basis and increased 6% on a constant currency basis. This reflects sequential improvement driven by enhanced product availability and growth of immunoglobulin therapies, albumin and alpha-1 treatments. ","Consistent with last quarter, the U.S. sales increased 7%, while international sales were up 4%.International growth was marked by improved growth for immunoglobulin therapies and albumin, as we\u2019ve resumed albumin shipments to China. While the U.S. growth may moderate in the second half of the year due to tough comparisons, we expect international growth to accelerate on a sequential basis in the third and fourth quarters. ","In BioSurgery, sales totaled $189 million and increased 6%. On a constant currency basis sales rose 5%, driven by increased penetration for surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL, particularly outside the U.S. As you know, growth of these products is tied directly to grow in surgical procedures, which remains very modest.","Finally, vaccine revenues totaled $110 million and increased 12%. Sales grew 6% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by strong sales of the FSME vaccine, which was partially offset by lower milestone payments related to government collaborations for the development of influenza vaccines.","In medical products, global sales of more than $2.5 billion increased 24% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding Gambro, medical product sales grew 4% on a constant currency basis. ","Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $1 billion, which includes the contribution from Gambro of $408 million. Excluding Gambro, renal sales of $636 million declined 3% or 1% on a constant currency basis as expected.","PD patient gains in the U.S. have never been stronger, driving U.S. PD growth of 15%. However this was more than offset by lower international sales, which were impacted by the timing of certain tenders which we discussed last quarter, and the divestiture of the CRRT business. Excluding these items which totaled approximately $40 million, global renal sales increased approximately 4%.","Sales in the fluid system category of $816 million increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. Performance continues to be driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV solutions and other injectables, particularly for cyclophosphamide.","As you may know, to-date we have not experienced any new competition for cyclo and we\u2019ve updated our full year guidance to reflect our new assumption. On the year-to-date basis, the U.S. cyclophosphamide sales totaled approximately $225 million.","Specialty pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies posted sales of $404 million, reflecting an increase of 10%. Sales rose 9% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by increased penetration of Suprane in markets outside the U.S. and high single digit growth of our global nutrition franchise. ","Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business totaled $249 million and declined 3% on a reported basis or 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily to the timing of shipments and lower third party demand, which was partially offset by strong pharmacy compounding revenues.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 50.7% compared to 53.0% last year. Margin expansion in the base Baxter business resulting from mixed benefits was more than offset by the impact of the lower margin Gambro business and foreign currency, which collectably reduced the rate by approximately 250 basis points.","SG&A totaled $961 million and increased 18% with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the growth. Excluding Gambro SG&A increased 4%, as leverage close to arise from benefits associated with our business optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by select investments and promotional end marketing initiatives for new product launches and with the international market to enhance our global presence, and the incremental expedited freight charges to support the strong demand we are seeing in the U.S. medical products business.","R&D spending in the quarter of $292 million increased 15% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro R&D spending rose 2%. We continue to advance the new product pipeline and accelerate investments in a number of areas, including programs in our leading hemophilia franchise, those leveraging our expertise in the therapeutic areas of hematology, oncology and immunology and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the continuum of care.","The operating margin in the quarter of 20.3% is lower than last year\u2019s operating margin of 23.8%. Excluding Gambro, the operating margin with 23.5% as positive mix was offset by foreign currency and investments in SG&A and R&D. Interest expense was $42 million in the second quarter, which reflects debt issuances to fund both the Gambro acquisition and the Covington plasma manufacturing site.","Other income totaled $70 million, driven primarily by the favorable foreign exchange impact on balance sheet positions. The tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations and as previously mentioned adjusted earnings per diluted share advanced 5% to $1.26. ","For the first half of 2014, cash flow from operations was strong and totaled approximately $1.2 billion, reflecting an improvement versus last year. DSO ended the quarter as 56.7 days and excluding Gambro, Baxter\u2019s DSO was 53 days, slightly lower than the prior year."," ","Inventory turns of 2.2 are comparable to the prior year period and lastly in the first half of the year we repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares for $450 million dollars or on a net basis, 2 million shares for $218 million, in line with our full year objective.","Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2014. For the full year, we now expect adjusted earnings of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share. We continue to provide a wider guidance range than our historical practice, as the number of factors and assumptions impact the outlook in the second half for the year, particularly potential headwinds related to cyclophosphamide competition in foreign currency.","As mentioned earlier, we have updated our assumptions for cyclophosphamide competition. While this has resulted in a transitory benefit, it also provides the opportunity to accelerate investments that will better position both BioScience and the medical products businesses for sustained success going forward. ","For the full year the cyclo benefit is currently estimated to be more than $0.20 per diluted share. This benefit will largely be offset by incremental investments we are making across the portfolio, and by absorbing a foreign currency impact of almost $0.25 per diluted share in 2014, which is approximately $0.10 per share higher than our original expectations.","Specifically by line under the P&L, starting with sales, we now expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 10% to 11%, which includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 9% to 10%. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter business to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis.","For the full year we continue to expect gross margin for the company to decline by approximately 150 basis points from the 2013 margin of 52%. Positive sales mix in the base Baxter business is more than offset by Gambro and the full year foreign currency impact of approximately 100 basis points.","In terms of expenses, we continue to invest and support the elevated level of sales reflected in our guidance, as well as accelerated spending in sales and marketing to support new product launches and R&D investments, primarily related to recent business development activity within BioScience, while making incremental investments in our medical products operations to enhance our operational effectiveness. As a result, we now expect R&D and SG&A to grow in high single digits for the full year, representing an increase of approximately $200 million versus our original 2014 expectations. This includes an incremental impact from foreign currency of approximately $50 million dollars. ","We expect interest expense to total approximately $160 million, and we now expect other income of approximately $70 million for the full year, the vast majority of which has already been recognized in the first half of the year. We expect a tax rate of approximately 21.5% and we expect a full year average share count of approximately 547 million shares, which assumes approximately 300 million in net share repurchases.","From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5 billion, which excludes the cash cost associated with the spin-off of the biopharmaceuticals business. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.","Let me move to sales and expand on our assumptions for the two businesses and the major product categories. Beginning with medical products, on a constant currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro, we now expect sales growth of approximately 14% to 15%. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for medical products to grow 1% to 2%. Specifically we expect renal sales to grow approximately 40%, including the benefit of continued PD penetration, and the incremental revenue contribution from Gambro.","We now expect Fluid Systems sales to be flat to up 2%, reflecting a benefit of approximately $150 million relative to our original guidance. We are now assuming that we experience competition for cyclophosphamide later this year, reducing sales by approximately $50 million to $75 million compared to sales in the second half of 2013. We continue to expect specialty pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics to grow in the 3% to 5% range and we expect our BioPharma solution sales to be flat for the full year.","For BioScience, we are also raising our guidance and now project sales growth excluding foreign currency of 4% to 5%. Our outlook includes sales growth in our global hemophilia franchise of 5% to 6%. While we continue to expect increased competition for recombinant factor VIII therapies in the second half of this year, performance will be fueled by underlying global demand for ADVATE, convergent to recombinant therapy in Brazil, new tender awards and continued benefits from new product launches, including RIXUBIS and FEIBA prophylaxis."," ","For the BioTherapeutics franchise, we continue to expect growth of approximately 4%, with sales of immunoglobulin therapies and albumin in China ramping up in the second half of the year.","And finally for our BioSurgery and vaccine businesses, we now expect growth in the low to mid single-digits.","As mentioned in our press release, for the third quarter we expect earnings per diluted share excluding special items of $1.28 to $1.32. We expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of 12% to 13%. Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales at constant currency rates to grow approximately 4% to 5%.","Thanks. I\u2019ll now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International\u2019s website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. ","Our first question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now opened.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a strong quarter. I wanted to get right to kind of the key [controversies] [ph] surrounding the stock right now, which is the sustainability of your hemophilia franchise. You\u2019ve raised hemophilia guidance for the back half of this year. At the same time you are starting to see the competition now coming from the longer acting factor VIII. ","Just wondering if you could kind of comment on, is that hemophilia guidance raise coming from kind of the confidence in sustainability of your ADVATE franchise in the face of competition or is it coming more from some of these other growth drivers that you mentioned. Just give us a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about that business moving forward? Thank you.","Bob Parkinson","Bob and Ludwig, you want to respond to Derrick\u2019s questions. ","Ludwig Hantson","Sure. Hi Derrick, this is Ludwig. So overall we are very pleased with our hemophilia performance. As Bob was saying, we are increasing our sales guidance. I think the confidence is coming from different angles. First of all we feel that our ADVATE gold standard position is a strong position and that we believe that we will be able to continue to grow our ADVATE position through different factors. ","In addition to that we have new products coming in, we have RIXUBIS. In addition to that the fiber prophy indication is also a strong growth driver. In addition to that we have geographical expansion playing a role. So overall we feel good about the guidance that we gave you and we believe it\u2019s coming from different angles here.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","Could you perhaps give us, quantify a little bit more for us the opportunity from the recent OUS tender wins and the launches in Russia and Turkey of ADVATE, as well as maybe Bob, if you can give us a sense for how much Brazil is contributing this quarter?","Bob Parkinson","Sure Derrick. The tender wins in Australia and the U.K., we really will start ramping up activity here in the back half of 2014. So relative to our expectations and we did have a good line of sight on one of those two to begin with, so relative to our expectations, not much of an incremental contribution here in 2014. ","But as we move into \u201815 and beyond, these are multi-year tender awards and I think position us to significantly increase our market share in the U.K. where it had gotten down to below 10% at one point here and as you know we were completely out of the Australian market and now we have the preferred position. So we\u2019ve not specifically quantified that opportunity at this point, but for both of them, it will be a meaningful opportunity to grow internationally and a key franchise for us.","As it relates to Brazil, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, we are going to experience some lumpiness here as we continue to ramp-up conversion and continue to open up the opportunity for different segments within Brazil, and so again we are projecting more than $100 million of sales here. The contribution in the second quarter was fairly modest. We do expect that to ramp up throughout the course of the back-half of this year, so more than half of that $100 million is going to happen in the back-half.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","May be one final follow-up to Ludwig\u2019s comments. Ludwig can you may be just give us a little bit more detail now that the Biogen longer acting is in the market and that you\u2019ve seen the label. Could you just may be give us a little bit more detail on sort of your expectations for the impact from that versus what you were thinking before as you\u2019ve seen the label and any additional color on the early progress of their launch and how you\u2019re specifically detailing against that competition? Thank you.","Ludwig Hantson","Yes Derrick, I think that their label is not much differentiated from the ADVATE label. If you look at the ADVATE label, it has very strong annual bleed rate data in there which is unsurpassed, and which is still from a patient perspective the most important thing. We also have individualized PK in our label. We have every three day dosing in the label and when you look at the use of ADVATE, our ADVATE prophy patients are on an every three day or longer dosing regimen already. ","And so the data that we\u2019ve shared with all of you are survey data that comes from patients and healthcare providers, tells us that yes the interest of the community is there for a longer acting. The definition of a longer acting for hemophilia A is one per week or longer dosing regimen. ","So our expectation is the same as the guidance that we gave you and that is we expect a single digit impact on our ADVATE to market share till 855 comes on board. Bob talked about the fact that we\u2019ve completed the enrollment, we completed all the assessments, we are on track to share 855 data with you third quarter and we are still on track for a submission by the end of this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Yes hi, good morning. For Bob Hombach and then I have one for Bob Parkinson. Just again, I just want to want to make sure I\u2019m understanding the cyclo updated guidance. So are you saying now that you obviously haven\u2019t seen any competition yet and now you\u2019re thinking later in this year and on top of that I think you had been initially anticipating about a $0.25 impact. Are you now saying it\u2019s $0.20? Again, I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting that all correct.","Bob Hombach","We are now expecting competition to enter late Q3 to early Q4. We had previously guided to a potential negative impact of $0.20 to $0.30 that we baked into our initial guidance and from that initial guidance we are saying that\u2019s going to get a little bit more than $0.20 better. So we are going to have improvements relative to our expectation around cyclo. Our original expectation is a little more than $0.20.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay, and then you mentioned the investments that you\u2019re going to make against that, so how do we sort of think about the net impact of all of this.","Bob Hombach","Well, the net impact is as you know we didn\u2019t change our overall guidance. So I talked a little bit about a pretty significant ongoing currency head-wind that we\u2019re incurring here of an incremental $0.10 to our expectation as well, so that\u2019s largely half of it. The rest of it relates to incremental investments that we\u2019re making and as you know, we did a couple of business development deals here recently in gene therapy for haemophilia A, as well as an acquisition for sickle cell anemia treatment. ","Those are going to come with R&D burns with them and so that is going to ramp up our R&D spend. That and a few other things, about $50 million for the rest of this year and then we\u2019re making internal investments to support numerous new product launches, primarily in BioScience and SG&A. Those two make up the bulk of the difference between the $0.20 benefit from cyclo and the $0.10 downside related to FX.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Got you. And then I guess for Bob and may be for Ludwig, obviously post the Medtronic and Covidien deal and some of these other ones that are getting announced, clearly scale is something that seems to be dramatic out there. You guys obviously are going to innately get smaller with the spin off. So, I\u2019m wonder if you could sort of discuss a little bit about how you guys think in the individual businesses, the needs to get better and to get bigger and sort of perhaps the strategy behind that.","Bob Parkinson","Let me make some, may be some general comments for both businesses and then more specifically regarding new BAX and if Ludwig wants to comment on new bio going forward. Stating the obvious, we are consumed right now with activities associated with the spin. So it\u2019s not about -- at this stage thinking about getting bigger, it\u2019s about really moving forward to executive effectively the spin. ","Of course one of the strategic motivations behind the decision itself was to increase the focus in both businesses. I can tell you from the new BAX perspective if you will, we feel there is significant opportunities to grow earnings at a faster rate than sales as a result of a number of things, but one of which is to your question, I think aggressively managing portfolio, whether that\u2019s business product, geographic portfolio and so on and I think you can anticipate post-spin activity in that regards. ","That also sets the stage then, I think to be proactive in term the acquisitions and so on to kind of reshape if you will the portfolio that comprises the new Baxter going forward. But again, those are the things we\u2019re evaluating right now, but not spending a lot of time on given the focus of the energy slurries is really on the spin. ","Ludwig, I don\u2019t know, from a new bio perspective if you want to add anything to that. I think probably it describes the intention of your organization right now as well.","Ludwig Hantson","Correct. I think the question is not, how do we bigger here. I think the question is finding the right opportunity within the disease area that we are focusing on, which is immunology and hematology, oncology. And I think the question, can we make the difference in the patients\u2019 life and how can we bring value.","Bob Parkinson","Yes, I think that\u2019s a great summary, in fact. I think you said it\u2019s not about getting bigger at this stages, it\u2019s about getting better and the spin, and its heart was really about intensifying the focus in each of the businesses so that we can be better, both from an innovation point of view, as well as how we launch and commercialize our products and manage the portfolios in both business. So the question of getting bigger is something we always think about, but I would tell you right now, it\u2019s not really front burner. ","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Bob Hombach, I just want to come back to the margins here for a second. I understand the discretionary spending in the back half of the year, but it\u2019s released the second quarter. Were some of these discretionary spending items present in the second quarter, because obviously we would expect a little more up-side here in the second quarter, relative to our expectations, given the very strong revenue. ","And then Bob, some of the things you described are discretionary in nature in the back half of the year. How much do those carry forward into next year, because some of these you described are more base line spending on some of the new JV initiatives and some I imagine you can modulate pretty good heading into \u201915. So if you can give us a sense of whether these items are kind of \u201914 discretionary or linger into \u201915 and then I have a quick follow-up.","Bob Hombach","Okay. Yes, as it relates to second quarter, there was a fairly significant impact of gross margins. We did see some incremental SG&A, not so much in R&D yet. As I mentioned the two new acquisitions really are just going to start impacting BioScience from our R&D run rate perspective in the second half of this year. ","But from a gross margin perspective, the impact was pretty significant in the second quarter, primarily from FX, and the driver there really is the euro and as you know, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, given our global footprint, we have significant sales in Europe in the base Baxter business. Gambro had more than 50% of their sales in Western Europe as well. So that actually increased our exposure on the sales line, which is a good thing. ","But on the cost side, historically we\u2019ve been able to mute most of Euro fluctuations at the gross margin line through a combination of our manufacturing footprint and financial hedging that we do. But as we\u2019ve added Gambro into the mix, Gambro actually has a disproportionate amount of their manufacturing footprint in Europe and so their cost relative to revenue was much higher in Europe. ","So in fact the very strong Euro that we saw in the second quarter was a pretty meaningful negative to gross margin, because sales were higher related to the FX translation. But costs were even higher and so there\u2019s pretty meaningful gross margin impact as we mentioned between that and Gambro, a 250 basis point negative on gross margin. So the lack of drop during the second quarter more is related to gross margin, primarily FX and less to do with these incremental investments, which again are primarily back half. ","And then as it relates to discretionary, clearly the R&D run rate for those two acquisitions is going to be their going forward. The SG&A and new product launches, those certainly can be modulated and that\u2019s what we are doing now. We do have a platter of new products to position in the market over the next six to 12 months and we are going to make sure we make the right investment there, but we do have a bit more flexibility on that.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, helpful, thanks Bob. And then Bob Parkinson, just as you think about the spin heading into next year, obviously one of the biggest drivers of the medical products business will still be Gambro and then the broader Renal franchise. So maybe you can give us an update here over the last six months. Where do you think you stand as it relates to the organic growth profile you expected at Gambro? There\u2019s capacity coming back on line and some of the cost opportunities that you saw. How would you give us sort of a summation of where Gambro sits across some of those metrics? Thank You.","Bon Parkinson","Sure Dave. I would say first of all, at a high level we are tracking very well with the original expectations. More specifically in terms of the cost synergies, again tracking just may be a little bit behind in the short term, but longer term we feel that the target we communicated to you is more than achievable. ","Encouraging earlier returns, I think on commercial synergies. So when you look at the size of the business, in terms of revenue what\u2019s becoming increasingly evident is the way to really monitor and this business is more broadly what we call Baxter Gambro Renal now, because we are seeing in the market place the expectation that the full complement of products would lever the legacy Baxter businesses, Peritoneal Dialysis and obviously home haemo going forward. In fact, if you look at our total Renal business revenue growth continues to perform very well and so in that sense, in terms of the revenue line, we continue to be very optimistic that we will achieve, if not exceed the original expectations. ","Having said that, on the legacy Gambro business, we continue to focus on ramping up capacity specifically in the dialyzer area, which is going to continue to be a challenge over the next year or two. Simply stated there\u2019s more demand right now than our ability to deliver. You know some of the historical issues that the previous owners of Gambro were dealing with in that regard and so on. But we are moving forward to expand capacity. Our two primary dialyzer facilities in Hessiga, Germany and Opelika, Alabama, and it\u2019s just a matter of time before we get that capacity ramped up, so that we can accelerate the growth of the dialyzer business. ","The acute business in the hospital is growing very nicely and the monitor business, we are pleased with how the monitor business is performing, specifically some of the reliability improvements and so on. So without getting more granular, I would say again back where I stated at a high level, things are tracking very nicely with our expectations.","Operator","Thank You. Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs ","Thank You. Good Morning everybody. I wanted to start with, I think the announcement was, it was yesterday and you highlighted it today on the call, the initiation to the Phase III trials in an Etanercept. May be you could just talk a little bit more about what you see the U.S. regulatory pathway being for your biosimilar program and how we should sort of expect that to unfold over the next couple of years.","Ludwig Hantson","Hi David, it\u2019s Ludwig. I think as you said, its evolving and I don\u2019t think everybody has the answers here. But for us it\u2019s critical that this is an opportunity to create access to these molecules. We are building a portfolio. We believe that a portfolio approach for us is critical, so we are building this portfolio and at this moment we have three molecules; one vertigo here and then there\u2019s two with Momenta. ","I think there is an opportunity within the regulatory pathway to go for interchangeability. Of course that\u2019s going to depend on finalizing those regulations, as well as what are the product characteristics. So we believe that we are in a strong situation, at least with one of the approaches that we have to shoot for interchangeability.","I think you\u2019ve seen that some of those, at least one of molecules is in Phase III. The other molecules continue to advance in the development. So stay tuned, we\u2019ll know more as we move forward here."," ","Mary Kay Ladone"," ","And David, specifically related to Etanercept, remember we have OUS rights in Europe and several markets outside the U.S., so it\u2019s not a product that we will have the rights for in the U.S. ","David Roman - Goldman Sachs ","Got it, thank you. And then just a follow-up may be to Bob Parkinson\u2019s comment. I think in response to one of the earlier questions about leverage in the business and you did reference the potential for the remaining Baxter International to generate revenue growth and earning with earning growth pacing at a faster rate. Could you maybe just talk about the opportunity set there, because one of the things that stands out to us, at least when I look at your quarterly or annual filings, is the extent its current medical product margin sits below peers and I assume we\u2019ll see more in the From 10. But maybe you sort of just preview for us some of the opportunities that exist there to close the gap in your mid products margin versus peers that has the potential to drive the outsized earnings growth for some period of time. ","Bob Parkinson","Sure David. Well first of all, kind of at a high level, everybody focuses on the creating of the BioScience spin off at the new public company, but I will tell you, our mindset is we are creating two new companies here. The spinoff of BioScience provides the legacy Baxter business, which as you know I will run going forward. I think an opportunity to reevaluate anything and everything that we do and I think that\u2019s really healthy and that\u2019s the mindset that we are embracing.","First of all, I think intensifying focus on higher margin growth areas, product categories like anesthesia, parenteral nutrition, certainly the BioSurgery business, which while we\u2019ve developed that market very nicely in the U.S., it continuous to be very undeveloped in many markets outside the U.S. ","Also infusion pumps. With the approval of the SIGMA Spectrum a month or so ago and the anticipated launch later this year with that, it\u2019s going to put us in a position to play offence in infusion pumps for the first time really in many years. If you look at the margin accretion opportunity over the next five years or so in the infusion pump business for us to regain the share that we lost over the years in the U.S. due to the calling situation, and then be able to expand outside the U.S. there\u2019s probably $0.30, $0.35 of EPS equivalent associated with margin accretion opportunities just in the infusion pump area. So anesthesia, nutrition, infusion pump, BioSurgery, all higher margin areas will benefit from intensified focus and as I mentioned, infusion pumps benefiting from now the ability to play offense with the recent approval. ","I commented earlier then on the opportunities in terms of portfolio and I think that there is significant opportunities to evaluate. As an example, core businesses like IV\u2019s. In certain markets the IV business where we can bundle with the contract that includes the disposable sets, the infusion pumps, the secondary, the mini bags, the pre-mixes and so on, continues to be a very attractive business from a return on investment. ","In certain markets in IV\u2019s where we\u2019re contracting separately for IV\u2019s, these are largely international markets, I think we really need to be more aggressive in terms of evaluating what is the sustainable value of these businesses, and so that\u2019s the kind of example from a portfolio, geographic in that sense. The kind of things that I think we will be much more proactive in. ","I also think in terms of this new mindset and I\u2019m challenging the organization to evaluative, really new paradigms in a lot of different areas. This recent IV shortage in the U.S. I think has sensitized a lot of people to the value of these products; products that largely have been taken for granted historically, which are essential to saving and sustaining lives and I described it as always the best deal in healthcare, to be able of pay for half a liter or a liter of IV at lower price than a bottle of water at Seven-Eleven, that kind of puts it in perspective and I think there\u2019s opportunity there in terms of taking prices up and really getting value commensurate with the value that those products serve clinically and so on. ","So I\u2019ll stop there. I would just tell you, I\u2019m very excited to really lead this new organization and I think focus on those areas for margin accretion that exists. So this will be a subject we\u2019ll talk a lot about in the coming months and certainly post-spin as we crystallize more specifically, but there\u2019s fertile ground here I believe, to support my earlier comment about being able to drive earnings growth at a much faster rate than revenue growth in this new business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Thank you for taking the questions. First one, Bob Hombach, when you had the late March call to announce the separation, it sounded like you still had a fair amount of work to do to put some numbers behind the separation costs. Have you had any additional work done on what you think the dilution from the spin will be; meaning really, for you guys will be all the incremental overhead that will have to be created, and I think you said at that time you didn't expect any tax leakage. So has there been any change there? Thanks. ","Bob Hombach","Yes, and no change on the view on tax leakage as I mentioned. I think transactionally we as create legal entities and move assets and people in various countries around the world, there may be small amount which will call out as separate special items, but in terms of ongoing tax rate for the two businesses, no change in prior view. Nothing significant we see for either business here at this stage. ","As it relates to synergy, we\u2019re certainly working diligently internally to estimate what gross synergies are going to be and then how we\u2019re going to go about mitigating them, how much before the spin occurs and how we will be able to get out the cost position over the first year or two. Again, we\u2019re not seeing anything significant or different than what our consultants would say the benchmarks look like, so nothing has popped up and no red flags from what I said before that I think we are largely going to be in line with the type of operational, this synergy you\u2019ve seen from other spin-offs. ","I would say though that our international footprint, which represents 60% of our sales on an annual basis, we are very integrated, it will be very complicated to separate the two businesses, but I think as we create a new biopharmaceutical company in an international framework, we\u2019ll be able to do that in a fairly streamlined way. So again, there may be a little bit of extra dilution on day one related to international, but nothing significant.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay. And then can you give us an update on maybe \u2013 well, it maybe two items. One, you haven't talked about recently the plans for the vaccine business. Has there been any progress there? And then two, we've got the [IQVU] (ph) panel coming up at the end of the month. Can you set expectations for what we'll see that will be new in the panel pack, and how you expect the language from the FDA to read in the panel pack? Thanks."," ","Bob Parkinson","Bob, you want to handle the vaccines and\u2026","Bob Hombach","Yes, certainly. As we mentioned earlier this year, we did take the strategic decision to look at, first a couple of development programs within R&D, particularly flu and our line program and see if those would be better served to be partnered or divested and we also were open potentially to our two inline vaccines to divesting those as well, depending on the preference of the partner. ","So we\u2019ve gone through a process, talked to a lot of different interested parties and that process is ongoing, so not appropriate to comment further now. We are very focused on optimizing the value of the overall vaccine portfolio and as we make progress, we\u2019ll certainly share that as appropriate, so still working on it, but nothing to update at the moment. ","Ludwig Hantson","With respect to the [IQVU] (ph) panel scheduled for July 31, the team is getting ready for the interaction, the dialogue. No new questions. It\u2019s still the same as we discussed, the four questions or the questions related to long term safety of the antibodies related to a pH20 and specifically neuronal development in fertility, so nothing new there. ","I\u2019m very pleased that you will be able to see all our data and we believe that our data is clean and that we have a positive benefit risk, but as you will be there most likely, we\u2019ll have a great dialogue with the FDA.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Thank you Ludwig.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now opened. ","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning Bob, how are you doing? ","Bob Parkinson","Hi.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Bigger picture first. You're clearly investing heavily on the biosciences side pre-spin, seemingly on the surface a little less though in medical devices, although obviously Gambro is a big investment that you're integrating. So definitely you're actively supplementing biopharma ahead of the spin. ","Should we expect that Medical Product business development opportunities could come before the spin too or are you going to focus on that post-spin? And maybe just as part of that, as long as I'm laying it all out here, it sounds like you're interested in M&A. What areas are you likely to be thinking about? Something directly related to the existing business or broadening the scope of the post-spin med device company? Thanks. ","Bob Parkinson","Okay Rick, thanks for the questions, several things. Yes, I mean obviously when Gambro is the largest acquisition in the history of the company, so that really expresses an investment I guess in the new batch, but I think may be what is under appreciated is much is in the R&D area. The nature of the investments have been really in new systems; home hemodialysis, the VIVIA system, which we\u2019re really excited about has been a five year investment. Likewise the AMIA system which is our next generation home choice and so on. So those don\u2019t jump out in the way that our bio pharmaceutical investments do, but we have been making meaningful investments in internal R&A, those being just a couple of examples. ","Relative to business development activity going forward, I mean we continue to be open to that, despite as you say, and we all know our primary focus is the spin. I\u2019m not suggesting we won\u2019t do anything, but if we do, it will be of the smaller nature.","Longer term, look we think there continue to be opportunities within the two core areas, which are the treatment of end stage renal disease, as well as the hospital channel. With the movement of the BioSurgery business over to the new Baxter going forward, very few companies can represent the breadth and diversity of products that are sold in the acute care hospital and so from an acquisition business development point of view going forward, that will continue to be I think a major area of focus to further solidify the channel. ","I\u2019m not sure what percent of all healthcare dollars are either spent or driven through the acute care channel, but it\u2019s a very high percentage and as I say, very few companies have a strong over presence in platform from a channel perspective there as we do. So I think it\u2019s fair to say, at a very high level that will drive our business development, including acquisition efforts going forward. ","Ludwig Hantson","And Rick, I would just point out that I did mention in my prepared comments that in addition to the SG&A and R&D investments, we are making investments in operations within medical products. We\u2019re seeing very strong demand, particularly in the U.S. for IV\u2019s and PD and we\u2019re seeing the regulatory environment raising the bar on everything from production through logistics, so there are incremental investments going in to that as well.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Right, and just to follow up quickly on renal, Bob Hombach as you said, PD gains are very strong in the quarter, up 15% in the U.S. Is that kind of growth sustainable? May be help us understand that and help us understand a little bit more about the timing issues OUS. I mean, do they swing back positive in the second half? It didn\u2019t happen in the second quarter, but now they have happened. I\u2019m not sure I fully understood what was going on there. Thank you.","Bob Parkinson","Well, let me, Rick I\u2019ll comment on kind of what I\u2019ll call the market trends and then if Bob wants to add some color in terms of specifically the financial flow and so on, he can do that. It\u2019s fair to say that globally, not just the U.S. but globally there is a movement in tumor treatment in the home, okay, whether that\u2019s peritoneal dialysis or over time home hemodialysis and you see a number of countries, Thailand being one, Taiwan being another. ","In the case of Thailand, what they called PD first, which says, look as we provide access to treatment of in-stage renal disease, the government policy is going to drive treatment in home. There is this general feeling that its lower cost, it certainly is greater convenience for patients and in some cases and we believe very strongly in terms of home hemodialysis we are going to be able to demonstrate advancing clinical outcomes in a terms in a meaning full way, such as life expectancy and so on. ","So when you see the same dynamics going on in the U.S. and so in response to the first part of question Rick, yes I think the strength that we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. market for PD, clearly is going to continue. I think it\u2019s driven by kind of a rebalancing of the reimbursements, so now there are economic incentives for the providers to be in PD and ways in the past there were not and then of course with our launch over time of a home hemodialysis, I think it further accelerated to grow.","So simply stated in the U.S., I think the strength you\u2019re seeing is not a transient effect. I think it\u2019s a representation of some more longer-term environmental trends and give us confidence that that kind of growth is sustainable. ","Bob you want to comment maybe more specifically on the numbers part of it.","Bob Hombach","Yes, so as it relates to PD patients in the U.S., I mean we\u2019ve seen a pretty consistent trend over the last five or six quarters of high single digit, low double digit PD patient growth. So that demand is there with the harmonization around reimbursement. We are certainly seeing a very strong move in the U.S. in particular. So I don\u2019t think 15% necessarily is sustainable, but certainly high single digit, low double digit PD patient growth here in the near term is certainly a possibility.","And OUS, given the mix of revenue that we get per patient in different markets, whatever the renal sales number we are reporting, you can be assured that the patient growth is probably a little faster for all the reasons that Bob just mentioned. So we are globally seeing very strong PD patient growth, but particularly in the U.S. ","Bob Parkinson","The other think that I would mentioned again from a macro perspective is that in many emerging markets and developing markets you have a lot of patients that aren\u2019t even being treated today. So it\u2019s one of the reasons we made the investment in Gambro that we did. This is a large market, it\u2019s going to continue to growth. By virtue of the Gambro acquisition we have established a leadership position in this market, augmented by the existing launch system, new products such as VIVIA in the home and I think it\u2019s a good bet that we made long term. ","Bob Hombach","Yes, last think I\u2019ll add, the second quarter is somewhat depressed because of the timing of our tender as we talked about in Q1 related to renal, so I\u2019d really look at year-to-date sales as being more indicative of the trend. ","Bob Parkinson","Yes good point. ","Mary Kay Ladone","","Sam, we have time for two more questions. ","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to check, just with the respect to the spin-off, at the time of the announcement, you guys had commented that you do not anticipate being able to redomicile the BioScience businesses. Is that still the case or have your thoughts changed at all?","Bob Parkinson","No change. I mean certainly just as a function of a spin out. That is not an opportunity to do a tax-free redomiciling. So that\u2019s not on the radar. ","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just on the IG business, can you comment just a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the dynamic between price and then the supply in the marketplace, because it sounds like price has been a little less favorable than what it has been historically, particularly within the U.S.","Bob Parkinson","Yes, I would say we\u2019ve had very modest expectations on price in the U.S. over the last couple of years and our longer range outlook assume that as well. So I think that remains largely consistent. We are looking forward to having enhanced supply here as we go forward. We are able to support market growth here in \u201814 and \u201915 with our current footprint and we continue to work with Sanguine to bring flexible capacity online, which we expect in 2015, to be able to provide not only for the U.S. potentially, but certainly for Europe and other markets. ","So we are pleased with where we are at from a capacity standpoint and the flexibility we are going to have going forward and again, from a price perspective, I think largely in-line with our expectations. ","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened. ","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ludwig, one question for you. Just to clarify, you kind of framed the (inaudible) impact as kind of high single digits in the U.S. I guess just to clarify, is that high single-digit market share in the second half or is that average over the whole year or is that actually in fact a worldwide impact? ","Ludwig Hantson","The single digit market share impact is for the U.S. and that is between now and the launch of 855.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Perfect, that's great. And Bob, one of the things, that just looking at the numbers and it's not a very insightful observation, but when you look at the renal business, it is so heavily ex-US. So could you just broadly speak about the opportunities in the U.S., now that Gambro is part of the fold?","Bob Parkinson","Yes. Bruce, some of this is consistent with my response earlier. It was to Rick Wise\u2019s question. For the first time over the last year or so, largely as a result of reimbursement changes and so on, we are seeing really a boost to our PD business. We look forward to that being augmented by the home HD launch, but there is a lot of things that now for the first time in the U.S. are actually driving consideration of treatment in the home, whether that is PD or HD, which is very exciting, because frankly the U.S. business as you know for us has been pretty lack luster over the last number of years, but as has been demonstrated, I think Bob Hombach cited some of the growth numbers for PD patients. We are really seeing that business get re-energized and again as I commented in my response earlier to Rick, we think that\u2019s going to be sustainable.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Thanks so much ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call with Baxter International. Thank you for participating and have a wonderful day. "]}}
