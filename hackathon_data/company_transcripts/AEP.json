At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. And I\u2019ll turn it over to your host, Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2016 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our Web site at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Okay, thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone. Thank you once again for joining AEP\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings call. AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share respectively, bringing the year-to-date earnings to $2.04 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.97 per share on an operating basis. This compares favorably to the second quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.88 per share.","The 2016 year-to-date earnings compare unfavorable to 2015 primarily driven by the significant weather and energy market differences experienced in the first quarter of 2015 versus first quarter 2016 as we reported last quarter. These results clearly keep us on pace to meet our operating earnings guidance range of 3.60 to 3.80 per share, which we are reaffirming. We\u2019re also reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate, so overall steady as she goes quarter with a discipline and consistency that our investors have come to expect from AEP.","Our focus on the utility operations, transmission growth, expansion of our customer sales channels, process optimization and the disciplined deployment of capital and O&M expense continues to drive positive results for our shareholders and customers. While externally it may appear to be a relatively calm quarter, there has been substantial activity internally that further demonstrates and direction of AEP and its strategy to be the next premium regulated utility.","We recently established a Chief Customer Officer role assumed by Bruce Evans our former AEP Texas President that provides a focus on improving our customer's experience. This organizational redesign will focus on addressing the evolving nexus that exists between the regulatory framework, emerging technologies that enhance the customer experience and deploying the analytics in technologies of the future to address resource needs and to optimize smart grid applications.","As we progress with the substantial build out of transmission and distribution to accommodate large scale optimization and renew of the grid along with the development of additional sales channels that provide growth, we are emerging as an energy company that provides solutions for our customers through both the classical regulated envelop that provides universal access and tailored solutions for customers. AEP's culture is one of openness, collaboration and innovation and I have no doubt that AEP when focus on the investments in the largest transmission system in the U.S. and the energy grid tomorrow will continue to evolve to be the next premium regulate energy company.","Also during the second quarter, we continue our strategic review as the comparative generation, keeping in mind we now have two tranches of generation, the first of which we\u2019ve called the non-PPA assets for lack of a better term, which essentially is the natural gas units and the Gavin coal station. The process for this tranche is going according to plan and continues beyond initial bids that were received in the second quarter with final bids due in August. I can say that the response has been robust and we are confident that the process will move toward the conclusion of the strategic review in the coming months.","We have also began the planning for the disposition of any cash proceeds to ensure an earnings trajectory that replaces lost earning as quickly as possible. This could include some ramp-up capital spending in transmission and other actions that we\u2019ve done previously and that the cause of immediate recognition of PTC benefits, one business we are currently ramping up is our investment in the long term solar arrangements as well. The second tranche, the previous referred to PPA assets or in the initial phase are preparing assets for process much like the non-PPA assets. This process will occur in parallel with our focused efforts toward restructuring in Ohio. We will be discussing these issues and implications in more detail during the coming months, leading up to November EEI.","To follow up on the Ohio restructuring discussion for those of you who don\u2019t know several of our company's sites have showing up in the latest craze of Pokemon Go. One of those sites was our turbine sitting in front of our 1 Riverside Plaza corporate headquarters, the virtual reality of a Pokemon next to our generator turbine in Ohio made me think that, it may be good for a game but if the generator was virtual we might have a real problem on our hands and that is where Ohio is heading if it depends too much on federal markets that do not value the long term base flow generation.","I want to look at PJM website, pjm.com to review the generation mix of the peak during the warm days we have been experiencing lately. The vast majority of capacity at the time of the peak is delivered by coal and nuclear resources that are not valued properly in the market construct. Moreover, these markets do not take in account the other issues that are of State concerned such as placing the generation, balance portfolios, jobs, taxes and other state issues.","These markets including PJM need to be improved to adjust to these realities. With FERC\u2019s order essentially taking the Ohio PPA proposal approved by the Ohio commission of the table, which I discuss last quarter, AEP is addressing the situation by pursuing restructuring in Ohio. Note this is restructuring, not re-regulation. Our proposal for legislation is now being discussed with various stakeholders and involves the ability or transfer existing generation and invest in new generation such as natural gas and renewables by AEP Ohio.","The proposed legislation strikes a balance between our ability to invest and maintain generation in the state and the customers\u2019 ability to choose generation suppliers. This overall process would allow AEP Ohio to move forward with the transition of generation resources in a responsible way that would benefit the State of Ohio and AEP and its customers. The legislation would address any potential FERC jurisdictional matters while allowing the state to take control of its own resources as well as any transition envisioned under initiatives such as the clean power plant.","In the absence of restructuring legislation, AEP will continue with its strategic process with the second tranche of generation. We continue to analyze the load situation our service territory shale gas load just tailed off in recent months along the course with mining while industrial load has dropped, commercial and residential load increased, so from quarter-to-quarter the last several years have overall been a mixed bag and hard to read, much like the economy in general. Brian will address the load related issues in more detail in a few minutes.","Moving to the equalizer chart on page four that shows our various operating areas, our overall ROE continues to improve as we mentioned last quarter, it's now at 9.8% versus 9.4% that we reported last quarter and still expect as a move toward our forecasted 10.1% overall ROE for 2016. So, all is moving according to plan. So here is the story for each of the regulated business units. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is at the end of the second quarter it was 13.3%. We expect it to be more favorable than the forecasted 11.9% at the end of the year. The improved ROE forecast is primarily due to AEP Ohio receiving a regulatory order related to the PIR, the phase in recovery writer that allows us to recover accumulated deferred fuel costs with carrying charges as approved by the commission in the ESP 1 case and also 21 million increase in retail margins due to our regulatory reversal and a provision that occurred and then a favorable annual PJM transmission formally rated through us.","So AEP Co Ohio Power is doing very well at this point and we continue to expect. AEP Co, the increased ROE is primarily due to a one-time recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the public service commission of West Virginia in June of 2016. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included delayed billing of 25 million of the annual base rate increase for residential customers until July 2016 as these revenues phase in the company\u2019s ROE is expected to trend near the 2016 forecasted ROE. AEP Co does continue to monitor reductions in industrial and residential load, particularly in the cold depressed areas of the state, we\u2019re watching that very closely.","Kentucky Power we\u2019re seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized a 45 million rate increase effective July 2015 and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE in 2016. And also they are continuing to watch their economy as well. I&M achieved an ROE of 10.1%. I&M continues to benefit from reasonable regulatory frameworks in place for those major capital investment programs that we have in the state generation such as Rockport, the solar projects, nuclear with a loss cycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016.","PSO its ROE is generally aligned with expectations, Oklahoma\u2019s economy continues to experience a slow down due in large part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December 2015 the Oklahoma Corporation commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of 75 million subject to refund in January of 2016. So final commission order as expected on that in the fourth quarter.","SWEPCO 2016 revenues were challenged by the weakness in oil and natural gas price system, wholesale revenue is rolling off, also wholesale customer's exercise options for sell generation or market participation, but we filed an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24th, to recover our retrofit investments at Welsh and Flint Creek and then in Texas we filed Transmission & Distribution writers there as well in that state. So we continue to make various filings in those states to improve the ROE.","In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment, AEP Texas to serve higher levels of electric load and maintain the reliability of the grid had gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. The ROE should continue to improve however due to the recently approved $56 million DCRF settlement that will going into effect September 1, 2016. And that\u2019s a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, for those of you who don\u2019t know what DCRF is. AEP Transmission Hold Co, the transmission Hold Co's return of 11.7% is outperforming the 2016 forecast of 10.2%, the increase in ROE is really focused on a true up, an annual true up that occurs in the transmission formula. So we expect that ROE to come down during the year, but still expect it to be around 10.7% by year end. So that\u2019s a known and measurable processes that we\u2019re going through there. So overall, 9.8% continues to track upward and we are pleased with the progress that the operating companies have made.","So overall, another great quarter for AEP, this quarter has been a continued approached by AEP to ensure consistency discipline and execution to provide quality shareholder value. It's hard for anyone from outside of AEP to see the company I see from inside with the dedication and innovation of our approximately 18,000 employees. So I\u2019ll just put it this way, I happen to play drums in a band at an event in Cleveland last week where we backed up the Marshal Tucker Band. We played some Bruce Springsteen and it's still on my mind, so I\u2019ll just end up by just saying, Baby we were born to run.","Brian?","Brian Tierney","Thank you Boss and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll take you through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide our latest insight on loan and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position.","Turning to Slide 5, operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share or $466 million, compared to $0.88 per share, $429 million in 2015. Overall the increase in earnings was driven by rate changes including the reversal of our regulatory provision and lower O&M in our regulated utilities, and higher earnings in our AEP transition Hold Co segment. Both of which were partially offset by the expected decline in the generation of marketing segment.","Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.42 per share in the second quarter to both 2016 and 2015. Lower O&M due to decreased planned outage expenses and recovery of incremental investment to save our customers were offset by lower margins on retail sales and decreased off-system sales margins due to lower energy prices. The transmission and distribution utility segment earn $0.25 per share for the quarter, up $0.09 from last year. This segment\u2019s major variances included the reversal of the previous regulatory provision in Ohio adding $0.03 per share, and higher margins on retail sales which added $0.02 per share. Other favorable drivers each adding a penny per share where rate changes higher ERCOT transmission revenue and lower O&M expense.","Our AEP transmission Hold Co segment continues to grow contributing $0.19 per share or the quarter, an improvement of $0.06. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment and includes the impact of the annual true up for the formula rate mechanism. Net plant investment less deferred taxes grew by approximately $840 million, an increase of 32% since last June. The generation of marketing segment produced earnings of $0.09 per share down $0.07 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.07 due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio to full market pricing.","Energy margins were lower by $0.03 per share due to power prices liquidating 18% lower than last year. On the positive side, the commercial organization in our competitive business performed well and wholesale trading and marketing was favorable by a penny this quarter. Corporate and other was down a penny from last year due to higher O&M expense.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6, and I will briefly highlight our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $967 million compared to $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion in 2015. The details are on the slides for those of you who\u2019d like it, but overall the decrease in earnings was driven by the expected decline in earnings in the generation of marketing segment, less favorable weather conditions in the first quarter, depressed power prices and the disposition of our river business last year. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, a change in the effective tax rate, growth in normalized margin and increased earnings in our transmission businesses.","Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 7 to review normalized load performance. For both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons the message is the same. Our normalized retail sales were down compared to last year because the increase in residential and commercial sales was more than offset by the drop in industrial load. In the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter and 0.3% year-to-date. For both periods, the strong sales performance in our Texas territory is being offset by weakness in the Appalachian and Kentucky regions. This illustrates the benefit of geographic diversity.","Normalized residential sales in the upper left rebounded in the second quarter and are now essentially flat compared to last year. Through the first half of 2016 our residential sales, customer accounts and normalized usage were all essentially flat. In the upper right commercial sales grew by 1% for the quarter and are up 0.8% year-to-date. This growth was spread across several of our operating companies, although the strongest growth occurred with the T&B utility segment. This is consistent with some of the economic data I will share with you on the next slide.","Finally industrial sales dropped by 4% this quarter and are down 1.6% through June. The sustained drop in energy prices, weak global demand and strong dollar have combined to form a challenging environment for manufacturers. For the quarter industrial sales declined in seven of our top 10 industrial sectors. The two sectors that grew in the second quarter were pipeline transportation and transportation equipment manufacturing. The petroleum and coal product sector was flat for the quarter. I\u2019ll provide additional color on our industrial sales later.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, the estimated 1.3% growth for AEP is only 0.3% behind U.S. The upper right chart shows that our Eastern territory is not only growing faster than our Western territory but is now exceeding the U.S. This is not the case for our Western territory where there is greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices.","Depressed energy prices have created a noticeable slowing in our western footprint.","While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing an impact of lost jobs. The charts at the bottom show that employment growth for AEP is holding steady of 1.1%, but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is not surprising the job growth in AEP's eastern territory exceeds the west given what we just discussed.","Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that our commercial sales were the strongest in our community utility segment that matches the employment data for our service territory as well. Over two thirds of all jobs added in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas. The sector is showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality, and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 22,000 fewer employees in that second than last year and approximately 15,000 of those jobs were located in our western footprint.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review our industrial sales trends by region. Over the last several years our industrial sales growth has largely been tied to oil and gas activity around the major share plays. Up and to this quarter, sales to the oil and gas sectors have been fairly resilient despite low energy prices. The chart in the upper left shows that the tide has started to turn. AEP's industrial sales in shale counties this quarter actually decline by 0.3%. Specifically the decline is largely coming from our upstream oil and gas extraction sector which experience to 6% decline for the quarter.","The map on the right identifies our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we continue to see significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer accounts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down 14% for this quarter, while sales to the mining sector alone were down nearly 18%. Low natural gas prices, environmental regulations, lowered demand from the utility sector and less demand globally from metallurgical coal have created a bad situation for Appalachian coal producers. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were down 3.3% for the quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 10 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our total debt to capital ratio crept up by 0.3% during the quarter and remains healthy at 54%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO-to-debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.6 times and 20.2% respectively. Our qualified pension funding remained unchanged for the quarter at 97%, although plant assets increased during the quarter, so did plant liabilities due to discount rate coming in lower than assumed. During the month of June we funded about $86 million to plant assets and amount equal to the estimate of service cost for the year.","Our OPEB funding now stands at 101%. Plant assets increased by 0.2% but plant liabilities increased 3.1% due to drop in discount rate. The overall impact dropped our OPEB funding ratio by 2.9%. The estimated after tax O&M expense for both plans this year is expected to be about $13 million.","Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.3 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, our treasury team worked with our banking partners to amend and extend our key credit facilities. We now have a $3 million facility that extends into June of 2021 and the second $500 million facility that expires in June of 2018. This tiered structure allows for maximum flexibility as we continue our strategic review of our competitive generation assets. Altogether, AEP\u2019s balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions.","Now let's turn to slide 11 and wrap this up, so we can get to your questions. We are pleased with our earnings results for the second quarter of this year. Gains in our wires businesses more than offset expected decreases in our competitive businesses due to lower energy prices and deregulation in Ohio. As we look towards the second half of 2016, we believe that our regulated businesses will more than offset any challenges presented by our generation and marketing segment, giving us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share.","Finally, as Nick mentioned earlier, the strategic review of our competitive generation remains on track and we hope to have news for you in that regard either later this quarter or early next quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore Finance. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Looking at the numbers, the quarter was obviously great, but the sales trends in industrial are a bit concerning especially if you just extrapolate them out, on a compounding basis. I\u2019ve heard some concern from investors just around the ability to meet the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration if in fact the sales growth targets that you laid out when you laid that target out a year or so ago failed to materialize. Sort of you aspired to a premium utility, the premium utilities don\u2019t blame changes in the outlook for not meeting their growth rates. So, how do you aspire to a nice plan to time if industrial sales continue to be a drag on the plant?","Nick Akins","I think the last four years have shown a couple of things, one is the inconsistency of load from quarter-to-quarter and obviously we\u2019ve had to work through that. I think the other thing in the last four years has shown us we have to adjust to it. And when you think about the levers that we have around O&M, but also have emerging revenue sides as well. I mean the transmission continues to pick up, there is no question. We\u2019ll have to continue to invest in the grid, in particular transmission as well. And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well.","So I think when you look at the 4% to 6% we\u2019re still confident in the 4% to 6%. And as we go through the year we\u2019ll certainly be able to fine tune that in more detail, but I guess the overall message is we feel like we have the ability as we\u2019ve done in the last four years to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur. And there is no question, I mean, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like, but also they got to look at the revenue side as well and ensure that we\u2019re doing everything we can do there to do its work as well.","So Greg I know there is a lot of concern out there about load forecast going forward, if we trend it out. And of course what we do to irregular generation, but at the end of the day we are going to adjust to it And I think we take very seriously the consistency that we\u2019ve build and maintained over the last four years and we don\u2019t interim on giving that up.","Greg Gordon","All right, that\u2019s great. Also when I look at the balance sheet, you guys have sort of ascended to a position of having one of the strongest parent balance sheet amongst what I consider your utility holding company peers, if you look at the FFO-to-debt metrics, to debt EBITDA and that. You\u2019ve got a lot of balance sheet capacity. How do you think about that store value and how you might use it going forward?","Nick Akins","Yes, we look at stored value, it's gives us a lot of opportunity, but we have the ability to invest indigenously within our own footprint and we also from a transmission standpoint and other revenue producers that we\u2019re working on to really define that, whether it's an energy company of the future or whatever you want to call it. But there is no doubt that we have built up a strong balance sheet with great credit metrics. And obviously we intend on maintaining that but at the same time there is the ability for us to look at various options for the use of that debt. And it's actually a good place to be in, but also in this day and age and how the economy of doing and what's going on there it's a good place to be.","Brian Tierney","Gregg, you know this management and you know how we use that balance sheet capacity in the past. It's been on prudent regulator type utility investments and I think you\u2019d expect us to spend any of our balance sheet capacity on a similar way going forward.","Greg Gordon","Great thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","Just two questions, first question I guess on Ohio, you\u2019ve had another utility in your state apply for regulated plan. Looks like it\u2019s going to be a wires charge to grow got to make a more of a robust grade. Does AEP make a similar filing giving that staff has recommended that?","Nick Akins","Yes, ultimately we can also do that, I think that\u2019s an option for us to do. But AEP is sort in a different place. We have some outstanding issues, that we\u2019re working through with the commission, the perk [ph] that we just got was one of those. But we also have the Supreme Court cases on capacity, they will come back, and on the RSR. So we are working through a rest of outstanding issues and each one of those is generally positive for AEP.","So we want to work through those and get them resolve, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do that. And at the end of the day, if that other companies are successful then obviously we will take a hard look at that. But we want to make sure that we are investing in this state and those areas that make sense and we are doing it well from a transmission and distribution perspective. We\u2019ve got to get this generation things settled once in for all.","Anthony Crowdell","And then following up on Gregg's question, you mentioned you guys have a strong balance sheet, highlighted all of that capacity have, you\u2019re going through the changes of the generation and marketing segment right now. Southern\u2019s call yesterday highlight the success at Southern Power, refining all these renewable projects. Do we see the generation marketing business for AEP in the year or two looking more like a southern power with a lot more renewables, is that going to be the focus as we go forward? Or is it just really managing the fleet or just winding it down and adjusting the wires company or regulated company?","Nick Akins","No, I think clearly and we\u2019re probably little more quiet about it because the major part of our business is around infrastructure, infrastructure development on the transmission side. We have a huge transmission system, so we have a lot of ability to invest. But you\u2019re always looking for sources of new revenue and we see it as another tool in the tool box to be able to focus on enhancements of earnings because obviously there is near term benefits of a protection tax credits, and we\u2019re after doing that. ","We just did a universal scale or utility scale project in Utah that hasn\u2019t been announced yet. We can\u2019t say who but it's a 20 megawatt project. And then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country. And we\u2019ve been doing that and we know how to do that.","What we really are focused on though is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the wisest fashion and that can certainly augment our business, but our main focus is the focus on the infrastructure and what it means. And it goes beyond solar. It goes to relationships with customers and I sort of alluded that in my opening discussion, we have a much broader relationship with some of these customers that goes beyond solar, it goes to obviously renewables with storage. We\u2019re very focused on storage aspect.","Our investor in Greensmith for example, integration of solar and wind, but also in energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that\u2019s going to be a huge benefit to us.","So, obviously we want to be in the solar business, but we also going to be in the wind power business, it's really addressing tailored needs of customers focused around that customer experience. And so in an ancillary fashion it's coming to pass, but we\u2019ll probably be getting larger at it, but we\u2019ll good at it and we\u2019ll be focused on ultimately those customer experience side of things.","Anthony Crowdell","My last thing is, just to make sure I understand this correctly, it looks like you\u2019ll look at multiple opportunities, maybe to bridge the gap on GenCore [ph] marketing and one of those maybe like a solar ITC bridge there. Is that correct, or that\u2019s not what you said?","Nick Akins","Yes, essentially that\u2019s right. But at the same time we want the earnings driven by the utility business to drive that consistency. Well, if you\u2019re able to augment with long-term purchase power arrangements, whether it's solar or whether it's anything else then it's qasai regulated that we can show consistency and that\u2019s what we -- that\u2019s the first thing we measured on.","So we\u2019re not out there doing solar just for solar sake or solar with counterparties that we\u2019re not sure that they\u2019re going to be there or not. We\u2019re being very selective about what solar projects and what counterparties we become involved with and I think and certainly Chuck Zebula who is running that business, I think probably all know him, he is very structured in the way he addresses these things just like he did with even a lot of this un-regulated generation.","We performed extremely well in doing that business regardless of whether we should be in it or not, that\u2019s another question. But when we do it, it's very disciplined, it's very structured and it's very focused on what we are trying to achieve. So you\u2019re exactly right. For us -- I mean if you look at the use of proceeds, if we have catch proceeds coming in from a transaction, then obviously one of the issues that we talked about earlier was repurchase of stock. But obviously if you can invest in a long term solar project and take the PTCs upfront, that\u2019s also a great measure for investment as oppose to buying back stock. So there is a lot of thing that are on the table that we\u2019re preparing as we work through the process of that disposition of cash for example.","So I think to be the energy company of the future, you\u2019ve got to be involved with all these facets of the business and understand that facet of the business, but you got to be very disciplined in your approach. And we just have a -- I wouldn\u2019t say a different view in terms of whether all of these resources, there should be a balance at our resources, we agree on that. I think the issue is we are very focused on the wires piece of it and how it interacts with the customer and in the future you are going to see a lot of these distributed solutions that are driven by the customer interaction at the distribution level and we are going to be there to do it.","Anthony Crowdell","Great thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from line of Julien Dumoulin Smith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","So quick follow up if you will on the just process here, when you thinking about the legislative effort whether restructuring or what have you, when do you make a final call here? You kind of talked about it in this quarter, early next kind of making a vision on the sale. Is this the potential for you to stretch in next year to try to get it done given kind of the limited window on legislation this year?","Nick Akins","Yes, let me give you an idea of this my perception of the timing. We have the framework of legislature that we\u2019re addressing with stakeholders now and that\u2019s -- whether it's legislature, whether it's other that are important to in discussion process, other participants in the market, those kinds of things. We are going to focus on that between now and November. And then November is when the Ohio legislature comes back into place. And keep in mind, I am talking about the first tranche of assets, this is really regarding the second tranche which is, what formally was the PPA assets.","So the first tranche, that\u2019s moving along, it's already -- the train\u2019s left the station and it\u2019s moving forward. The second tranche, I am saying from the restructuring standpoint, we\u2019re going to go through and have the legislature and have discussions with stakeholders to get that process in place in November when Ohio, the legislature comes back into session. It will be a lame-duck session. So we will have to make sure that we focused on those legislatures that will still be around and the future leaders of that organization. And then that way we can hit the ground running with legislature that\u2019s already been by and large embedded and discussed in the first quarter by the first of the year.","So in the first quarter you\u2019re starting with the new legislature, I think we going to know pretty quickly whether people are open to the possibility of this kind of thing happening or not. And at that point in time, we have already started our secondary process as I talked about around the PPA assets, getting the data room ready, all that kind of stuff. And we\u2019ll make a determination of where we think Ohio is going to go. Ohio many people didn\u2019t think the PPA would happen in Ohio and it did happened. And I still think there is going to be some form of restructuring in Ohio because there has to be. But the question becomes; number one, are people receptive to it; number two, is the time frame appropriate for what we\u2019re trying to achieve.","The driver here will be that secondary process and we\u2019ll have to get some determination as to whether the openness and the collaboration in the State of Ohio would work to get something done during the pendency of all that. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. And so when we think about that you\u2019re probably taking the decisional process in the first quarter of next year that we\u2019ll know whether Ohio if there is a chance of moving forward with that thing or not. And so that will tell us what we need to know.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","And then just to keep going with that continue, you kind of alluded to new investment as well. And I am just curious, even if you pursue the sales do you pursue legislation next year to open that door as well? And to that end what kind of generation and how do you envision that today?","Nick Akins","I\u2019ve made it very clear in the state that we\u2019re not going to investment in the generation in this state, period. Until something is resolved from restructuring standpoint that enables us to invest and do it in a wise fashion. And the legislation includes the ability for AEP Ohio to not only transfer those assets that were under the PPA to AEP Ohio, but also to be able to have a mechanism for investment in future generation. And obviously the State of Ohio is very interested in getting natural gas going. There is a lot of discussion about -- there is three or four natural gas units getting built, but that\u2019s locally inadequate of what the Ohio load actually is.","And so there is a capacity deficiency in Ohio and if Ohio wants to take advantage of additional natural gas build out, the additional structural addition such as pipeline infrastructure, electric transmission infrastructure, the economic development follow-on to all of that, there is no reason for Ohio to give that up and so there has to be a mechanism to do that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re after.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","And just to clarify, is renewables as well in the legislation, and obviously kind of a hot issue this year?","Nick Akins","Yes renewables as well and we\u2019ve had discussions, some -- there is different opinion on when, there is different opinions on solar, most are for solar, some are against wind. But I think there is dialogs to where we can probably reach some happy medium.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Just a follow up to Julien\u2019s question, you had mentioned that this is not reregulation restructuring and I am just curious about what the -- why the de-emphasis on reregulation and what pushed back do to you see if that term was used or proposed?","Nick Akins","I think reregulation has the kind connotation that everything is going to be slammed back into the wires company and there won\u2019t be any ability to shop and other participants can\u2019t participate in a market. So we are focused on reaching that balance of the ability for the utility to invest, but also others to invest as well, and customers to be able to. So that\u2019s really the distinction. Re-regulation just as a large to the connotation to it and it actually is a much heavier lift to put entire Genie back in the bottle.","Michael Weinstein","Right, so I guess it's a spectrum of possible options, one where you can have everything put in, one where we you have only certain assets like the PPA assets and then perhaps maybe on the other hand of the spectrum might be only -- to allow the utilities only to invest in new asset. I know that\u2019s something and might happen?","Nick Akins","Well, that\u2019s not our preference obviously. And that\u2019s going to be determined on the second tranche of generation for sure. Our intension is to make sure that we can transfer these assets back into the large company, and enable the ability for to continue to invest in new generation in a creatable fashion. And it will take a legislative mechanism to do that and we also obviously want to make sure that we accommodate other participants in the market in some fashion and that\u2019s part of dialogue. But those two things are what we\u2019re after.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, as a reinvestment possibility of the solar investments that you were talking about. How big do you see that getting in terms of contributing to the 4% to 6% growth rate and versus let's say the transmission Hold Co growth that you are forecasting for that segment?","Nick Akins","Yes, so we plan on updating that at EEI in November, particularly as it relates to \u201917 and beyond. We know where it is for this year and it's been pretty good. It's a -- 15 million to 20 million has been added for this year, so those projects is a the huge pipeline of projects and I think you\u2019ve probably heard others talk about, there is a lot of solar projects out there but we are going to pick and choose the ones that match up to what our degree of risk is, and we want to make sure that that business continues to grow, but we are going to be very disciplined in order to approach. So we will have more on that at EEI in November.","Michael Weinstein","Great, look forward to see. Thank you.","Nick Akins","And it's not that -- it's what we\u2019re doing with wind power and with energy storage as well. And it could be even more defined energy service relationships as well.","Michael Weinstein","Right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Just in terms of tax audit, could you elaborate a little more what happened there, and if it's going to maybe impact tax rate going forward?","Brian Tierney","Yes, so it's should not impact tax rates going forward at all. So it was a favorable federal tax adjustment related to a settlement of a federal tax audit issue, where we had a tax valuation allowance recorded in 2011. And talk about how is legacy an issue, this is -- that was related to litigation that stemmed out of the Enron bankruptcy.","So we are going back pretty far in history, these things take a long time to work their way through the IRS and ultimately a congressional committee and that\u2019s what happen on this, so it's great to get that resolved and behind us, but don\u2019t expect anything like that to be a recurring item.","Paul Patterson","And then on the reregulation or restructuring. Just to make sure I understand, it sounds like you\u2019ll be in a -- I wasn\u2019t clear as to whether or not November, the Lame-duck session was when things might be clear to you? Or what that meant in terms of whether something actually might happen then, or whether you\u2019re really looking at the first quarter of 2017?","Nick Akins","So I am thinking -- okay. So it really is more of a soaking period because what we want to do is in November we\u2019re talking to the other stakeholders and come to the legislature with what we believe is a balanced package that other participants in the market can latch onto as well. If we do that then the discussion we\u2019ve already had with legislators, we\u2019re trying to get to every legislator we can, that we know is going to still be around and then that would be -- November we\u2019ll get an early indication of where things are going. But really nothing -- I am not expecting anything can happen until the first of the year when the new legislature comes in.","But obviously we\u2019ll know who is coming in, so we can have that soaking period from November to December and then in earnest move that legislation forward. I know that\u2019s aggressive but what we\u2019ll be looking for is really the feedback that we get in terms of not only whether it can get done or not but in terms of timing, it will be an important consideration for us. So, I don\u2019t see legislation actually getting done until first quarter or second quarter of next year. But if we know it's coming and we know what\u2019s entailed in it, then we can plan for it.","Paul Patterson","And then when you mentioned stakeholders, are we talking about other merchant generators and the reason for the question is that, as you know it seems that unless their generation is included or what have you, that there is this sort of -- we emit [ph] sort of take no prisoners like no, no, no, no, no, on anything like restructuring or what have you because of the fear that they might not be as competitive if you follow me? Is your participation something critical here, or how should we think about the stakeholder [indiscernible] you mentioned?","Nick Akins","I certainly think that they are part of the equation and certainly we want to be able to accommodate as much as we can, the investments that have been made in the stake of some of these independent power producers. And keep in mind I mean they can still have PPAs because they\u2019re not affiliated, so there are opportunities for them to actually confirm earnings in the period where obviously being an independent power producer is not a good time to be in that business right now. So, I am not going to go into who we\u2019ve been having discussions with or anything like that, but I would have to say that they are an important part of the puzzle here.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Can you just once again review the priorities for the proceeds from the non-PPA assets?","Nick Akins","The proceeds for the non-PPA assets -- so that process will go forward and the priority will be, we will look at as much ramping up as we can do relative to transmission investment and another types of investments to fill -- to make sure that the earnings come in as quickly as possible. Obviously solar could be a piece of that as well. And we are obviously looking at other measures that we can do to invest more quickly to address the level of cash that\u2019s coming in. So we will obviously fill in more of the detail of that in November as well.","Brian Tierney","Paul, we would like to be able to come out and have an Analyst Day when we do have something to announce on that strategic review that\u2019s underway and we would have a discussion of that that time.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you and you indicated that the process is proceeding fairly -- I think you characterized its going well. Can we use kind of duke Ohio assets on dollar-per-kilowatt basis, is that kind of -- is that a reasonable proxy?","Nick Akins","Paul, I don\u2019t want to tell which ones -- which assets to use, I think with your knowledge of the industry you could probably come up with something that would be reasonable for what those would be, other have, somewhat missed it terribly. But I think the smarter people like you in the industry can figure it out pretty readily.","Brian Tierney","I think, as I mentioned early we have a robust set of bidders, so I hate to give a mini guidance at this point.","Paul Ridzon","Understood. And that\u2019s 5,000 megawatts from non-PPA?","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Just clarity on timing of the non-PPA outcome?","Nick Akins","So from a non-PPA piece, as we get final bids in August, it will probably take -- it could be third quarter early fourth quarter to have a completed deal that we would announce at that point in time. And then the process would occur relative to closing and that could fall into 2017, but obviously the deal will done and we\u2019ll get to closing. So in likely it will take -- once the deal is done, it's could take around six months, maybe nine months to actually close.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then also just you mentioned kind of some of weakness in your coal country subsidiary facilities, and are you planning to get rereleased in those areas or given that they\u2019re depressed, like is there other ways that you might be able to find solution there? [Multiple speakers] doesn\u2019t seem like the politicians want to find a way to invest in new things in these areas? So I am just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that.","Nick Akins","Paul there are couple of things going out -- I am sorry Steve, in Kentucky in particularly we just had some rate relief and we are looking at when it makes sense for us to go back. But in Kentucky in particular to governor\u2019s office is looking at ways to trying track a new businesses and retain the businesses in those areas that are negatively impacted by what\u2019s happening with coal and we from an economic development perspective are certainly working with the governor and the state legislators to try and see we can be a productive part of that.","Nick Akins","And Steve keep in mind too we\u2019ve converted some of the coal to natural gas as well. So the big Sandy side is converted to natural gas, Clint Rivers is converted to natural gas. Those are operational now and you\u2019ll probably see more natural gas build out, but also on the renewable side you will continue to see expansion from that perspective. And as Brian mentioned we\u2019re actually have been working, our economic development people have been working with the states to present these sites as brownfield sites for manufacturing and industrial. So we\u2019re working to try to reinforce those service territories as much as we possibly can.","Steve Fleishman","Thanks.","Nick Akins","I\u2019d say though that there is a -- I mean a lot of damage that\u2019s been done to coal country, there is no question about it. And whoever gets elected in this process really needs to focus one way or another on reinforcing a hugely depressed area. And each one of them has their own way. I mean Hillary Clinton wants just do several billion, focused on rehabilitating from a jobs perspective and that kind of thing. That seems like a longer term issue. And of course Donald Trump is on the other side saying he\u2019s putting the miners back to work and I don\u2019t know exactly how that works. But either way I think both of them, they really ought to be focused on reinvigorating that part of the country, since it's been so devastated by what\u2019s happened recently.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more call. One more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Just to bring closure to the overall merger portfolio the exit here. So if I am hearing you right, the non-PPA assets announced late Q3, early Q4 takes six to nine months to close from there. The PPA assets, will you have something to announce in Q1 or are you going to follow the legislative process and maybe that spins over into Q2, not wide clear on when the final closure happens on that portfolio?","Nick Akins","I think you read that right. We\u2019re going to have to gauge the receptivity from the legislature that comes into play at that point in time and we\u2019ll have a lot of groundwork already done. So we\u2019ll have a good feeling I think about first quarter or where this is going to go. Now, if it -- and keep in mind that second tranche is continuing in parallel. So, we\u2019re not slowing down on that. What we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re going to gauge that first quarter and you may get an announcement from us that if we\u2019re not sensing that it's going in the right direction in Ohio then we\u2019ll say we\u2019ve got the second tranches, it\u2019s moving along and we\u2019ll give an update to that.","If we see that legislation can get done then there will be an expectation to get that legislation done as quickly as possible, but we\u2019ll have to continue, we\u2019re in the tranches until we know for sure that legislation is going to happen. So, I would say you\u2019re going to hear something from us first quarter, perhaps the beginning of second quarter, but I believe in first quarter you will hear from us, some very significant policy around that.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then second, given on a low trends have played out through the first half, are you still sticking to the plus 0.9% target for the year, or should be adjusting that?","Brian Tierney","As we do an update, being half through the year and looking at where we have been year-to-date. We anticipate being closer to flat by yearend versus 2015.","Ali Agha","Okay. And last question, when we look at the transmission growth profile you have led for us the Trans Co business for 2019, that\u2019s going well above 4% to 6%, it's becoming a bigger piece of your overall earnings as well. So when you look at this company beyond the mergers, so just on a regulated basis, and if your PNB et cetera grows pretty much in line with everybody and the transmission grows the way it is, might we be looking at an overall portfolio that has a growth rate north of 4% to 6% just looking at those kind of numbers?","Nick Akins","So we are going to provide a more fulsome update on longer term growth rate when we will get together after the announcement of the conclusion of the strategic review of the asset. We would like to have an Analyst Day when we go into all that, sort of reset growth rate if it's time to that and take a look at use of proceeds if that\u2019s what we\u2019re facing at that time and give you more fulsome view hopefully later this -- in the autumn this year.","Nick Akins","So without answering, which we\u2019ll answer obviously later in the year as Brian said. We have really, we\u2019ve really brought up the kind of company this is going to be in the future and that will be one driven by transmission, distribution, focus on wares and the convolution of resources and energy services associated with that. So it's going to be a very, very good company going forward from a consistency basis, but also from an investment standpoint and what we\u2019re are investing in. I think it will position us very well for the next 100 years.","Ali Agha","Right. The regular business should pretty much be growing with your rate base investment, is that fair?","Nick Akins","That\u2019s fair.","Ali Agha","Okay, thank you.","Bette Jo Rozsa","And thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any additional question you may have. Sean, would you please give the replay information?","Operator","Yes, thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Lois. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2017 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AEP's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Once again this quarter, AEP released earnings that are on track for the year despite very mild spring weather. In fact, along with first quarter results where winter was also mild, the weather has impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share year-to-date versus normal, but we're still on budget to meet our earnings guidance for the year.","As you know, we recognized the mild weather early on in the year and adjusted our O&M spending to compensate for the possibility of mild weather impacts. So again, we actually continue to be on budget with our projection for the midpoint of guidance. So we confirm our existing 2017 operating guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share.","We reported GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $0.76 per share and $0.75 per share, respectively, versus second quarter 2016 GAAP and operating earnings of $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share, respectively. For the year-to-date, that brings 2017 year-to-date to GAAP and operating earnings of $1.97 per share and $1.72 per share, respectively, versus 2016 year-to-date of $2.04 per share of GAAP and $1.97 per share of operating earnings.","This year, comparing 2017 to 2016 is like comparing apples to oranges. We're a different company centered on regulated operations and investments without significant unregulated operations, as in 2016, and have effectively de-risked the company and really focused on our earnings growth trajectory of 5% to 7% in the future. Nothing has changed for AEP in its view of achieving our 2017 guidance as a foundation for future growth.","Since football season is upon us, as Tom Landry, the famous coach of the Dallas Cowboys, once said, confidence comes from knowing what you're doing. If you're prepared for something, you usually do it; if not, you usually fall flat on your face.","AEP is confident. We know what we're doing and we are prepared. We're on track, again, for guidance, and the fundamentals, as we will talk about later, are strong. So our headline is guidance confirmed, fundamentals getting stronger despite the weather.","Just to reiterate the point regarding mild weather year-to-date for the second quarter, our heating degree days \u2013 and you'll see that in the 10-Q on the registrant. So we're significantly below normal, making the quarter the second mildest in the last 30 years. When taking into account the first quarter as well, 2017 year-to-date has been the mildest year based upon heating degree days in the last 30 years. That being said, from the load perspective, Brian will be getting this in more detail a bit later, but we're pleased with the strong industrial load performance this quarter in almost all sectors that if this trend continues will bode well for commercial and residential pick-ups in the future.","Moving through some of the areas of interest this quarter, I'm sure you all saw the announcement yesterday regarding the Wind Catcher Energy Connection project, a proposed and substantial renewables project that would ultimately serve our AEP SWEPCO and PSO customers in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. This project has been almost a year in the making and is in the developmental stages with filings to be made in these four state jurisdictions asking for approval to develop, construct and own 2000 megawatts of high efficiency and capacity factor wind resources along with our approximately 350-mile 765 KV transmission line that serves as a generation interconnect to connect the resources to serve PSO and SWEPCO customers. The estimated cost of the project is approximately $4.5 billion, including AFUDC, and ownership is split between SWEPCO and PSO 70%\/30%, respectively.","The beauty of this project is severalfold. It benefits \u2013 number one, it benefits customers by approximately $7 billion over the 25-year life, $2.7 billion on a present value basis. Number two, it will boost economic growth in the region where the jobs, taxes, royalties and economic development follow-on effects will be considerable. Three, it provides further diversification of generation resources by using indigenous high quality resources in the region, mitigating fuel and congestion risk for consumers as well. And it also provides AEP investors with the opportunity for earnings growth as a result.","This project is not presently in our capital plan because the various commissions need time for review, but this is a great project and I'm happy to see Commissioner Foster Campbell in Louisiana and the Governor Hutchison of Arkansas already make statements of support. Looking at the benefits to all of this project, this project should be a no-brainer.","Moving on to other subjects, AEP's operating companies are in the midst of several rate cases; five, if you include the Ohio ESP. I'll cover these in more detail up front before we get to the general discussion with the equalizer graph. At SWEPCO, the Texas base case that was filed December of 2016 concluded its hearings in June. The net revenue request of $69 million with a requested ROE of 10% rate basing of Welsh, Pirkey, Flint Creek and Dolet Hills environmental controls retrofits along with recovery of the remaining Welsh 2 net book balance and an increasing SBP cost are the main drivers there. We expect an order in November with rates retroactively applied from May of 2017.","I&M is working on base cases in both Michigan and Indiana. The Michigan case filed in May included a $51.7 million net revenue request, while the Indiana rate case, which was filed yesterday, included a $263 million net revenue request. Both cases requested a 10.6% ROE. Key drivers of these cases are increase in rate base not covered by riders, loss of wholesale customer load, and a request to accelerate depreciation of Rockport. New rates are expected to be effective in March of 2018 for Michigan and July of 2018 for Indiana.","AEP Ohio is seeking to extend their ESP, which is currently set to expire in May of 2018, to 2024. Key issues of the case include increasing the cap on the distribution investment rider to account for the longer period of investment, funding for a four-year trim cycle and some grid modernization activities. Settlement discussions are ongoing and appear to be productive.","PSO filed a rate base case in June requesting a net revenue increase of $156 million and an ROE of 10%. Major drivers in that case include rate basing of environmental controls installed at Northeastern and Comanche for Environmental Compliance, and the PSO conversion to basically 100% AMI meters. Other items include increased depreciation rates, and also SPP transmission charges as well. We expect rates to be effective in January of 2018 as a result of this case.","And regarding Kentucky, Kentucky Power filed a base case in June requesting a revenue increase of $65 million with an ROE of 10.3%. This case is primarily driven by load loss and other increases in rate base, and rates are expected to be effective in January of 2018. So all in all, these five cases amount to over $500 million in revenue increases; so, a substantial year for AEP to progress along the lines of improving the ROEs in these various jurisdictions.","Updating on a few other items, in May the rationalization of our competitive generation business in Ohio continued with the sale of our share of the Zimmer Plant 330-megawatts to Dynegy and our corresponding purchase of Dynegy's share of Conesville Unit 4, which is 312 megawatts. This sale and purchase resulted in consolidating the ownership of each unit with its respective operator, enabling better planning and decision making around each unit. Also, consistent with our filing with the court regarding amendment to the NSR Consent Decree, AEP has proposed to retire Units 5 and 6 at Conesville, 800 megawatts in total, no later than the end of 2022. This will ultimately take our Ohio fleet down to just two coal-fired units after the retirement of Stuart Station, 600 megawatts, next year and the acceptance of our proposal to retire Conesville 5 and 6 by the end of 2022. The remaining two units are Conesville Unit 4, which is 650 megawatts, and Cardinal Unit 1, 595 megawatts, for a total of about 1250 megawatts. We continue to explore strategic alternatives for these remaining two units in Ohio.","Our competitive renewables business continues to grow at a pace consistent with our messaging to you last fall, where we announced plans to invest $1 billion in contracted renewables over the next three years. As an update, AEP Renewables recently acquired the interest in a 28-megawatt solar project in California which supplies energy to a 20-year PPA with an investment grade utility. Also, AEP OnSite Partners continues to see its opportunities grow with a number of smaller-scale solar projects in construction in the pipeline. Between these two entities, we have committed $360 million in projects so far, and we continue to look for opportunities that are consistent with our disciplined return requirements and tolerance for risk.","So regarding the proposed Ohio legislation, moving on to that, in an effort to ensure long-term generation for Ohio customers with reduced pricing volatility and economic development benefits for the state, AEP Ohio has been actively engaged with a variety of stakeholders to introduce legislation that will enable this to occur. The two primary components of our proposed Ohio restructuring legislation include not only the recovery of OVEC per a legislative solution and also clarity on regulated recovery for the building of new generation if the PUCO determines a need. With respect to OVEC, House Bill 239 with a Companion Bill in the Senate calls for the owners of OVEC to receive recovery of OVEC through billing of customers or customer credits when market prices are above cost.","The legislation would take the PUCO's actions of approving recovery for AEP, which needs to be reapproved every few years via the ESP, and make it last for the remainder of the life of the plant, so that's through 2030. The bill would provide benefits to all OVEC utility co-owners in the state. So it's obviously something that's supported by the other utilities, and we expect hearings to resume when the legislature returns from summer recess in September followed with a vote in the House and the Senate. The OVEC bill seems to have wide range of support at this point.","Once we have an outcome of the OVEC legislation, we expect the legislature to consider a bill to provide clarity on regulated recovery for the building of new generation. This restructuring legislation certainly will have more hurdles to overcome with opposing parties, but AEP believes there are several compelling reasons why this should be considered that would benefit the State of Ohio and our customers.","So now, moving over to the equalizer graph, you can see that we have regulated operating ROEs currently averaging about 9.8%, which we typically range \u2013 you'll see it quarter-to-quarter in the 9.8% to 10.2% range; so, centered around that 10%, in general, we continue to maintain that.","As you can see, there's \u2013 we've noted that with asterisks, the ones that are in rate cases, and they typically are the ones that are lower from an ROE perspective. So we're doing exactly what was expected of us in terms of ensuring that we are getting the kind of return expectations for the investments that are made in these various jurisdictions.","We also are showing AEP Ohio a little bit differently because we wanted to make it absolutely clear that the 13.6% return that's reflected here is all-in that includes legacy items that were involved in the settlement, involved in other activities, like the RSR payments and those kinds of things, that are not included in a SEET analysis. So if you exclude those items, the actual return on equity for AEP Ohio is 12.2% on a SEET basis. So just want to make absolutely clear that, when we look at AEP Ohio, we're looking at two different things there. But the SEET-related activities, which is really germane to what AEP is actually accomplishing, is the 12.2%. The rest is legacy-related items.","So looking at each jurisdiction, and as I mentioned, AEP Ohio is obviously moving ahead with filings that have been made relative to grid modernization and other activities with smart cities, which is incredibly important to AEP from a strategic perspective to ensure that we're moving ahead from a technological perspective.","APCo \u2013 the ROE at APCo at the end of the second quarter was 8.9%. There's been a onetime recognition last year as a result of the 2015 West Virginia base case, so that's why you see the ROE dropping off. But we'll \u2013 and also, the weather has been a significant impact from a ROE perspective for the quarter as well to APCo. Base rates, as you know, are still frozen in Virginia as a result of the February 15 rate freeze law.","And as far as Kentucky is concerned, I talked about the Kentucky case. We obviously have filed. That's an important case in front of the Commission. I know it's a challenging case, given the loss of load there, and that's an issue for us. And I think there's a two-pronged approach there; one in relation to the rate-making aspects. The other is related to the economic development in the territory, and I can't say enough about the work that Matt Satterwhite's doing out there in terms of the president out in Kentucky.","We have recently had announcement of the large aluminum company that's agreed to locate in the service territory bringing 500 permanent jobs and 1,000 construction jobs. And it really is centered on the aerospace technology area, so hopefully that'll be a seed type of opportunity for other businesses to locate there.","So we're working very heavily on a two-pronged approach there; obviously, have to meet the rate-making aspects of it, but secondly, we are working really hard on the economic development side of things to improve the denominator associated with the rate-making activity.","From an I&M perspective, we achieved an ROE of 9.3%, mainly impacted by weather and formula rate true-ups. I&M filed, as you know, the rate cases in both Michigan and Indiana.","PSO at the end of the quarter was 6.7%. The low \u2013 that low ROE is primarily because of the regulatory lag in the outcome of the last Oklahoma Commission rate case there. And this rate case that's been filed, now, is particularly important because \u2013 particularly in light of the investment \u2013 the proposed investment related to the wind project. We have to see a positive indication in relation to the ability to invest in Oklahoma. And this current case is extremely important in demonstrating our ability to invest in that state. So we're looking for a good outcome out of this particular rate case.","SWEPCO \u2013 the ROE for SWEPCO at the end of 2017 was 6.3%, and certainly SWEPCO is working on full cost recovery associated with the environmental equipment that I mentioned earlier. And of course, in April, the LPSC \u2013 the Louisiana Public Service Commission unanimously approved an increase to the formula-based rates, increasing annual revenues by $36 million, which those rates were effective May 1st. So SWEPCO continues to make progress from that perspective, but you still have the \u2013 and will continue for the time being, having the overhang of the Turk plant, the 88 megawatts of Turk that still is hanging out there. So we'll continue to see that. And it definitely impacts the ROE by \u2013 overall ROE by about 1.3%.","AEP Texas \u2013 the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the second quarter 2017 was 10.2%, and the lower ROE is primarily due to increased capital expenditures and slightly lower than expected revenues.","As far as the Transco is concerned, it continues to plug along; second quarter at 13.2%. The improved ROE is driven by decrease in regulatory lag compared to prior years, primarily due to the implementation of fully forward-looking rates in the PJM region as a result of the 205 case.","So we continue to make progress. It shows the diversity of the AEP system. Some are going to be high; some are going to be low. Actually, none are high, if I \u2013 make sure \u2013 make that point. But certainly, for those that are lower from an ROE perspective, we continue to work on those and we're making the steps that you would expect us to make.","So with that, I'll conclude. As you can see, we're in the midst of some substantial rate activity in our state jurisdictions this year and continue our strong growth in the transmission business. But we also continue to make considerable progress on our mission to be the premier regulated energy company of the future.","With a culture that supports innovation, financial and operational discipline and execution, and our focus on the future, Wind Catcher, Smart Cities Columbus, BOLD Transmission being perfect examples, this company is heading in a different, but right, direction.","As many of you know, I play the drums in a band that is appropriately named The Power Chords. One of our favorite songs we haven't played, yet, is Hitch a Ride by Boston. The lyrics talk about leaving the steely cold city and hitching a ride to the other side, of sailing away, sunshine and freedom. Interesting; wind, sun and freedom to make the right decisions with a firm foundation. That's why AEP is different today, and we remain undaunted in our mission. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity.","Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.75 per share, or $370 million, compared to $0.95 per share, or $466 million in 2016. This difference can primarily be attributed to the sale of the competitive generating assets and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year.","Let's look at our earning drivers by segment. Earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.25 per share, down $0.18. Favorable prior-year items contribute to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, a June 2016 recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia and a 2016 positive tax adjustment. Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investments across multiple jurisdictions. Weather was milder than last year, as Nick said, and our normalized retail margins were slightly lower. Other unfavorable items in this segment include higher O&M due to transmission services and forestry expenses, higher depreciation and lower AFUDC.","The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 from last year. Unfavorable drivers in this segment include the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, lower normalized retail margins, higher O&M due to increased transmission services, higher depreciation and a higher effective income tax rate due to positive 2016 adjustments. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items are recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers and higher ERCOT transmission revenue.","Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.26 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.07 over last year. The growth in earnings includes the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates. This segment also recorded formula rate true-ups for the second quarter, which are similar to last year's number. In future years, the true-up should remain minimal due to the implementation of forecasted rates. We experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement earlier this year. The growth in earnings over last year also reflects our return on incremental investment. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by $1.1 billion, an increase of 32% since last year.","The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.04 per share, down $0.05 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of the competitive generating assets. Partially offsetting this negative impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, better wind conditions and lower overall costs.","Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year due to increased O&M and interest expense.","Let's turn to slide 7 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $1.72 per share, or $845 million, compared to $1.97 per share, or $967 million dollars in 2016. This difference can primarily be attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of competitive generating assets and positive items that occurred last year. Offsetting these effects were transmission earnings and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers.","Let's look at these earnings drivers by segment. Earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.69 per share, down $0.30 with the single largest driver being weather, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.11. Partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers is the increased recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions. The box on the chart lists other smaller impacts for the segment.","Through June, the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.47 per share, the same as in 2016. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue and weather. These were partially offset by several items, including lower normalized load, the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, and higher O&M, depreciation and effective income tax rates.","AEP Transmission Holdco segment earnings through June were $0.41 per share, up $0.13 over last year. The growth in earnings includes the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates, the impact of the annual true-up for formula rates, and a return on incremental investment.","The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.18 per share, down $0.06 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings from the sale of the competitive generation assets as well as lower trading and marketing margins. These decreases were offset by lower depreciation on the remaining generating assets and improvement in the retail business, positive impacts from solar projects going into service and lower overall costs.","Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year due to increased O&M. For the year-to-date period, certain unfavorable comparisons to 2016 were anticipated, like the sale of the competitive generating assets. The milder weather was not anticipated, but is a reality that we are addressing. In response to these issues, we will manage to lower O&M expenses for the second half of 2017 compared to 2016. With that in mind, we are confident in reaffirming our operating earnings guidance for the year.","Now, let's take a look at slide 8 to review normalized load performance. Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 0.7% this quarter and are now essentially flat for the year. For both the quarter and the year-to-date, the growth in industrial sector is being offset by declining residential and commercial sales.","Moving clockwise on the slide, industrial sales increased by 4% this quarter, bringing year-to-date growth in line with expectations for the year at 1.8%. Industrial sales trends have improved since the second quarter of last year when the impact of low energy prices was the most severe. We are now seeing strong industrial results across most of our operating companies and industry. We are optimistic that growth in industrial sales is predictive of better performance for our residential and commercial classes.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were down 1.5% for the quarter and down 1.6% year-to-date. Residential customer counts were up 0.4% this quarter, which is nearly double the pace we saw in 2016. Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 0.7%, bringing the year-to-date normalized growth to negative 0.4%.","Commercial sales were down across our system with the most pronounced drop in Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. Since residential and commercial sales tend to lag industrial growth in a business cycle, we anticipate improvement in these classes in the coming quarters.","Turning to slide 9, let's take a deeper look at some of the indicators that help explain our stronger industrial load performance for the quarter. The top chart shows the relationship between AEP's oil and gas extraction sales and oil prices. In 2017, oil prices have hovered around the $50 per barrel range during the first two quarters, which has been enough to attract more upstream drilling activity within our service territory. Compared to last year, oil and gas extraction sales are up 3.2% for the quarter, which is the strongest growth since 2015. The increase in drilling activity is largely focused in Oklahoma.","The bottom chart is showing the relationship between our mining load and the price of natural gas. Mining production is closely tied to demand from the electric utility sector. When natural gas prices are low, electricity markets tend to select more gas generation over coal units. In addition, we have experienced increased mining for metallurgical coals in the Appalachian Basin.","Higher commodity prices in 2017 are responsible for the improvement in this sector's sales for the quarter, which are positive for the first time in years. We will continue to monitor energy prices throughout the year as it clearly impacts our energy related industries.","Now, let's review the status of our regional economies on slide 10. As you know from previous calls, most of the energy producing economies within our service territory experienced recession in 2016, especially in the West. With higher energy prices and the subsequent pick-up in oil and gas activity in 2017, our service territory has now come out of recession and is in recovery.","As shown in the upper left chart, our Eastern Territory grew by 3.2% this quarter, which was 0.7% faster than the U.S. estimate. Our Western Territory grew by 0.5%, which is a notable improvement from previous quarters.","Looking at the growth at our East Vertically Integrated Utilities in the upper right chart, it is noteworthy that Kentucky Power eclipsed Indiana\/Michigan in terms of GDP growth. As you know, Kentucky Power's territory has a higher concentration of coal mining, which improved for the first time in years. Indiana\/Michigan, on the other hand, has a higher exposure to the automotive industry, which had a record-setting year in 2016, but has moderated since. Appalachian Power's territory came out of recession last quarter and is expected to improve throughout the year.","The bottom-left chart shows our West Vertically Integrated Utilities. SWEPCO's service territory came out of recession last quarter and saw 1.1% growth in GDP compared to last year. PSO, on the other hand, is still technically in recession and isn't expected to emerge until later this year.","Finally, in the bottom-right chart, you see that both of our Transmission and Distribution Utilities continue to improve in the second quarter with the growth in Ohio nearly 3% above that in Texas. Ohio service territory is more diversified with growth coming from many sectors, such as manufacturing, construction and education and health services.","Overall, we are encouraged by the economic trends of our operating companies. They are consistent with the improvement we projected in our guidance for 2017.","Now, let's move to slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased 0.5% during the quarter to 54.5%. Our FFO to debt ratio is solidly in the BBB+ and Baa1 range at 18.1%.","In June, Moody's upgraded Ohio Power's rating two notches from Baa1 to A2 and cited the strong financial metrics and a supportive regulatory environment as reasons for the upgrade. In addition, Moody's revised the outlook for AEP from stable to positive, recognizing strong financial performance of Ohio Power, I&M and the Transcos, as well as AEP's overall strategy of focusing on growth in our wires business.","Our qualified pension funding improved approximately one percentage point to 99%. Plan assets increased due to strong returns and a company contribution of $94 million dollars during the quarter. Plan liabilities were essentially flat due to relatively stable interest rates.","Our OPEB funding improved two percentage points during the quarter to 110% with investment gains outpacing plan benefit payments and expenses. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans for 2017 is expected to be unchanged from last year at about $15 million.","Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $1.85 billion supported by our $3 billion revolving credit facility. As discussed last quarter, we terminated the $500 million facility in May.","Let's turn to slide 12 and try and wrap this up. While quarterly and year-to-date earnings were below last year's results, with the exception of weather, these results were anticipated due to the sale of our competitive generating assets and certain 2016 events that did not repeat this year. Our financial results are in line with the internal forecasts that support our annual guidance.","We expect O&M expense for the second half of 2017 to be favorable compared to 2016 by $0.16 per share. We expect these reductions to be evenly spread amongst the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments.","Accordingly, we're reaffirming our 2017 operating earnings guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share and expect to deliver results, as Nick said earlier, in the middle of that guidance range.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, everyone. It's actually Kevin (33:42) here.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey, Kevin.","Unknown Speaker","If I'm just looking at your capital floor cash through 2019, it's about $5.6 billion a year and a 7.7% CAGR. Based on the current line of sight if you don't consider the wind project, would you expect a material drop off in core capital needs after 2019?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. So then, the $4.5 billion, I think, is 35% wires and 65% for the wind assets?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's right.","Unknown Speaker","The wind assets should be turnkey, so it wouldn't really impact EPS until probably 2021. What about the 35%? Would we see traditional rate making, like AFUDC, in 2020 or 2019?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, that's right. That's right. It'd be traditional rate making on that.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's all I have. Thanks guys.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just picking it up, also on the wind, the new investment, any thoughts, preliminary, Nick, on how you might finance this and how much room you have to put (35:02) leverage in the mix?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, obviously, we want to get to a point of getting Commission approvals, because I think this is a huge project. It's a great project. If you look at it company-by-company, it's not that huge. But when you look at the companies involved, the areas involved, we need to go through with the regulators and make sure they understand and see the benefits; and, some already have, but the benefits that we see in this project. Once we get to that point, then we'll be in a much better position to talk about financing and capital required and whether we issue equity.","We've talked in the past about it. When you have a large project that really made sense and that we could focus the investment on that as opposed to the general confers of the corporation, then we believe investors should like that. So if we go down the road, we'll figure out what the appropriate mix is. And obviously, you know, we continue to look at capital, look at our credit metrics. I want to make sure we \u2013 that we remain a very firm foundation for investment. So Brian, I don't know if you have anything add to it.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","I don't. We've always been thoughtful about how we finance our capital projects. As this progresses and we hear from the regulators, their interest in it, we'll look to put together a firm plan to make sure that we do it is as wisely as possible, as we do our regular capital program.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","There are just not many projects you'll run into \u2013 and you know, really, the sense of urgency around getting approvals for this thing is centered on the federal government's basically given a 62%, 63% off sale and \u2013 with the PTCs; and, to take full advantage of the PTCs, that's $2.5 billion alone.","So obviously, we want to get this thing through. And when you get \u2013 take all that into account just to apply investment and that kind of capital and reduce customer bills as a result and produce actually a more \u2013 certainly, a more resilient system as a result, I think is a great thing. So \u2013 but we'll have to figure it out when we get there.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Nick, can you give any insight into the calculation of the $7 billion customer benefit, like do you \u2013 are you assuming a carbon price? With what sort of level, and just is there anything else to kind of help us kind of get to that number?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So you know, we've obviously assumed a natural gas price going forward, because, obviously, this is a important hedge against fuel cost. And when you look at \u2013 we did (37:59-38:10) differentials. Obviously, we looked at carbon, and we looked at the value of the production tax credit. So those three components certainly provided the center of the analysis.","And we've looked at mid-range cases. We've looked at low cases in terms of natural gas pricing and that kind of thing, and it still stands up. I mean, when you look at the \u2013 certainly, the immediate benefits and the real benefits of the PTCs along with what could happen with carbon, what could happen with natural gas prices, it just looks like a great project. So...","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The $7 billion number, the $2.7 billion NPV, is that kind of the mid scenario, or where does that fit within the range of scenarios you looked at?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes, that's the mid case scenario, which was still a reasonably low natural gas price comparison.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, could I just \u2013 finally, on the transmission piece, obviously, you said normal rate making, but what's the \u2013 would that also be predominantly spending that would fall kind of in the back half of \u2013 very end of your plan into the sort of beyond 2019 period?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Absolutely.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So we should think about this as more how we sustain 5% to 7% rather than incremental to or...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's a good question. You know, obviously, our indigenous utility growth is centered on 5% to 7%. I think it should make the 5% to 7% more robust.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hi, Chris. How are you doing?","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to follow up yet again on the wind project, I don't think you talked about recovery for the actual generation portion of it. If you take ownership at a specific kind of date when it becomes commercial, I guess you could time it with a general rate case, certainly, but would you also pursue a rider on top of that just to have a measure of a safe cushion there?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, we will. And then, you know, it's part of the normal rate making process, but we would obviously be filing for whatever CCN approvals and we got \u2013 there's an exception to the MBM rule, the Market Based Mechanism, in Louisiana that, I guess, a hearing just yesterday or the day before approved an exception for that. So you're going through the right steps to get to the point where the Commissions become comfortable with the investment, and then we'll go through the normal rate making process for both the generation and the transmission.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I think one of your peers had gotten some support from committing to local procurement of equipment with a project in Colorado. Are there any other kind of offerings that you're making to politicians and the Commissions down the road that would help kind of garner support here?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes, certainly. I mean, obviously, you don't do a project like this without looking at the socio-economic benefits in the region and for the customers. So \u2013 and even Governor Hutchison this morning mentioned it's good for jobs in Arkansas as well, but substantial \u2013 certainly, there's substantial procurement in all four of the states involved.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, switching gears to rate making, the PSO filing that you just made had a pretty big ask and you just got a conclusion of a rate case with new rates effective early this year in that jurisdiction. I (42:22) 9.5% authorized ROE. Could you just remind us of some of the challenges that you faced in getting that rate case across the finish line, if any?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So with the previous rate case in Oklahoma, obviously, we were disappointed with that outcome; and, it was a somewhat challenging time in many respects. And when you \u2013 when we look at the present case, our message has clearly been that this is a very important rate case for Oklahoma, because Oklahoma was doing just fine from a jurisdictional perspective up until a couple of years ago, and then the last rate case was really deficient in terms of its outcome because not only was the timeframe long to get it resolved, but also the outcome is, in effect, chasing expenses that are being made on behalf of customers.","So we've got to get that back on the right track, and that's why this case is so important. Not only will it send a signal that we can invest the way we feel like we should in Oklahoma, and can in Oklahoma, but also have an impact on projects like we just discussed, because you really have to think about investments in jurisdictions that are chronically short.","Oklahoma has not been that, and I think we're viewing sort of a perturbation that we can recover from. And I truly believe that Oklahoma and Stuart Solomon down at PSO, which is our President down at PSO, is working very hard to get that message across to everyone involved that in order to have a successful Oklahoma from an energy standpoint, PSO has to be part of that picture. And certainly, we're focused on making sure we get a good outcome.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Can you just remind us of the test year in that case and any kind of true-ups throughout the process?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. Do you have the test year...? Let's see.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Chris, we can have Bette Jo get you that detail","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey, Anthony.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just to stay on the wind and follow up on Jonathan's question, so this is wind that would be in rate base and this is wind that you had said is kind of, you used the word, more robust incremental to 5% to 7% utility growth?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Certainly, we still maintain our 5% to 7% earnings growth trajectory and, really, we'll have to see how this project gets resolved in combination with all the other projects that we're doing to see what it does to be ultimate growth rate going forward. So in and of itself, the project is incremental, but obviously, we need to \u2013 before we start talking about changes in growth rates, we need to make absolutely sure what project we have, and also how it plays in concert with all the other capital programs we have in place.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Would more generation in a region put even more stress on the unregulated portion of the Turk plant?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So you have the 88 megawatts of Turk sitting out there, but when we did the analysis, you know, we showed that even though you're taking some 9 million megawatt hours of wind power and energy coming in, you still need the capacity across the board. And in fact, when we looked at the capacity factors of the other generation, you only saw a very small 1% to 3% drop off in terms of capacity factor on coal. And certainly, even with natural gas, it wasn't that large of a drop off.","So this is really playing against, you know, the forward view of fitting in a slice of energy to the benefit of consumers, but still using the capacity out there that's available. So it could put more pressure on the unregulated part of Turk, but Turk is a very efficient unit not \u2013 I don't think it's going to be \u2013 I mean, any difference is probably going to be negligible at best.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just switching gears, Ohio, you had said that I \u2013 I don't know if it's \u2013 you used the word settlement discussions are going on or potential for settlement with the extension of the ESP. Do you think there's issues with \u2013 you have \u2013 in the legislature, you have, is it HB 247, I think to end ESPs or to change the way utilities file rate case in Ohio? At the same time, at the PUC you're trying to extend the settlement of an ESP. You think that may cause any \u2013 may prohibit you from reaching a settlement there?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No, I don't think that legislation is going to go very far.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey, Leslie.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Hi, how are you?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Fine.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Just for a little clarification, I'm sorry if it's sort of already been covered, but you would file for approval shortly for the wind projects? And then, you would plan to commence construction, if approved, in 2018 at some point?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's right.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Mid 2018?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, and we'd be looking for an outcome on those regulatory cases by April of next year. So we don't have much time to waste on that one. It really is \u2013 it's really driven by making sure we can take full advantage of the PTCs. That's the driver. And for the Commissions that take a look at this, you know, it is a fairly unique situation in that, yes, it's great generation resources. Yes, it provides considerable benefits to customers, but the timing of it needs to match up so that we can be successful in terms of putting it in place and taking advantage of those PTCs.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","So you've already safe-harbored the equipment, or I guess the developer has done that?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. Yes, we have.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","And I guess, why does the region need 2,000 megawatts of generation? I mean, are you shutting other plants? Are you \u2013 you know, is demand growing? You said capacity factors on (49:48) gas plants won't decline that much.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, Leslie, and really \u2013 and this is probably the most important point to be made in the regulatory filings, and I'm glad you asked that question. This is really \u2013 any wind power project is an energy play, not a capacity play. So from an energy perspective, you're going to get 9 million megawatt hours out of it coming into the system, but at the same time you're only going to get, I think, an SBP that's only like 7%. I may be off by a percent or two, but only 7% counts as capacity.","So you still need the other units to provide capacity, and they fill in from an energy perspective as well. So we just have to keep in mind, this project, the difference in capacity and energy. We're not shutting any other units down. Those units are absolutely needed.","But what it does do is provide more diversity from a resource perspective, low energy \u2013 very low energy pricing coming in to the sector, which means economic growth. And then, when you think about the transmission side of things, yes, it's a 765, 360-some-odd mile generation interconnect, but usually with large transmission you get large economic development. So I see this as just an extremely important project not just from a energy consumption standpoint, but from an economic development standpoint as well.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","So the benefits to customers are from lower fuel costs?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Absolutely. You know, you're basically \u2013 it's a hedge and it's an arbitrage against, primarily, fossil fuel generation resources. And so, if you're able to take the energy and continue with the capacity as used and useful, it's another powerful combination just like we used to do coal pricing versus natural gas pricing. Now you have coal pricing, natural gas pricing and, certainly, the intermittent resources provided from a wind power perspective. So just adds another part of the portfolio.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","So do you anticipate that when you make these filings that it would result in rate increases to customers?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No. No, it won't. Actually, that's the amazing part of it. You're investing a large part of the capital, but keep in mind the government's paying you \u2013 the federal government's paying you for a substantial part of this capital. And then, it's being used \u2013 from an energy perspective, you look at the overall cost to consumers, the cost of the capital being deployed through rate base, and then the attendant energy reductions through fuel, it's a benefit to customers. And that's where we come up with the $7 billion over the 25-year period. I mean, it's substantial.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Nick. So just on that same topic, is it \u2013 will it be clear in there, kind of in like the first year or two, that there's net reductions like in year one to customers from this, so that....?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Oh, yeah. It's not like it's back-end loaded or anything. These \u2013 in year one, you're seeing benefits to consumers.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, I guess more importantly, just for the approval process in the different states, can you just talk to a little bit of \u2013 I know states have different rules and laws on how they approve projects like this. Xcel, I know, has kind of gone through different processes...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","...doing something similar. So could you just \u2013 like, is it \u2013 did any \u2013 can all these approvals be done through just the regulatory process? Do any states need legislative changes or some kind of different way of doing regulation?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No. Steve, there's no legislative changes. It's all done through the regulatory process. But just keep in mind, and this goes back to the investment \u2013 you know, whether it's in our capital plan or not. States deal with it in different fashions. I mean \u2013 and if we're talking April, we're going to have to sit down at the end of that April time period and figure out, okay, what are the risks to our shareholders of moving forward with this particular project given the \u2013 not only the regulatory outcomes, but also the other risk components that are involved with this as well. And we believe, certainly from a risk standpoint, from an operational and construction standpoint, if we can't put generators on top of poles and build transmission lines that we always build all the time, you know, we shouldn't be in this business. So it's not like building a central station generation facility.","So you don't have the same level of risk from that perspective, but the risk part of it \u2013 part of the evaluation will be as well \u2013 be what kind of indications we're getting from the various jurisdictions because, some of them, you may get outright approval, some of you may get CCN approvals or CECPN approvals in Arkansas. And what is that going to mean? What is it going to mean in terms of risk?","So we have another milestone. We continue to spend money on development of this project, because we feel like it's that important. But in the April timeframe, we will be sitting down with our board to talk about, okay, what have we learned? What are the options available to us and what are the risks being taken, and make a decision to continue on.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just on going back to the Ohio ESP talk, you said you're having discussions and \u2013 I can't remember your comment, but I think it sounded optimistic. So can you just give a little more color on how you feel on the ESP extension?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So you know these discussions have been going on for quite a while with multiple parties, and some of the issues are new and challenging issues. You know, when you think about Smart Cities and the technology deployment and everybody thinks they ought to have part of the game, and we think, you know, universal access was important and we should be the primary driver of ensuring that that access is providing to all consumers, including underdeveloped, but also others as well so. So it's challenging issues, and things you have to go back and forth with the different parties on. And we've been \u2013 I can say we've been fairly successful in conversations with several of the parties. And there's still a few issues that are still outstanding, but we feel like progress is being made.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Nicholas K.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to now turn the conference over to our host Managing Director of Investor Relations, Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Salina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas Akins","Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for AEP's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As we move into the New Year and look back at 2018, we are pleased to report solid earnings for the quarter and for the year.","Favorable weather continued into the fourth quarter, with the economy remaining healthy albeit tempered later in the year by the negative impacts of trade tariffs issues and the strong dollar.","With that said, 2018 was the strongest normalized load growth since 2011. We continue to see customer counts pick up and load growth continue, and primarily the oil and gas sectors and residential sales growth as well. Overall good, but we'll keep a close watch on the sector growth in the economy and the customer load growth makeup.","As you all no, we earlier, during third quarter 2018, revised our guidance for operating earnings from $3.75 to $3.95 per share to $3.88 to $3.98 per share and came in for the year solidly in the upper end of the revised guidance at $3.95 per share.","We're very pleased with how our employees continue to work to provide a better customer experience while being dependably consistent to our shareholders on delivering these results.","2018 was clearly has been a great year, but I am even more pleased with the track record over the last 8 years of what we have achieved. Brian and I and the rest of the team take this very personally and see this as one of the hallmarks of the emerging brand of AEP.","So let's take a look at the actual numbers for 2018, starting with the financial performance for the fourth quarter. We came in with GAAP earnings of $0.74 per share versus $0.81 per share in 2017 and operating earnings of $0.72 per share versus $0.85 per share in 2017.","This brought the year-to-date 2018 total GAAP earnings to $3.90 per share versus $3.89 per share in 2017 and year-to-date 2018 total operating earnings to $3.95 per share versus $3.68 per share in 2017. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings primarily being generation plant-related impairments and tax adjustments.","We also concluded rate cases in five states as a pretty heavy year from that perspective, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas. AEP also filed rate cases in two states, West Virginia and Oklahoma, which will conclude earlier this year.","Tax reform-related activities were also major regulatory undertakings in the AEP state jurisdiction as well. All are proceeding well in order to generally ranging from primarily excess unprotected ADIT refunds being amortized over various periods or applied against depreciation or various riders [ph]. Almost all of the states have concluded orders reflecting these adjustments, and we did not expect any additional impacts during 2019.","Moreover, even with the headwinds described earlier in an increasing interest rate environment, AEP continues to outperform the S&P 500 Electric Utilities Index and the S&P 500 over the 1 year, 3 year and 5 year periods. Again, as I said last year at this time, the very definition of a premium regulated utility.","So great performance in the past, but the recognition of one of this year's Rock Hall of Fame inductees Janet Jackson and the title of one of hers songs What Have You Done for Me Lately, let's talk about what we see in 2019.","AEP's operating earnings per share guidance range for 2019 is $4 to $4.20 per share. As we had said during EEI financial last November and continue to say with the capital plan, we've outlined for the next 5 years, including $6.5 billion in 2019, our focus on disciplined capital allocation among our businesses and additional opportunities to grow renewables beyond our financial plan, we have been very disappointed to not ultimately be in the upper range of our 5% to 7% growth rate.","Additionally, I will reiterate the regulated renewables opportunities represented by the various integrated resource plans filed in our state jurisdictions are not included in our capital forecast of upside potential certainly exist.","We also continue to work to bend the O&M curve through efficiencies, process automation and digitization as well as implement technologies to drive efficiencies while improving the customer experience.","Regarding the renewables opportunities, we have filed integrated resource plans and RFPs with all of the SWEPCO and PSO state jurisdictions representing up to 2,200 megawatts of wind resources. On March 1, Vizard's [ph] new focused on ownership of these facilities primarily due to factors such as balance sheet optimization, scalability opportunities, deliverability and various other risks versus of the use of PPAs. We will file the results of the RFP process in August, and each state regulatory circumstance will determine the path forward.","Our view is that all construction will be completed by the end of 2021, thereby taking advantage of the 80% PTC value and contribute to earnings starting in 2022.","The Ohio 400-megawatt solar review process continues, which is part of the 900 megawatts renewables contemplated for AEP Ohio. Hearings are continuing this week and the next week regarding the question of need for these facilities really focused on a strict definition based on capacity or other broader stated issues regarding renewables, job creation, state economic development which governor DeWine is very interested in and others.","It is interesting to note low-income customer support us in this case because of the accessibility of renewable resources that would not otherwise be available. This position goes directly to the message that utilities are inherently equipped to derive the scale to reduce costs and the ability to provide universal access to these types of resources and technologies. After the hearings, we will continue to push this process forward to resolve this important question for Ohio.","As far as rate cases are concerned, we contemplate - we completed a heavy load of rate cases in 2018 as, I mentioned earlier, in the 5 states, and we await the finalization of the already filed West Virginia and Oklahoma rate cases soon this year. We will also be filing rate cases in Arkansas and Texas as soon as well.","Regarding the West Virginia rate case, we have already filed a settlement agreement among the major parties including the staff that is effective in March, so we should be in order soon from the commission.","Regarding Oklahoma, as you all know, this is our third try to receive a positive outcome in Oklahoma where we have been locally underachieving from a financial viewpoint while providing excellent customer satisfaction operational performance.","Interveners and staff testimony has been filed, and we believe our tenor of where we stand at this point is even keeled with some bright spots of at least recognizing law perhaps has concerned with the concept of performance-based ratemaking for various reasons, there may be options for distribution riders or forward test years that could alleviate the pressure of regulatory lag.","The ROEs filed by the parties were slightly higher than the proposals from last case we went through but are still among the lowest in the nation. As Oklahoma really open for business and economic development has renewed Oklahoma government expresses, we'll find out.","We're always open to settlement discussions with the parties to resolve these different issues, and we have a long way to go. And in no doubt we'll come down to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission making the ultimate call. I would ask them as our referee to make the right call and not be like the NEC championship game.","This is important from the perspective of the integrity of the regulatory process in Oklahoma, the help of PSO and its stability to invest in the state and from an economic development standpoint that concerns the significant AEP presence, not PSO, but AEP of over 600 employees centralized in Tulsa. We expect interim rates in Oklahoma to be in place in April and an order from the commission soon thereafter.","So now I'll turn it over to the equalizer chart and talk about some of the state actions here. Overall, the regulated operations ROE is currently 9.7% versus 10.1% last quarter. I'll remind you that we generally project the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be in the 9.5% to 10% range.","The primary reason for the slight decline from quarter four versus quarter three was the increase in O&M in fourth quarter this year versus the lower spend as we had very tempered weather last year and in the fourth quarter. So some adjustments were made there.","As far as AEP Ohio is concerned, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 was 14.5%. The primary driver is obviously continue to be some of the adjustments that were made previously, the RSR, the fuel, the PIR, those kinds of adjustments that are going to roll off by the end of - some will roll off by the end of last year and some will roll off toward the middle part this year. We expect to see the ROEs come closer to the authorized range as we go forward.","APCo. The ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 was 9.4% compared to 9.9% at the end of third quarter. APCo's changing ROE from third quarter is primarily attributable to higher storm restoration expense during the fourth quarter and a tax true-up. And again, I will remind you there's a settlement agreement that will become effective in March 2019.","In Virginia, APCo's first triangle review is in 2020 and will cover the 2017 and 2019 periods. For the first triangle case for rate adjustment clauses in the period December 2018 to November 2020, the Virginia corporation issuing authorized the 9.42% ROE, which will be the reference going into the period to determine whether APCo's Virginia earnings for the 3-year period or within the allowed range. The proved ROE for West Virginia is 9.75% right now.","In Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky at the end of the fourth quarter was 9% compared to 9.2% at the end of third quarter. Kentucky Power continued to perform well in 2018 from a 5.1% ROE at the end of 2017 to the 9.0% ROE at the end of 2018. So great progress in Kentucky.","I&M. The ROE in I&M at the end of the fourth quarter was 11.4% versus 12% in the third quarter. I&M posted strong results in 2018 primarily driven by favorable weather. This was O&M spending and onetime true-ups associated with the regulatory items.","Favorable rate reviews in both Indiana and Michigan also contributed to the strong year. And then as far as PSO is concerned, the ROE we've talked about previously is 6.9% versus 7.7% at the end of third quarter.","PSO's ROE continues to improve over last year, which was 5.92%, but was slightly down in the fourth quarter mainly due to unfavorable normalized retail margins. However, the ROE continues to be challenged, primarily because of ongoing regulatory lag, and as you know, we have a rate case filed there to resolve some of those issues.","SWEPCO, their ROE at the end of fourth quarter was 6.5% versus 7.4% at the end of third quarter. Primary reason for the decrease in the ROE is the impact of the most recent Texas rate case. The company recorded $31 million in December 2017 that related back to an implementation date of May 2017.","SWEPCO's ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the FERC [ph] plant. It's not in retail rates. This impacts ROE by about 135 basis points. SWEPCO also had contracts expire with certain wholesale customers during the period as well, so that has an effect. We plan to file an Arkansas base rate case this year, so we'll continue with that to try to address the SWEPCO's issues.","AEP Texas at the end of the fourth quarter was 8.5% versus 8.8% at the end of the third quarter. While earnings have grown year-over-year, the reason for the declining ROE is due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings as we continue to make significant capital investments along with some timing-related O&M spend.","Favorable regulatory treatment has allowed us to file annual DCRF and Biennial T [ph] cost annual filings, but the fast growth in rate base and associated property taxes and depreciation has made lag and more significant factor, so we continue to invest heavily down there.","AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for Transmission at the end of fourth quarter was 10% versus 10.4% in third quarter, and it's primarily lower in the third quarter due to differences between actual taxes and equity balances versus projected taxes and equity balances filed in our former rate revenue applications. This difference will be recognized in our June 2019 formulate rate true-up.","So all in all, still within the range we have talked about previously, the 9.5% to 10% we expect to continue in that range, and we also expect continual improvement in the ones that are hanging a little bit lower.","So as we move forward into 2019, we intend on building upon a tremendous track record of delivering earnings well within our guidance range, and in fact, in the last 6 years have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range each and every year.","Borrowing the words from another of this year's Rock Hall of Fame inductees, Dep Leopard, from the song Hysteria, our consistency and quality of delivering positive financial and operational results is such a magical hysteria. When you get that feeling, better start believing, but AEP is, in fact, the premium regulated utility.","I have two scores to settle real quickly, Nods I hope you're having a great day. And And Scott, I need more cowbell. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the fourth quarter and year-to-date financial results, focusing primarily on year-to-date, provide some insight on loading the economy, review our balance sheet, liquidity and pensions and finish with a review of our outlook for 2019.","Let's begin on Slide 7, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.72 per share or $354 million compared to $0.85 per share or $420 million in 2017. Most of this year-over-year borrowings was expected and came from higher O&M as we reduced spending in 2017 in response to that year's unfavorable weather.","All the detail by segment is shown in the boxes on the chart, but the change in the regulated businesses was driven by higher O&M and decreased load, more than offsetting a return on incremental investment to serve our customers.","The generation of marketing segment produced operating earnings of $0.07 per share, up $0.02 from last year due to higher energy margins and favorable income taxes. Corporate and Other was down $0.10 due to higher O&M interest and income tax expenses.","Turning to Slide 8, we will review the year-to-date comparison in more detail. Our annual operating earnings for 2018 was $3.95 per share or $1.9 billion compared to $3.68 per share or $1.8 billion in 2017. This difference can primarily be attributed to favorable weather and recovery of incremental investment, partially offset by higher O&M as we reduced spending in 2017. Our regulated segments experienced growth for the year. And as expected, our competitive generation of marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales.","Looking at the earning drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2 per share, up $0.36, with the single largest driver being weather, which added $0.33.","Looking at total degree days. 2018 was the highest in the last 30 years while 2017 ranked 29th. Successful implementation of rate changes add another $0.26. Other favorable items included higher transmission revenues in AFUDC as well as lower non-service pension costs and income taxes. Offsetting these items were anticipated decreases in wholesale load and lower normalized retail margins as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses.","The transmission and distribution utilities segment from $1.05 per share, up $0.04 from last year. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes, normalized load and weather as well as lower non-service pension costs. These were partially offset by higher depreciation.","The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.75 per share, up $0.03 over 2017. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base, which was mostly offset by prior period accounting adjustments and minimal formula rate true-ups this year compared to the larger one in 2017. Net plant grew by $1.4 billion or 21% since December of 2017.","The generation of marketing segment produced earnings of $0.29 per share, down $0.01 from last year, due to the sale of assets and mostly offset by favorable income taxes.","Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.15 per share from last year due to the prior year investment gains and higher interest, O&M and income tax expenses.","We are pleased with our results for 2018. As Nick said, we landed in the upper end of updated earnings guidance range.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 for an update on normalized load growth. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales decreased by seven-tenths of a percent for the quarter but ended the year up eight-tenths of a percent compared to 2017. Even with the modest load performance over the last half of 2018, normalized load growth for the year was the strongest AEP has experienced since 2011. Every operating company experienced normalized growth in retail sales in 2018 with the exception of Kentucky Power.","Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and ended the year 2% higher than 2017. The growth in industrial sales moderated in the fourth quarter and was driven by increases in the oil and gas sectors. Industrial sales, excluding oil and gas, experienced a slight contraction in the quarter. This was driven by a more restrictive U.S. trade policy, a weaker global economy, a stronger dollar and lower energy prices.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales increased by two-tenths of a percent for the quarter and ended the year up six-tenths of a percent over 2017. Growth in residential sales was mostly due to customer count growth while normalized usage was down half a percent for the quarter. For the year, residential customer counts increased by six-tenths of a percent, which is twice the growth experienced in 2017.","Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales decreased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter and ended the year down half a percent from 2017. Commercial sales were down across all our operating companies for the quarter and the year. The estimates for load growth presented on this chart differ slightly from what we showed at the EEI conference in fall due to the fact that we now have actual numbers for the full year of 2018 rather than the estimates we have at that time. Our actual load estimate for 2019 has not changed.","Now let's turn to Slide 10 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 2.8% for the quarter, which is three-tenths of a percent below the U.S. The U.S. economy has eclipsed that of AEP service territory since the tariffs went into effect in the second quarter. As discussed on previous calls, AEP has a higher exposure to tariff given its higher concentration to export manufacturing. In fact, 38% of all U.S. exports originate in the 11 states served by regulated utilities.","The upper right chart shows the gap between employment growth is narrowing between AEP service territory and the U.S. The U.S. has experienced stable job growth over the past 2 years, and the job market within AEP's footprint has continued to improve. For the quarter, job growth in AEP's territory was 1.3% with higher growth in the West. The unemployment rate for AEP's territory fell to 4.1% this quarter, which is the lowest level on record. The sectors that added the most job this quarter, the professional and business services, education and health services and leisure and hospitality.","Final chart at the bottom shows the income growth within AEP's footprint has not kept pace with the U.S. in recent months. For the quarter, personal income growth for AEP was two-tenths of a percent below the U.S. Income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales growth.","It is too early to know what the impact of the partial federal government shutdown will have in our economy. Federal government share of unemployment across our territory ranges between seven-tenths of a percent in Arkansas to 7.2% in Texas, with some portion of these numbers being unaffected military employees. The longer the shutdown lasts, the higher impact we would expect to see in residential commercial sales due to lower personal income and spending.","Overall, 2018 was a strong year for the economy in AEP service territory. The boost to incomes from a robust job market and tax reform create a momentum earlier in the year that carried us through the headwinds of the tariffs, stronger dollar and higher interest rates. We expect economic growth to continue in 2019.","Now let's move to Slide 11 and review the company's capitalization, liquidity and pensions. Our debt to total capital ratio increased slightly during the quarter to [57%]. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 17.8% and our net liquidity stood at about $3.1 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding decreased to 99%, and our OPEB funding decreased to 129%. A drop in yields increased the liabilities for both plans while at the same time falling equity prices attractive from asset returns. Our fixed income holdings provided a positive offset to the liability increases in equity losses.","Investors have been asking if our pension expense estimates are increasing in 2019 due to market volatility rate in 2018. We are not seeing a meaningful change in our assumed pension expense. This is largely due to having what we believe are appropriately conservative assumptions regarding discount rate for liabilities and the expected rate of return for investments. We are also comfortable with our asset allocation. As we disclose at EEI, our assumed pension discount rate for 2018 was 3.65%, and for 2019, it's 4.3%. Our assumed asset rate of return has increased slightly by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Our target asset allocation is 25% equities, 60% fixed income and 15% alternatives. Our combined pension, OPEB, pretax expense was a credit of [$65] million in 2018, and we expect a credit of $59 million in 2019.","Now let's wrap this up on Slide 12 and try to get to your questions. We begin 2019 with a solid track record. Our earnings were strong in 2018 as we continue to invest capital in our businesses. For 8 years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending net of assets in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.","In addition, over time, we have grown our dividend with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Last year, AEP's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8.1% on an annual basis. This increase, along with the midpoint of our 2019 earnings guidance range, brings our payout ratio to the middle of our [60%] to 70% targeted range.","Looking ahead to 2019, we are reiterating our operating earnings guidance of $4 to $4.20 per share. We will finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with opportunities in the renewables space. We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital and are confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning.","Nicholas Akins","How are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good, congratulations. So let me go back to where you started the call a little bit. Certainly, we're impressed by the comment on being disappointed, but not being at the high end of that 5% to 7% range. Can you comment a little bit on what gives you that confidence today just given some of the movie [ph] business at the end of the year? But also, I just wanted to understand what your expectations are for moderating ROE in Ohio.","I know we've been talking about it for a little bit. But basically, are you still talking about being at the higher end potentially despite having that moderation? And where the other pluses this year as you think about it?","Nicholas Akins","Yes. So yes, we do expect the high end of that moderation. And also, as I look at the year going into it, certainly with the capital plan that we put out there, the consistency associated with that as well, the opportunities that exist in front of us, we continue to look at those opportunities.","Certainly, the integrated resource plans are applied with the various states, what we're doing not only from that from a video [ph] and incur perspective. I think we have more tailwinds than headwinds. And when we look at the plan that we put forward, it's a solid plan. And as I've reiterated several times, it doesn't include some real opportunities out there for us to even achieve better results.","So - and I don't - and really, I really think of that as sustainable results, not like up 1 year down, another year, that kind of thing. We pride ourselves on that element of consistency. And certainly, the capital plan demonstrates that, but also the opportunities ahead of us, they are more singular opportunities, more singles and doubles because, obviously, if we've gotten something like Wind Catcher, for example, front-end loaded, many of the integrated resource plan activities, but in this case, following these plans and the smaller projects that will come into play, and we'll see the continuing improvement.","I think we have a great case for the utility and for - the AEP utilities to own use assets. And depending upon the outcome of that, certainly, I would suspect some positive movement from that perspective.","So I feel good about it. I think I fell good about our culture of the organization. Our culture is around innovation, but it's also definitely around bending the O&M curve and addressing the issues in front of us. I mean, you look at the - for example, the weather last year in '17 versus last 2 years ago versus '18, very mild weather in '17. Earnings still came in where we really we're telling the market they would come in at.","'18, it was ahead, still came in where we said it would be and, obviously, beat the midpoint. So we had some resiliency that's built in our organization, the culture of the organization that will address to those kinds of results. So I'm optimistic.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And you comment or perhaps elaborate rather on some new developments in Oklahoma, you alluded to several potential positives riders and other new mechanisms is I'll leave it abroad in Oklahoma, you helped improve your earned ROEs. What does that mean with respect to another rate case? Or do you think, largely, you can achieve some of these through the current rate case? I know it's still pending, but I just want to understand at least from a - more of a process perspective how you're thinking about it here.","Nicholas Akins","Yes. Certainly, I don't want to presuppose the outcome. It'd be great if we got pretty considerable result in this rate case to get us back on an even footing. And certainly, Walmart, I guess, was one of the interveners that had - that's obviously performance-based ratemaking. I don't know about that. But certainly, looking forward, looking test years. So that'd be a great outcome to be able to look at forward-looking test years and as well some of the other - even - I think it was the Attorney General, maybe someone else, but was open to actually putting in an additional generation, additional distribution related rider activity.","So - and I still have work to do with the industrials. They were probably the most negative from an intervener perspective. But I really believe when you look at the discussions and what was centered versus the last case and the previous case, there at least now is recognition of the issues that we have and there's no doubt that the issues that we're discussing are well known by the commissioners and certainly the interveners. So I'm hopeful that it can certainly move to a more positive outcome.","What we're looking for, obviously, is progress, and we expect progress. And I think there has to be a clear message around that because we've languished since 2013 in Oklahoma, and that just has to change. And as a matter of fact, with the integrated resource plans we have filed in those various states, PSO in Oklahoma, obviously, is one of those, we just need a positive outcome rate case to make additional investments of that kind in the state. And obviously, the timing will work out to where we'll be able to make those kinds of decisions.","And then I think it's pretty well known now that also, Oklahoma is like our second corporate headquarters to us. With over 600 people, they are that focus on primarily the Western properties but also some of the Eastern activities as well.","Those are not PSO employees. They are AEP employees. So we should put AEP on top a building there so the Oklahoma knows that we do have a significant presence there. And I think that's important, and I think it's important to the livelihoods of the Tulsa area, but also I think it's important for this company to be able to have a central location like that, that we're able to operate out of at. So there's a lot of things in the context of all this that's probably becoming well known, and hopefully, will drive us to a better outcome.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you. Best of luck.","Nicholas Akins","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nicholas Akins","Morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi. Morning. Just to go back to your comments on the upper end of the - upper range of the 5% to 7%. Were those specific to 2019 guidance or they are more statement about your confidence in executing in that range over the 5-year plan? I wasn't quite clear when you set it at the outset.","Brian Tierney","Yes. We said 5% to 7% growth rate -- long-term growth rate over the future periods. And obviously, when you're paying renewables, they're not going to be in place until 2022. From a financial standpoint, that's part of it. So it's -- I would say it's geared more toward the long-term, but the trajectory should hold true. And there'll be things that come in during '19. There'd be things that come in during '20 and '21 and in the future years. So I think we have real opportunities in each and every year. But obviously, we're positioning this as part of our 5% to 7% growth rate.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So that upper range was going to be over the plan effectively?","Brian Tierney","Yes, that's right.","Jonathan Arnold","Yes. Great. And just the slowdown you saw in sales in the fourth quarter, can you give us a little more of a sense of why you remain confident keeping the 2019 sales estimate unchanged from EEI and maybe some color on what you're seeing early this year and what you're hearing from your customers?","Nicholas Akins","Yes. Certainly, Brian can cover this in more detail, but the way I'll see it is we're seeing somewhat of a tempered economy because of the trade issues. And as Brian mentioned, we have a lot of companies in our territory that are -- and certainly trade has an impact. And once those shackles come off, we believe the economy will continue on its previous trajectory. And so it's certainly difficult. The tailwind, that's going to happen.","But I think you're hearing some more promising dialogue from our national leaders. Let's hope that continues to be the case. But even then, I guess, probably, we look at customer counts. Customer counts is up considerably, so we're very happy with that. And the fundamentals, seeing this still being in place for the economy continued to roll along. From the world economy perspective, obviously, that would have an impact, but I think that's probably, again, tariff driven for many respects.","Brian Tierney","Jon, a lot of the growth that we anticipate in 2019 is going to be driven by the industrial space, and particularly industrial space in the oil and gas sector. We see a lot of company proposed and company invested -- customer invested in expansions in that area, and they are close at hand. We expect a lot of those to come on in 2019. In the fourth quarter, oil and gas was up 5.6%. In the third quarter, it was up 7.7%, and we expect that expansion to continue in 2019.","Jonathan Arnold","Brian, can you do the math for us, though? How much that wasn't oil and gas was down in 4Q?","Brian Tierney","Yes. In fourth quarter, it was down six-tenths of a percent non-oil and gas industrial. And in the third quarter, non-oil and gas industrial was up six-tenths of a percent.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And -- so obviously, your outlook is premised on an assumption with growth continues, you're talking about the plan, having building resilience in the company, talk to me a little bit about how resilient you think your plan is maybe if that view doesn't pan out.","Brian Tierney","Yes. I think if you look at -- and Nick talked about it, the change that we had year-on-year, '17 to '18, in terms of weather and how we were able to adjust O&M in both years to be able to hit our numbers, I think that demonstrates that resilience. So whether it's weather, whether it's loan growth, whether it's tariff impact or whatever, we actively manage our rate throughout the year, putting the brakes on, or the accelerator on as the case may be to get work done, what we need to get done. So I think just the weather year-on-year demonstrates that resiliency.","Nicholas Akins","And I think we're seeing sort of a -- if you put a microscope to it with the industrials impacted by the tariffs in particular, the commercials, particularly the supply to the major industrials and those kinds of establishments will have an impact. And I think we're probably seeing somewhat of an immediate impact there. And again, I think as the industrials start to pick back up, the commercials should start to come back as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha","First question, Nick or Brian, just reconfirming, when you talk about the 5% to 7% growth rate, what's the base of the change? Have you roll it forward? Or can you just remind us the base year for that?","Brian Tierney","It's midpoint of 2018 guidance, so it's off 3 85.","Ali Agha","Off 3 85, I got to you.","Brian Tierney","Yes, yes\u2026","Ali Agha","Okay. And then the renewables that you talked about in Ohio and in other places, the potential, if you do get approvals for those, can you just remind us in aggregate what kind of incremental CapEx we'd be talking about [indiscernible]?","Brian Tierney","Yes. So as for the renewables in Ohio that we've been talking about, it's not incremental CapEx, right? So the solar that we're talking about are PPAs, so that's not CapEx. For the competitive renewables, okay, so I'm not talking about Ohio, but I'm talking about Chuck's [ph] business, for the 5-year period, '19 forward, we anticipate spending about $2.2 billion over that 5-year period.","Nicholas Akins","But the renewables associated with the regulated side of the integrated resource plans of PSO and SWEPCO, that would be additional capital requirements based upon really what the ownership percentage winds up being.","Brian Tierney","And important to say, Nick, because we get these questions, the earnings associated with that are not reflected in our numbers today.","Nicholas Akins","That's right. That's right. And as far as Ohio is concerned, we elected not to participate in the construction of the project. But at the end of the day, when we get approval, there is an added component to the plan going forward that really reinforces our cap structure at AEP Ohio and evaluates the risk associated with the long-term PPA of that sort into construction. So you'll still seeing the earnings impact of the Ohio solar as well.","Ali Agh","I see. But just to be clear, the -- from a regulated rate base perspective, there's no incremental CapEx associated with the Ohio renewables? Did I\u2026","Nicholas Akins","No. And actually, when the bids come in in March, we'll have a better understanding of what the CapEx looks like.","Brian Tierney","That's for the consumer protection plan.","Nicholas Akins","Yes.","Ali Agh","Okay. And the CapEx numbers that you have in the slide, no changes there since EEI. Is that correct?","Brian Tierney","That's correct.","Ali Agh","And my last question on Oklahoma, Nick, I mean, again, assuming that the outcome is suboptimal or not as good as you would like it to be, what's your latest thinking there? Does that still give you hope that you can keep pushing and then maybe get to that end result? Or how are you thinking about Oklahoma post this current rate case?","Nicholas Akins","I think some of the positions taken by it in the interveners and others, there is some cause for hope that research recognition of the issues, but I'm not going to presuppose the outcome because I did that 2x before, and who knows what the outcome will be. Certainly, the issue should be very well known. I would say that just based on the response of the interveners, it's marginally better than what -- how they responded earlier. So I guess you can look at that as some positive, but we won't know until we get into the discussions with them or -- and go through this process. And really what matters is what in the Oklahoma commission comes up with in terms of running order, and they recognize the value that PSO provides to the state. And so that's what we're looking for. And if -- as I've said earlier, we will wait for those results and then we'll make determinations of what the next steps are.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Can you just clarify, when you say bend the O&M curve, is not decelerating O&M growth? Is that fattening or is it negative growth?","Brian Tierney","Negative.","Nicholas Akins","Yes, negative. We really -- by bending, we mean negative it.","Paul Ridzon","Can you kind of give a percentage kind of to think about [over] the next few years?","Brian Tierney","Yes. So we haven't said what that would be, Paul. If you look at our 2.8 to 3.1 that we've been in for about the last 8 years, we're looking to break through that and turn that negative, and we have plans to do that. It includes what we've done on lean activities, what we've done in process improvement. It includes automation, box. It includes partnering with third-party suppliers, like what we've done with an accounting and tax initiative with Accenture. And it's bringing all those things to build across the company that we're going to try and break through that $2.8 billion of non-spending that's not altered in past years.","Paul Ridzon","And then just to clarify, the 5% to 7% does not include renewables at PSO or SWEPCO or Chuck's business, is that correct?","Nicholas Akins","It includes the capital in Chuck's business, the $2.2 billion over the plan. It does not include the regulated renewables. It does not include Ohio.","Paul Ridzon","And then any projects that could be impacted by the situation in FERC?","Nicholas Akins","No, no. We don't see any projects impacted from that perspective because FERC obviously continues to advance transmission spending. And actually, the resource projects themselves, yes, we've moved to West transmission off of those. So I'm assuming it's on the transmission.","Paul Ridzon","Yes.","Nicholas Akins","We don't see any impacts there.","Paul Ridzon","And finally, with the 2.8% reduction in commercial sales, is that just [clearly] volatility? Or is there something along the line there?","Brian Tierney","We think it's clearly volatility. We don't see that continuing as a trend into 2019. Could have been associated with higher consumer interest costs in some demand side management that we across our system, but we don't see that as continuing into the new year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","So I just wanted to understand in Chuck's business, any exposure to PG&E or California Utilities that we should be aware or thinking about?","Nicholas Akins","No. That is the right answer. Very fortunate in that regard. A lot of our optics are with our municipal co-ops and used customers.","Praful Mehta","Okay, great. Dodged a bullet which is great. I guess just touching on the review, like strategic review that you've talked about in the past, and obviously, you've touched on Oklahoma already. But just on a strategic perspective, is there any view that we should be thinking about around any of the utilities? If they don't -- if you don't get the outcomes you're looking for, is that still on the table right now? Or is that too far out at least not a 2019 event?","Nicholas Akins","I think -- and the way we look at it is every utility that we have, we wanted to grow and prosper. And to the extent that they can grow and prosper and have a proper regulatory treatment, it's a great outcome. I think a couple 3 years ago, I guess, 3 years, we're talking about Kentucky and Kentucky's turned around. We focused on 2 things, the regulatory relationship and the compact that we have there, but also our emphasis placed upon economic development in the state of Kentucky. And that picture has turned around markedly. For PSO, PSO is now in the radar screen and probably in the middle of the radar screen because we definitely want to be a part of the economic development picture of Oklahoma, and we definitely want to be able to move forward in a very positive way on investments that benefit the customer experience in that state. So the way you look at it is we have a set of assets. And if they perform well, fine. If they're electronically underperforming, then we have to take steps in some fashion to alleviate that situation for our shareholders. And really, the focus because many times, when you have an underachiever, a lot of effort goes into trying to reconcile the situation. And there are some that say that PSO doesn't have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. And that is just so far from the truth. It's just incredible because we run 7 utilities, and we run those utilities in much the same fashion. And we know what it takes to provide the customer services required, and PSO has been at the top of the list in terms of its performance. And I really believe that if you're a residential customer, if you're an industrial customer, you should you really take a hard look at what's happening there in Oklahoma, and it could very well have an impact on not only the presence in the future, but also the customer experience itself, and we don't want that to happen. So as we get these assets, obviously, we'll continue to make steps to further optimize our portfolio based upon what we see.","Praful Mehta","Okay. That's super helpful. And then -- and finally, you guys have been able to manage through different [indiscernible] years. It sounds like if you do have the shackles that are continuing to stay, let's say, from [Dallas] and other constraints from a macro perspective, and it doesn't work in your favor, is there any time that we should be worried about the '19 profile? Or do you think you have enough tools in the toolkit to manage to run those potentially macro challenges around the earnings for '19?","Nicholas Akins","Yes, I think we're fine. We've had -- and if you look at [over] the last 2 years, 3 years, maybe even longer than that we've had perturbations of customer class going up and down and actually residential going down has more of an impact than commercial or industrial. And so the mix obviously has an impact because the margins are different based upon each customer class. But our service territory is very diverse, very -- certainly, every part of the economy is represented. And our customer mix is really pretty resilient in and of itself. So there's a lot of internal levers that continue to adjust for one another from that perspective. But at the same time, we will adjust when the economy is -- if the economy were to chronically be suffering, and we saw that on a continual success of a quarterly trend, then we would certainly make adjustments that were necessary to ensure that we remain financially healthy, and we intend on doing that. But I really believe we're in good shape in that respect. And we'll watch this next quarter and the quarter after, and hopefully, we'll see some progress in the federal government side. I think certainly immigration needs to get solved and the 2 parties need to get talking to one another again, and maybe that will warm them up and then they'll move to greater and better better things for the economy, but they've got to get going.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI.","Greg Gordon ","So just two quick questions. One, just to be clear, you said the anchor for the 5% to 7% is 3 85 in '18?","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Nicholas Akins","Yes.","Greg Gordon ","Okay. So I mean, I guess this is just logically correct, but the high end of the guidance range for '19, which put -- would put you above 7%. You're not -- this is more a long-term target than an annual we're going to be tight inside the stance type of guidance? [indiscernible] ","Nicholas Akins","That's right. ROE is in the midpoint of the 5% to 7%. And then you look at the opportunities available to us in that 5% to 7% bandwidth, it's -- like I said, it's more tailwinds than headwinds.","Greg Gordon ","And then just one final question because there's just -- there's been some conversation about this. You continue to give us a financial forecast that even though the absolute level of leverage has come up since 2013, the FFO to that metric continues to be really resilient just around 18%. And you're still confident that through this forecast period, you can maintain -- there'll probably be no deterioration in your FFO to that metrics.","Nicholas Akins","We haven't said that. We do anticipate that it will [decrease] over the time period, and we expect it to approach [to] 15% level during the term of the forecast.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, okay. Well, that's a higher number than other people have prognosticated anyway. So just wanted to make sure we understood what you thought the trend was.","Nicholas Akins","We're very interested in the FFO to that percentage, and we intend to maintain our credit rating.","Greg Gordon ","Okay. So you think 15% is sort of regular trend down to over this forecast period?","Brian Tierney","In that area, yes.","A - Nicholas Akins","Thanks, Greg.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Angieszka Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angieszka Storozynski","I have a bigger picture question. So we are hearing about this precipitous drop in prices for solar power and that more and more senior customers are signing contract with PPA simply because they see it as a way to hedge against fatality in falling natural gas prices that also seem to be at places that are not below favorable solar power curves. So 2 questions. Do you see it as a risk to your vertically integrated utilities given that you do have conventional generation assets? And number two, is there a way to tap into this growth beyond that $2.2 billion that you're planning to spend on renewables on the commercial side?","Nicholas Akins","I would say, first of all, we don't see a risk if we're doing it, and we are doing it. And I think we are in discussions with many customers about what their specific resource needs are. We're also looking at various technologies that enable that to happen in some of these large customers. So we really have an opportunity to engage in that discussion. But the other part of it, too, is you see solar, you see energy storage. Those types of applications continue to advance, and that -- and certainly on the transportation sector, you're making up whatever you're going to lose. You're going to make it up with channel growth -- sales channel growth, particularly associated with the advent of electric transportation. So there's real opportunities for us to engage in that, and I think AEP is in a very favorable situation of being able to focus on those types of issues as opposed to something that some calamity that's occurred and real intent of making sure we maintain our operational excellence so that we can focus on those particular types of activities. And certainly, that's happening not only on the regulated side. and obviously, we're having to work with the regulators to broaden the perspective there. For example, continuity of service is not just a distribution line going in the home. It's a distribution with energy storage throughout [indiscernible] outages and really drive toward continuity of service as opposed to just basic service. Certainly, what we're doing with smart cities, what we're doing with other applications and engaging customers in a very substantial sense, those are things that we see as the future, and we are not going to get left behind from that perspective. As a matter of fact, from a technology standpoint, we're at the forefront of these technologies across the gamut. So we have pilots running in every one of our operating companies on various aspects of these technologies, and we intend on that channel growth to occur.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","And now I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa, please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2013 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks, Bette Jo. So today, I'm happy to report that AEP had a good third quarter. With our performance in this quarter, we have decided to modify our guidance range for 2013 to the upper end of the guidance range. Originally, it was $3.05 to $3.25 range we had previously reported. We're changing that to $3.15 to $3.25 with a $3.20 midpoint.","Despite the continued overall stagnation of the economy, the continuous improvement in cost savings initiatives that our employees continue to focus on have provided the company's ability to fully react to the current environment. These sustainable initiatives and others to follow will continue to provide benefits to our customers and our shareholders.","Coupled with our previous announcement by our board to increase the dividend payable by $0.01 a share to $0.50 a share, these actions have been consistent with our plan to ensure continued positive performance for our shareholders. We've increased our dividend by 3.72% on the annualized basis, with a 61% payout ratio, which is within our 60% to 67% -- 60% to 70% targeted range.","The third quarter came in at $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.10 per share on an operating earnings basis. The difference this quarter is mainly attributable to the surprising decision by the PUCT to include -- the Public Utility Commission of Texas to include AFUDC and the cost cap related to the Turk power plant at SWEPCO, and a smaller impairment related to the Big Sandy scrubber project cost that was disallowed as part of the order in Kentucky approving 50% of the Mitchell plant to be transferred to Kentucky Power rate base. I'll discuss these cases in more detail a little bit later.","But so far this year, we stand at $2.33 a share on a GAAP basis and $2.63 per share on an operating basis, with the differences attributable to the impairments that I just mentioned, along with other impairments and benefits from previous quarters that we reported.","Despite the impairments of the last quarter, we performed well from an operating earnings perspective and I'm proud of our employees' efforts to control costs as an outcome of our repositioning efforts and continuous improvements. Also solid regulatory recovery, benefits and continued positive transmission performance have contributed as well.","We're pleased to see increases in the commercial load, primarily in Texas and Ohio, for the third quarter, but our residential and industrial load continues to be challenged. The makeup of the top of load though, combined with the margins in each class, has resulted in a small year-to-date financial impact. However, the oscillating nature of the quarter-to-quarter load cycles, as we've looked at previous quarters that we've reported, indicate a still tenuous economy. I sort of call it a whack-a-mole economy because the growth in each sector has not been well synchronized to indicate the true overall economic growth.","Industrial load continues to be -- to lag across many sectors, including primary metals in mining, partially offset, though, in our service territory by the shale gas activity in Texas and Ohio.","Moving to the major regulatory activities during the quarter, we were pleased overall with the Kentucky asset transfer order. We received permission to transfer 50% of the Mitchell plant to Kentucky Power and put in place a $44 million surcharge while freezing base rates for a period of time. We also keep the offsets in sales margins and the capacity payments, so it turned out to be a good order. The Kentucky commission did disallow, as I mentioned earlier, certain scrubber project-related expenses that we had earlier.","The West Virginia case continues -- we continue to wait for a commission order, which we expect relatively soon. But based on the outcome that we saw in the FE, FirstEnergy transfer order, we expect to have a reasonable outcome there as well.","Regarding the Texas rate case order involving Turk -- the Turk power plant-related cost, we were pleased that the plant was found to be prudent and the imposition, obviously, the retroactive rates that we had mentioned earlier to -- almost to the beginning of the year. But we were disappointed that the Texas Commission surprisingly included AFUDC in the cost cap related to the Turk construction costs. We'll be following a rehearing request with the commission to show that the case history and record does not support such an outcome. To not allow quip recovery that we had requested, and then also to not allow AFUDC recovery beyond what was clearly a cap on the construction cost to build the unit, would send, I believe, a bad policy message on a prudent incurred generation investment. We're indeed hopeful that after reviewing the record, the PUCT will reconsider its decision, particularly for a state that desperately needs to incent new generation capacity.","We continue to be committed to delivering 4% to 6% earnings growth off of our original 2013 guidance. AEP believes that the cultural transformation efforts, along with the ingenuity of our employees to achieve cost savings through our continuous improvement efforts, will ultimately mitigate the headwinds of a lack of load growth. We believe our industry is no longer about just generation, transmission and distribution, but is focused on infrastructure investment, particularly in the transmission area and distribution, and the customer and employee experiences that include technological changes, and of course optimization of our portfolio of assets. So our company is transforming from that perspective.","In November, the EEI will be discussing specific cost savings expectations in areas such as lean generation, lean wires, procurement, lean IT, corporate services from a lean perspective, the unregulated generation cost reduction initiatives that Chuck Zebula and his team are working on, as well as other growth-related initiative areas, such as transmission expansion and more effective cost allocation for capital -- capital allocations, excuse me. This detail will demonstrate our plan to achieve our 4% to 6% earnings growth rate plans for the future. So stay tuned for that.","Now, as I turn to the equalizer chart, I call it my equalizer chart on Page 4 of the presentation, I'll sort of go through state-by-state, jurisdiction by jurisdiction where we stand. The Ohio Power is showing up at 12.3%. Keep in mind that 12.3% does not include off-system sales, if you are thinking about it from a SEET perspective. If you exclude the offsets in sales from the 12.3%, that brings you down below the 12% SEET cap. So I know people have questions about that. So -- but it also, from an Ohio perspective, it doesn't include the $435 million of plant write-downs that we've taken this year. So when you look at Ohio, you have to think about that from a consideration perspective.","For West Virginia, we continue to see improvement in West Virginia. We expect, as I said earlier, the order is expected pretty soon. So we would expect that to continue to increase.","And then on Kentucky, it's a sort of a -- it is one of our smaller jurisdictions and we had a Big Sandy 2 outage here in the third quarter that had some O&M expense associated with that. So it's slightly lower than it was, but it continues in its positive trajectory as well, particularly with the Kentucky order now in place.","And at I&M, that continues to improve. You're seeing -- because it is a 12-month rolling average, the recent rate case activity will continue to enable that to improve.","PSO is pretty steady. It has decreased a little bit, but that's because, obviously, PSO is doing what it needs to do to continue to invest in its distribution territories.","So, and then SWEPCO, we expect that to continue to improve because it's not fully reflected in terms of rates, the recent rate case development. It will continue to improve as well.","And then AEP Texas is doing well. And then from a Transmission Operations standpoint, we continue to have heavy investments in transmission, so that return has come down slightly, but that's because of the heavy investment that's occurring and maybe a lag associated with that.","So overall, I'd say the equalizer chart across the area is looking good. And there's just a slight change, I guess, from the previous quarter. But overall, it's a 10.3% overall regulated operations ROE, which I think is pretty favorable in this environment.","So we've had a good, strong quarter. And we certainly are looking for continued activity in November at the EEI meeting and certainly Brian will talk a little bit more about the detail that we'll be providing there.","So at this point, I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We're going to try a new format today for discussing comparative year-on-year results. In an effort to avoid repetition and tedium, I'll handle both quarterly and year-to-date reconciliations on the same slide, focusing primarily on the quarterly results, but adding color to the year-to-date results, as needed. If we find that this new method is not helpful, then we'll revert to the old format next time. In any event, the traditional slides that you are used to are in the appendix to the presentation.","So here we go. On Slide 5, you will see that operating earnings for the third quarter were $533 million, or $1.10 per share compared to $496 million or $1.02 per share recorded last year, an $0.08 per share improvement.","For the year-to-date period, our operating earnings were $1.277 billion, or $2.63 per share versus last year's results of $1.255 billion or $2.59 per share, an improvement of $0.04 per share.","Stepping through the detail from the top to bottom, you can see that the quarter was adversely affected by a combination of certain Ohio transition items that were unfavorable, $0.03 per share versus last year. This effect on earnings was driven by an increase in customer switching, net of the capacity deferrals and lower capacity payments from competitive retail energy suppliers. On a year-to-date basis, this item represented a significant drag to earnings for an unfavorable comparison of $0.24 per share.","As expected in our guidance, the effective income tax rate was unfavorable $0.04 per share for the quarter due to unfavorable year-on-year tax to book differences, accounted for on a flow-through basis, as well as positive adjustments to state income tax returns that were recorded in 2012. For the year-to-date, this item is now unfavorable $0.09 per share for the same reasons as for the quarter.","Allowance for funds used during construction or AFUDC was off $0.02 per share for the third quarter and $0.07 per share for the year-to-date, due primarily to the startup of the Turk plant in December of 2012.","Off-System Sales margins, net of sharing, were down $0.02 per share for the quarter. This decline was largely driven by prior period true-ups of PJM-related expenses that more than offset the effect of increased volumes and prices this year.","For the year-to-date, Off-System Sales compared unfavorably to last year by $0.04 per share. The decline for this period was driven by lower RPM capacity revenues that hurt results by $0.03 per share, as well as the PJM-expense items mentioned for the quarter.","As you can see, both AEP River Operations and our regulated retail load were unchanged and not drivers for the quarterly results. The September year-to-date decline for River Operations reflects the lingering impact of drought conditions from the back half of last year into the first half of this year. The year-to-date decline in regulated retail load is driven by the lower industrial demand across much of our service territories. As will become clear later in the presentation, the decrease in retail margins is not as large as the decrease in retail load. I will further discuss the economy and our Retail Sales data in the upcoming slides.","Weather played an unfavorable role in our earnings comparison for the quarter. Temperatures were milder than last summer, adversely affecting results by $0.08 per share. This result for the quarter was more than offset by the favorable cushion that we had built up through June. Weather for the year-to-date period is now $0.02 per share favorable versus normal.","O&M expense, net of offset items, was favorable $0.06 per share for the quarter, and that brings our year-to-date results almost even to last year. The lower O&M expense for the quarter was driven by lower storm and employee-related expenses, partially offset by higher transmission service expenses.","Transmission operations added $0.01 per share for the quarter and $0.05 per share for the year-to-date period, reflecting our continuous significant investment in this area.","Other items for the quarterly comparison were favorable by $0.05 per share. And for the year-to-date period, positive $0.09 per share. The improvement for both periods was driven by lower long-term interest expense, lower depreciation expenses and an increase in third-party transmission revenues.","Finally, rate changes were favorable by $0.15 per share for the third quarter. This result pushes our favorable year-to-date comparison to $0.36 per share. The improvement in earnings in both periods reflect successful regulatory outcomes in multiple jurisdictions.","As you can see, we continue to overcome the challenges created by Ohio. In spite of these challenges, we have executed on our plan to invest in our regulated operations, grow our transmission business and control expenses. Our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter allow us to narrow our operating earnings guidance for the year to the upper half of the previously stated range of $3.05 per share to $3.25 per share. We are narrowing guidance for 2013 to $3.15 to $3.25 per share, as Nick stated earlier.","Also, as I mentioned earlier, I want to spend some time looking at our regulated load so far this year. Turning to Slide 6, you can see in the lower right quadrant that weather-normalized load was down 1.5% for the quarter and 1.9% for the year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in Retail Sales.","You've probably already noticed from looking at the bottom half of the slide, that the decline in Retail Sales is primarily driven by industrial sales. Residential sales, shown in the upper left quadrant, were down 1.8% for the quarter, which offset the strong first quarter results, bringing the year-to-date growth essentially flat.","We continue to see modest customer growth of 0.7% in our Western service territories, but none to speak of in East.","Average uses per customer has declined, as more customers are utilizing efficient appliances in their homes and taking advantage of various energy efficiency programs.","In the upper right quadrant, you can see that commercial sales were up 1.3% for the quarter, which offset the weak second quarter results, making the year-to-date growth essentially flat. Commercial growth in the third quarter was evenly spread across the AEP service territory.","In total, year-to-date commercial sales are down compared to last year. However, in Texas and Ohio, where we've seen stronger employment growth, we are seeing commercial sales gains compared to last year.","Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you see the declines I mentioned earlier, where the industrial class is down 3.9% for the quarter and 5.1% for the year. If you exclude the effect of our largest customer, which had been operating at reduced levels, the declines would have been 1.3% and 2.7% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. While not minimizing the importance of these declines, it's important to note that the effect on gross margin associated with industrial declines is less than in other customer classes. The average realization from industrial customers is less than half that for residential.","As I've done previously, let me stop here and share an update on the economy within AEP's footprint. AEP's service territory continues to experience economic growth, although the growth has slowed somewhat recently, as we are starting to see the impact of the federal fiscal austerity measures. This is particularly true on our Western footprint, where there are a number of military bases and a higher percentage of federal government employees than in our Eastern territory.","As you know, a large part of the sequestration cuts were targeted around defense spending. Therefore, it is not surprising that for the quarter, GDP growth in AEP's Western footprint was a mere 0.1% compared to 0.8% in our Eastern territory and an estimated 1.4% for the U.S.","Fortunately, the employment statistics, which are a better indicator of electricity sales and GDP, are not as weak. Job growth in AEP's Western footprint is up 1.6% and is in step with the U.S., which is at 1.7%, while growth in the East has moderated recently to 0.6%.","Even though our employment growth had been consistently stronger than the U.S. over the past several years, the economy in AEP service territory is not fully recovered from the recession. Most of the employment growth over the last year has been in the service sector, which is consistent with our commercial sales class growth and has been the strongest in Texas and Ohio, as we mentioned earlier. Manufacturing employment, however, remains weak.","With that segue, let's turn to Slide 7 where you'll see the quarterly results from our 5 largest industrial sectors. Our largest sector, primary metals, was down 18% from last year's third quarter. Earlier, I mentioned the curtailed production of our largest customer and excluding that effect, this sector would have been down closer to 8%. That customer has now fully ceased operations and so we expect to see this impact through the third quarter of next year. We are seeing other metals customers curtailing operations until market conditions improve and some are taking advantage of the situation to retool their operations.","Chemical manufacturing is up 1.4% for the quarter, despite the year-to-date decline of 1.9%. If the global markets for chemicals recover, while natural gas prices remain low, this export industry is in position to experience recovery.","Petroleum and coal products are down 2.1% for the quarter versus the same period last year. This is due to a couple of specific refineries that were down for maintenance in the third quarter. Excluding these 2 customers, sales to this sector were flat for the quarter and would have been up 2.3% for the year.","The mining sector, excluding oil and gas, was down 2% for the quarter. This continuing decline reflects the impact of recent mild winters, low natural gas prices and weak demand from utilities and metals producers. Approximately 90% of AEP mining load is located in our Eastern footprint.","Paper manufacturing was up 2.8% for the quarter, driven by higher demand in Ohio, which more than offset lower demand in the West. Although not in our top 5 sectors, we continue to see growing sales in the oil and gas extraction and pipeline transportation sectors, driven by continued gains related to shale gas activity.","Turning to Slide 8 will give us an opportunity to review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total capitalization continues to improve and now stands at 54.4%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to total debt are solidly BBB and Baa2 at 4.6x and 19.7%, respectively.","On the bottom left-hand side of the graph, you will see that our qualified pension liability funding has increased to 98%. The company has aggressively funded this liability over the last 3 years to the benefit of our employees, retirees, shareholders and bondholders. In addition to the funding, the company has been working hard to match the duration of the assets to the liabilities and to de-risk the plan as it approaches full funding.","In addition to the pension results, our other post-employment benefit liability is now more than fully funded at 104.3%. This is due to some changes that were made last year in our post-retirement medical plans.","Finally, let me give you some updates on some recent financing activity. Last week, AEP Transmission Company, LLC, priced commitments for $400 million of senior unsecured notes in maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years. This company is the holding company for the transcos that are in our existing service territories and seek to add incremental transmission investment for the benefit of our customers at federally regulated rates. The offering was a fantastic success, with spreads comparable to our larger rated utility companies, and in some cases, even lower than current indications, demonstrating the strong appetite of investors for transmission-specific debt. More than half of the $400 million offering was for 30-year maturities, including some delayed draws. Many thanks to our investors and to those who believed that this business format would attract significant amounts of well-priced capital. It is working out just as we said it would.","Lastly, on September 20, we received a financing order from the West Virginia Public Service Commission, authorizing the securitization of the ENEC balance of $376 million plus financing costs. We anticipate securitizing this balance in the next few weeks as we work to finalize the offering. It should be clear from the improving metrics on this page that management is committed to a strong balance sheet and to our investment-grade credit rating. We will continue to demonstrate spending discipline, careful capital allocation and thoughtful access to the debt capital markets.","Finally, let me preview some of the detail that we will be sharing next month at the EEI Fall Financial Conference. We will provide support for the company's 4% to 6% operating earnings growth rate, off of original 2013 guidance. We will show how the growth comes from putting capital to work for the benefit of our customers and then doing the hard work of getting the increased investment appropriately reflected in rates. We will provide detail on the continuous improvement plans that the company has embarked on. We will share the initiatives we have committed to for 2013 and describe the level of success we have had with those initiatives. We will also discuss the plans we have for 2014 and what we think the magnitude of those opportunities are. This should provide some insight into how we plan to fill the earnings gap presented by the low RPM auction results.","We have found a framework for continuous improvement that has worked well for us for over a year now. We evaluate the size of the opportunity and then look to our employees to generate and analyze the ideas to capture the value. The employees who do the work of this company have the experience and skill to show us how to provide better service and how to do it more efficiently.","We will provide more detail on the range of investment opportunity available to our transcos and transmission JVs. In the recent past, we have only shown the investment opportunity of approved projects or those that do not need additional approvals. In November, we will provide more detail about those projects as well as an upside case, which includes currently identified opportunities. This should give investors transparency into the growth potential of our transmission transcos and JVs. We will also provide more detail into the cost structure and earnings opportunity of AEP generation resources, our competitive generation affiliate. This will be a relatively small portion of our business going forward, but one that has generated a lot of interest by investors.","Finally, we will provide some insights into the growth opportunity created by investment on behalf of our customers in our regulated wires and integrated utility companies. These regulated businesses will be the lion's share of AEP's business going forward and we will show how putting capital to work to benefit our customers will allow us to grow earnings over time.","In November, we will be providing a lot of information, designed to provide insight, transparency and credibility to our investment and growth goals. At this time, we do not have plans to make any strategic announcements at the Fall EEI Conference, but rather details on how we plan to grow the company over time.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question today comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Thanks for so much detail on your perspective on sales growth. When you look at -- for planning purposes, when you look out over the next 12 to 24 months, and you normalize for a lot of the idiosyncrasies and what's going on in your service territory, what are sort of the range of expectations for sort of best case, worst case, base case sales growth going forward?","Nicholas K. Akins","Greg, we've been assuming that load growth would be relatively flat. And that's what we're assuming in our modeling because you can't ignore what's going on with the economy. You can't -- and really, it's hard to tell what impact it would have in the future. And everybody's expecting -- you talk to economists and every quarter it seems like the next quarter we're going to see an economic recovery. Well, that's been going on for years. So we're being deliberately conservative on that. And we'll continue to be that way.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, Nick, that's great. So your plans to drive the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration are sort of anchored in the assumption that you're going to have to plow through a relatively flat sales growth picture?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. I'd say it really is flat, flat load growth. It's on certainly cost containment through the efficiency efforts that we have ongoing and capital allocation. Those are the areas where we can get more concurrent growth and better ROEs.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And Nick, on the earnings growth aspiration, is there a specific end date to that? Or is your goal at EEI going to be to show people that you don't just have the ability to grow at that rate through '15, but that you have the ability to offset sort of post-'15 headwinds and continue to grow at that rate?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, you got it. It's -- we'll show that, based upon that original 2013 guidance range that we gave and if you look at that, the bottom line 4%, the top line 6%, we'll be in that range.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Final question. The pension funding looks amazing. We've got a tax and accounting team here that's done some analysis here at ISI on the impact of higher discount rates on all the companies in the S&P 500. And utilities in particular, given their large pension, seem to be particularly large beneficiaries of that going into 2014. As you look at your planning, is it -- should it be our expectation that your pension -- GAAP pension expenses should decline dramatically next year? Or are you going to do things like take down the expected return because you're now so well-funded, which would mitigate the impact of that decline?","Nicholas K. Akins","Go ahead, Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Greg, it's Brian. So we have, over time, been derisking our pension portfolio, shifting more of the assets into fixed income and away from equities as we become more fully funded. We're anticipating that in a step-down basis, our pension costs will start to approach our annual draw on the pension, which will be close to about $100 million. So next year, we anticipate it will be close to $125 million and then we expect the expense over time will approximate that $100 million per year level.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And what was your pension expense budgeted for this year?","Brian X. Tierney","We're anticipating it to be closer to $200 million, about $175 million, $180 million.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the load reg questions Greg was asking, I guess, if we were to draw it out and you think about the breakdown in customer growth on a more durable basis, do you think the commercial side continues to show momentum and the laggards are going to be industrial, residential? Or how do you think within a flat load growth profile do you see the customer classes behaving?","Nicholas K. Akins","That's a great question. We see all 3 classes continuing to oscillate. And there's a lot of discussion to whether just the general nature of the American economy moving to an industrial manufacturing to more of a service economy. That would bode well for the commercial side of things. On the other hand, you want some fundamental base of industrial and manufacturing to enable the sustaining nature of commercial and ultimately, residential growth. But to us, I think, I guess, the beauty of AEP is that we're in so many areas of the country. And as Brian talked about, different parts of the country are experiencing different types of growth. And based on that diversity and the diversity of the margins related to the components of the classes of customers, I think we're probably in pretty good stead to remain, at least from the overall perspective, being relatively flat going forward. It would -- when you look at the components of the economy, though, in our service territory with the shale gas activity, with the energy-related economy that we have in place, if we really start to see consumption pick up by a vibrant economy, and there's more focus on the energy infrastructure and the energy resources of this country, it's going to bode well for our service territory. So you could see, I mean, you could see those kinds of measures pick up. But like I said earlier, that's all conjecture on all of our parts at this point in time. I think it's going to take more of a federal and state policy and regulatory policy that supports that kind of thing. And also, with the tax issues and things that need to be worked out by the federal government, you're not -- I mean, you won't see much growth until we see some clarity around how to invest in this country. And when you see that, I think you'll see a different makeup of what we're dealing with from a load cycle perspective. But like I said, we've been very conservative about it. We'll continue to be conservative until we see indications otherwise. But when you look at the shale gas offsets, the chemical manufacturing sort of picking up a little bit, that's sort of an early indication that maybe something's happening here. But it's hard to tell.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Nick, just on the shale gas-related activity, how much of your industrial load is that today? And can you just give some color on how much that's been growing as an underlying class since it doesn't get broken out?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. Brian's got the detail on that.","Brian X. Tierney","I do. Let me get to the proper page here. And I'm having trouble finding it. So the pipeline and oil and gas extraction are smaller percentages. It's in the 3% to 5% of our total industrial load. But the pipeline transportation, in particular, grew at 26% for the quarter and then well into double digits for the year-to-date period. So although it's smaller portions of our industrial load, the growth in those areas has been spectacular.","Nicholas K. Akins","And when you look at the Eagle Ford shale area, for example, there's a whole list of industrial and manufacturing facilities that are coming online in Texas. Now some of them have been delayed in terms of their startup, but you can see that kind of activity when you have a vibrant and shale gas play in operation. And you're now seeing Cline, and there's another shale gas operation now in West Texas that's picking up as well. Oil and gas activity is definitely a positive for the territory. And I think that's why you see some of the commercial activity in Ohio pick up as well, although the Utica Shale isn't as far along as the Eagle Ford shale yet.","Brian X. Tierney","Let me give you some more detail on that, Dan. Oil and gas extraction is 3.8% of total industrial load. Pipeline transportation, our 10th largest sector, is 3.8% of industrial. And oil and gas extraction is up almost 27% relative to the pre-recession peak. And the pipeline transportation is up 16%, relative to the pre-recession peak. So some pretty significant gains there over the last couple of years.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So on the dividend increase, obviously, 2 increases within 3 quarters here, and I get a cumulative total of about 6.4% increase. What can we take away from this in terms of likely future growth in the dividend? And when should we expect dividend change announcements in the future?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, I probably can't comment on the dividend change in the future. But I can say, this is consistent with what the board has laid out for us in terms of the expected range, the payout ratio, the 60% to 70%. And they've also said that our dividend payout will be commensurate with the earnings capability of the company. So those things, as long as it continues to play the way it is, then we should be in good shape.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And how about -- so -- and Nick, you can't tell us anything about should we expect dividend increases in the first quarter as previously, going back to that pattern? Or will it just be uncertain for a period of time?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, typically, we evaluate dividends in October. But like I said, we'll have to look at the situation at the time with our board and make that determination. But typically, it's October.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. Fair enough. And one other area to touch on. Previously, you've had a slide where you show 2014 EPS range of $3.15 to $3.45, but I didn't see that in here. Are we just in a sort of quiet period for 2014 at this stage? Or how -- should we continue to think about 4% to 6% growth in 2014, off of the previous range for 2013?","Nicholas K. Akins","We haven't changed '14. That guidance is still good.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on load growth. Apologies for the load growth questions, but you had mentioned that in your long-term guidance, you're assuming flat load growth. And we've seen some challenging quarters here in terms of load growth. If load growth were to continue to trend negative, as it has been, how much of a headwind is that to your overall growth aspirations?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, it just depends on the components of what the load decreases are. Because we have a lot more margin in not only commercial, but residential as well. So it will depend on the components of it. But I can tell you that if we continue to see load deterioration, then we believe we have the process in place to respond to that. And I keep saying, this business is about optimization now. And you got to remember, too, that I don't think load growth gives you the entire picture of the earnings capability of the company because we're having to reinvest in the grid. We're having to invest, not only from the distribution perspective, but also the transmission enhancements associated with it. And keep in mind, too, that we are producing earnings on the retail side beyond our own service territory. So typically, we've always looked at load because it was all like one integrated utility. And we had -- we only had the load increases and really, it's pretty measurable in terms of what the investment capability was. But we're sort of in a different picture now, where there would be more contributions from different areas. So -- but as that load changes, we'll obviously be watching the makeup of that load, the financial impact of the margin capability of that load and making adjustments accordingly.","Brian X. Tierney","So to Nick's point, Stephen, some of the challenges that we've seen in industrial, so far, we know we're going to see, at least, through the third quarter of next year because of what's happened at that large primary metals customer. And to some degree, that will be offset by what we're seeing in chemicals, pipeline transportation, oil and gas extraction. But -- and this year, we've seen that we are down, overall load, 1.7% year-to-date, but it's only impacted earnings by $0.02 so far. So Nick's point that the combination of where we have load increases or declines makes a huge difference as to what our results will be.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, and the large customer that shut down, even looking at that contract -- and it was a special contact, obviously. When you look at that kind of financial impact, it was still negligible and we continued with the earnings guidance that we provided. So I think you have to look at it, really, on a customer-by-customer basis and what type of customer they are.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair point. And a lot of your growth is in areas like transmission that, really, aren't -- isn't dependent on load growth outlook.","Nicholas K. Akins","That's right.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess, just shifting over to the merchant side of the world, we've seen a more challenging gas environment. Gas space has been trending negative. As you think about the long-term merchant earnings outlook and think about the future, how does that factor in? Is that sort of in your current thinking, in terms -- like, it's moving so quickly. But just curious how you look at the headwinds in terms of the kind of the local gas price and the impact on power prices.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, it absolutely is in our thinking. Gas prices have remained relatively low for a long period of time. And I still believe they're going to remain low for the foreseeable future. And it's something that we have to adjust to from an unregulated standpoint. And Chuck Zebula, who has taken over the generation, the unregulated generation side of the group with the retail piece of it, he is very focused on bringing down his cost structure to enable his business to continue to operate in a positive fashion. And you have -- I mean, there are several things you have to look at. One is, certainly, the natural gas picture. The other is the capacity markets themselves and the inability for those markets to actually pay long-term investors in an appropriate fashion. That's something that we are working on as well. And then also, the impact of distributed generation. Although it's pretty minimal in our territory, you think about those things. They're forcing functions for us to reform our business so that we can succeed in that kind of environment. And that's what we're focused on and our board is very focused on that as well.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Jonathan Arnold. Well most -- a couple of things were already answered, but I just wanted to -- on Greg's question about how long your -- whether there's a definitive endpoint to your 4% to 6% growth aspiration? I wasn't sure you really addressed that piece of the question.","Nicholas K. Akins","No, that's our long-term growth forecast, and it's as far as we can see at this point.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, just as you look at it -- assuming your load forecast of around 0 is the scenario you're dealing with, roughly how much of the 4% to 6% is coming from costs and continuous improvement and investment? Can you give us kind of a little preview of maybe some of these EEI buildups? Is it half from cost savings, half from growth investments or some other mix?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, we'll certainly have more detail on that in November. But we obviously are making pretty good headway from a continuous improvement and cost-reduction perspective. But you have to also think about rates that have been put into effect, the transmission investment and all kinds of things together. So I wouldn't look at one single area to determine what we're doing. So we'll certainly have more detail on that in November.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When did Ormet quit taking power and what's the strategy with Ohio as to potentially mitigate that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, they shut down, I guess, completely just probably 2, 3 weeks ago. And right now, there is no plan. I mean, obviously, from an Ohio perspective, that was taken before the Ohio Commission. The Ohio Commission dealt with it in the best way that they could. I think it was a situation where the world markets had a tremendous impact on all of the primary metals suppliers. And that's really -- I think that's going to be the primary driver as to what can happen in the future, relative to those particular types of businesses. So at this point, we're continuing on as business as usual. Although, it's unfortunate that you wind up in a situation where so many jobs are impacted. But we have a lot of customers who have that kind of experience. And certainly, we did everything we could possibly do, from a special contract perspective and from other areas and working with the commission, to enable them to stay in business as long as possible. So I think we did everything we could do. The commission, in our belief, did everything that they could do. And I think it's a matter of the business case itself supporting that kind of business in the future.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And can you just -- I don't know if you've already shut the door on this next question. What's your latest thinking about Ohio generation strategically?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I get that question a lot. From an Ohio generation perspective, we are still on path to -- our first course of action, obviously, is to complete corporate separation, to get that done. And then secondly, Chuck is busily working on what his cost structure's going to look like in the future to succeed. And even a $59 per megawatt day environment, we need to fully understand what that means. And also, we're pursuing changes within the PJM market construct to enable long-term investment decisions to be made. Those are prerequisites for us to determine what the nature of that business is and does it fit within our portfolio of companies. And I can't say, at this point, the timing of that. But certainly, I can tell you that our management, just like our investors, are fully engaged in trying to determine that result. And our board, obviously, is very focused on those types of issues as well. So it's not that we are sitting and waiting for corporate separation to complete before we start thinking about it. I can assure you that a lot of thought's being given, not only in terms of what milestones need to occur, but also, in terms of the information we need to make that kind of decision for the future.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just on the topic of corporate separation, could you just clarify what are the remaining steps to get that done?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So we have the West Virginia case that we ultimately want to complete. And then there's 3 FERC-related cases that we intend on getting completed by the end of the year as well. And Brian, you know the details on those, there's...","Brian X. Tierney","I don't -- we got half of the -- we filed for 6. There are 3 more that are left to be done and we don't have significant opposition in those. So we anticipate getting those shortly after we would be able to get what we need from West Virginia.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, one's a pool agreement. The other's -- the operating agreement's in place. And then, there's an interim agreement that would be put in place as well. If you need more detail, Rich Munczinski is here, and he can describe those for you.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","No, no, that's good. But you -- right now, it looks like those should all, potentially, be done by year end?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, yes. 3 of them are already done and 3 to go in FERC and then, the corporate separation, yes. And then, you've also got the other side of the financing and everything that's going on, there's a lot of work going on associated with that activity as well.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Just a clarification from follow-up on the dividend. So you increased it another 2%. You had increase it 4% beginning of the year, the indicated rate. So that would be over 6%. But then, you're saying that this is a 4% increase for the year. I assume that's like the dividends paid?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, that's right.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","For this calendar year, up 4%?","Nicholas K. Akins","That's right.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","When we look forward to think about growth in the dividend, is it off this dividends paid in 2013 or the indicated rate? It's just a different way of looking at dividend growth than we normally look at, I think, so I'm just curious.","Brian X. Tierney","So it's just math, Steve, as you know. So what we're trying to do is, as the board adjusted their stated dividend payout ratio to that 60% to 70%, we're trying to stay in that range. And I think you'll see us grow earnings with regulated earnings over time.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just hopefully 2 quick questions. One is, I guess, I think you called it the equalizer slide, Slide 4, and you give a GAAP ROE. Is there any way of getting maybe a regulated ROE here? Because I think maybe there's some distortion where Texas may include some securitizations or I think you had -- you stated Off-System Sales in Ohio Power? And the second question is related to, I guess, the aluminum sector or primarily metal manufacturing, where Brian said some of the manufacturers are using this opportunity to retool their plants. With the retooling, do you think that makes them competitive in the current environment and we get back to a pre-recession load or where do we sell back in it?","Brian X. Tierney","So let me start with the second question first, Anthony. So for instance, some of the things that we've seen some people do, in terms of retooling, we have one customer who's taking down 3 boilers that they had and are replacing it with a more -- a single, more efficient boiler. So in that case, they're becoming more efficient and we don't expect the load to come back to the pre-recession load. In other instances, people are saying, \"Hey, prices aren't high enough here for us to continue operating at the levels that we were. We're going to take the plant down. We're going to do preventive maintenance and get the plant back online at a time when aluminum prices recover.\" So it's really a combination of both of those things. Some of it is efficiency and the load will be reduced when it comes back, and others just taking opportunistic outages.","Nicholas K. Akins","The interesting thing is -- we're seeing is for the customers that obviously are still connected to the system that haven't gone out of business, those are still the demand charges, the demand ratchet that's in place for the industrial customers has not diminished. So that's a positive in terms of -- it's sort of an indication of where they are at this point in time.","Brian X. Tierney","And the equalizer?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, the equalizer graph.","Brian X. Tierney","So yes, Anthony, we can definitely get for you the GAAP ROEs that are represented there. But you are correct. In a place like Texas, we're having the effects of the securitization. And absent that, the regulated wires return in Texas is much closer to 10%. So we can get you the detail on those for each of these, a GAAP return rather than the pro forma earned ROEs that we listed on the slide. And as Nick was saying about Ohio, if we had reflected the impact of the write-offs that we had, that 12.3% return that you see there in Ohio would be significantly lower than what we're showing there, much closer to 6%.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I guess, other than Ohio and Texas, I mean, the GAAP and regulated ROE are within the same ballpark. It's just those 2 outliers. Just because if you think about the company could keep managing costs, but one gets me where it is, \"Hey, you can't really manage cost in Ohio or AEP Texas because you're already at 12%.\" Whereas, maybe the middle ground of this slide, I guess, with the exception of Oklahoma, you could manage cost. But I guess if there's a big difference between GAAP and regulated, there is some nice opportunity there.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, you got it.","Brian X. Tierney","Those states, in particular, that you mentioned, Texas and Ohio, are outliers for the reasons that we discussed.","Operator","And we do have a question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. One, in the past, you guys had -- used to lay out for us, as it related to rate increases, how much of next year's rate increases were already in hand. So if you did the same for 2014, looking at the stuff that's already happened, how much of the planned rate increases for next year would you say are already in hand right now?","Brian X. Tierney","We'll provide you more detail on that at EEI, Ali. For this year, for what we had anticipated getting, we have most of those increases in hand at this point.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. Also...","Nicholas K. Akins","And the magnitude is smaller, too, than it used to be. I mean, it used to be huge.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. Yes. And then, on Ohio customer switching, can you remind us, at the end of the September quarter, what the switching level was?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, we're about 58% switched.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Sorry?","Nicholas K. Akins","58%, which is about in line with our targets.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the growth rate, just to be clear, not to be a little nitpicky here, but the 4% to 6%, as you mentioned a couple of times, off your original '13 guidance, the fact that your original '13 guidance has now gone up if you just focus on the midpoint, so when '13 is an actual number, presumably higher than what it was previously thought to be, would you stick to the guidance of the actual '13 number or would you keep coming back to the original guidance?","Nicholas K. Akins","We're going to keep coming back to the original guidance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the implication would be made that if '13 ends up higher, mathematically, the growth rate slightly comes lower than that. Is that the way to think about it?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, actually, it's 4% to 6% from the original 2013 guidance. And there's a bandwidth there and we'll be operating within that bandwidth.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I want to ask you about the Texas case and the write-off that we got there. Is that -- it sounded to me that you guys were hoping to have that revised somewhat in your favor. Does the write-off reflect any change in that? Or can you just elaborate a little bit on that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. We got a little bit surprised because the commission, near the end of the entire case, we had a cap put in place that was originally our estimate of the cost of construction that did not include AFUDC. And during the whole pendency of that case, there was never an indication that the cost financing rate or AFUDC would be included in that cap. And the commission, at the previous commission hearing, they indicated that AFUDC was included in that and that's where it surprised us -- surprised everyone, I think. And then they issued an order saying that it was included. And so the write-off is commensurate with the obvious recognition that if the cap is truly inclusive of that AFUDC cost, then that precipitates a write-off from our perspective. So we did that. We're going to ask -- we're going to file for a rehearing and show, I think, a pretty credible case, that it never, never was discussed. And something that, through the entire case, there is no record of our ability to respond to that kind of component being included in the cost cap. So I think it's a pretty serious issue for the Texas Commission to take up, particularly when you have a power plant that is the first of its kind. It's probably -- out of the large projects that have occurred, it's been definitely the closest to budget. It's been lower than what we anticipated from an efficiency standpoint, which enures to the benefit of customers on a fuel cost perspective. And it's won 2 power plant awards and we won the Edison Electric award for that plant as well. And so to have that kind of positive investment that's made and it's found to be prudent, and to have a substantial amount of the cost of the plant essentially be disallowed, is not a good message for those that -- who are thinking about building capacity in the state of Texas. So...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sure. I hear you on all that, and it all makes sense. But I guess what I'm wondering is, the write-off, though, doesn't reflect any benefit from reconsideration or does it?","Brian X. Tierney","It does not.","Nicholas K. Akins","No. It assumes...","Brian X. Tierney","We have an order from the commission that does not allow for the recovery of the AFUDC now, and we'll go for a rehearing. If we get a positive outcome from rehearing, then we'll adjust accordingly. But right now, we can't assume anything for...","Nicholas K. Akins","There's just no basis for that recognition.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then, for depreciation, the benefit that you guys got from that in the last couple of quarters, can you remind me what that was?","Brian X. Tierney","The benefit from?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","From lower depreciation. What's causing that? What's driving it?","Brian X. Tierney","It's the Ohio write-offs that we discussed earlier.","Okay. I think -- after this, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Brian, I want to make sure I understood your commentary about pension costs for the income statement purposes. If I interpreted it correctly, and I may have totally missed it, you're basically implying that it's a $100 million tailwind for 2014 versus what you had expected for 2013?","Brian X. Tierney","Pension cost, pension expense will be about between $70 million -- it will be about a $50 million improvement, '13 to '14.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, meaning, a reduction in the O&M expense that, that pension drives?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. Now let me be clear, that's total pension cost. That doesn't include the amount that's allocated for CapEx versus O&M.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood, completely understood. Also, I want to make sure we think about it, on the asset transfer dockets, both the Kentucky approval and the West Virginia, can you talk a little bit about the bottom line kind of what drops to the bottom line? I know you got the $44 million surcharge, but I'm just trying to think about what the cost offsets to that would be and kind of trying to do the same thing on the West Virginia side?","Brian X. Tierney","On West Virginia, we don't have an answer yet.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, but Off-System Sales, obviously, because that's not included. So that offsets some sale impact and I guess...","Brian X. Tierney","And then the capacity settlement, we get to keep as we had previously. So the capacity payments that were in rates that Kentucky used to make to Ohio Power remain in effect during the period of the freeze. So it's the plus $44 million, keep the capacity payments and you keep the upside of Off-System Sales until we go back in for the next rate case.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how much is the capacity payment in Kentucky?","Brian X. Tierney","About $20 million.","Nicholas K. Akins","$20 million.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when I think about the West Virginia request, just the request -- I know you don't have any answer. Can you give kind of similar details about the bottom line impact on kind of the items that would drop bottom line impact there?","Brian X. Tierney","It's a little complicated at this point because of the Mitchell component that is up in the air. But we would not anticipate a significant difference versus where we are today. But that will be the significant component of what the settlements are, particularly, in regards to how we handle the Mitchell assets in regard to the Wheeling merger in the APCo.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you for joining us on today's call.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","Your hosting speaker Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks Bette Jo. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today for this first quarter 2014 earnings call. AEP had a very strong quarter driven incrementally by the coldest weather in 35 years and increased market energy prices. I would say incrementally because first even with the polar vortex, as if it did not occurred and normal weather in market conditions would have prevailed, we would still have had a quarter that met our objectives of the plan we proposed you in November last year at the EEI.","And second I would maintain that the cause of the initiatives previously implemented by the company, regarding improved capital allocation to transmission in the operating companies focused on process improvement activity, such as lean in our power plants and wires business and the development of our unregulated generation business. We would not have been successful in capturing the value of the off-system sales benefits from the extreme weather and market conditions as a result of the polar vortex.","I can give you several instances that it was impaired that the cultural initiatives that have \u2013 and still the teamwork and ingenuity paid off to ensure our generation was available to the benefit of our shareholders and our customer.","Before Brian and I get into the details of the quarter, let me go over the headlines for the quarter and for the reminder of the year. AEP earnings for the first quarter both GAAP and operating came in at a $1.15 per share compared with $0.75 GAAP and $0.80 per share operating for first quarter 2013. Because of the strong results, and after review of cash flow and earnings metrics for the reminder of the year, we are increasing our 2014 guidance for 320 to 340 per share to 335 to 355 per share.","We are reaffirming guidance for 2015 and 2016 in the 4% to 6% earnings growth rate based upon the original guidance given in 2013. We will continue to monitor the fundamentals in particular, load and energy markets along with the progress of our previously announced initiatives to announce any further guidance detailed during the EEI financial conference in the fall.","Additionally, as we mentioned to you in our last earnings call, if we were to get ahead from a cash and earnings perspective we would reinvest from cash flows and retained earnings and more transmission and move projects from 2015 and 2016 into 2014 to elevate pressures that exists in those later years. Because of the excellent operations of our plants and continued focus for our employees regarding continuous improvement we are able to do just that. Consequently, AEP will invest $200 million more in the transmission projects that was identified in the green area of my second most favored graph, a transmission graph that you\u2019ve all seen previously and we will also move $60 million to $70 million of 2015, 2016 spending end of this year. There is still a lot more work to be done because we are not counting on increased load or capacity market revenues that\u2019s not the way we are running our business. I\u2019ve said before our business is now an optimization business and one in which we continually adjust the changing conditions to ensure discipline and execution, that drives consistency for our share holders and value for our customers.","Even though we now have the wins that are back somewhat because of first quarter results, our focus will not change. We will continue our capital allocation approach defined earlier, thoughtful prioritization and control of O&M expenses, continued development of our unregulated business and the continuous improvement and cultural initiatives.","The implementation of lean activities and other continuous improvement initiatives continue to produce expected results and we are pleased with the progress our employees continue to make in this regard. This effort will not slowdown because this now engrained in our decision making and how we do business and this progress will not be jeopardized because we all know that one quarter does not make a year and it certainly doesn\u2019t make three years.","On the regulatory front we have filed the PSO rate requesting $45 million of additional revenue focused on infrastructure and AMR meter investments as well as SPP related transmission charges. Interveners have filed testimony asking for varying levels of reductions and hearings are set for June and we expect an order by the end of the year.","We have filed in West Virginia and FERC to allow the transfer of half of Mitchell Plant to Wheeling power to provide needed capacity and energy to serve Wheeling customer load. Hearings are set in August in West Virginia and the FERC case commoning period ends in May. So everything is on track with the remaining Mitchell transfer. We have also filed in Virginia for the biannual rate review, while we are not asking for a rate increase because our ROEs within the statutory bandwidth, we are seeking some rate adjustments within customer classes and a requested ROE of 10.52%. Hearings for this case have been set for September.","I would also like to point out the progress that has been made with the capacity construct within PJM. The FERC has agreed with PJM on many of the capacity auction adjustments that AEP support as well to enable the recognition of the value of steel in the ground generating assets within PJMs footprint. These changes were not completely adequate, our moves in the right directions and not only enable a more balanced portfolio of resources, but also maintain the integrity and reliability of the grid particularly at times of extreme stress being such as with the polar vortex.","Just as in this side I had previously reported 89% of coal units slated for retirement in mid 2015 ran during the polar vortex that is also true for the quarter. But another interesting titbit is that these units ran at substantial 46% capacity factor during the quarter. So the need for this coal capacity was not just an abrasion, but an integral part of the maintaining comfort for our customers during the extreme cold weather.","The capacity market changes are important because this capacity construct also defines the revenues and price signals for investment as well as the bandwidth around the volatility of energy prices. Wind energy prices move as high as $1,800 megawatt an hour, this should be an indication that capacity markets are not operating properly. This is bad for investment resources, ultimately bad for the reliability of the grid and certainly bad for the customers in the end.","We are also pleased that Congress in now getting involved with hearings in the house and senate to shed some light on the confluence of pending an existing EPA rules, electricity and natural gas coordination, physical and cyber security issues related to the grid, and capacity market issues. All of which impact the resiliency of our country\u2019s electric supply to fuel the needs of our customers and the economy.","Now, after my favorite graph, which I typically call the equalizer graph on page \u2013 this is page four of the presentation. We will go through and set through some of the stage that they were looking at here. As far as overall looks like were 9.9% and that\u2019s close to the 10%, we expect that to improve. We\u2019ve got from an Ohio power perspective, I know it's showing 13.1%, but that includes some non-recurring items particularly in seed adjustments and transmission through related cost. That will bring that down to that \u2013 below that 12% allowed to return threshold with the seed test, so that\u2019s going to come down.","APCo continues to improve, we \u2013 and certainly two jurisdictions there from the Virginia standpoint were in good shape, I talked about that earlier. For West Virginia we will plan to file a rate case this year because of the returns there in that jurisdiction. We have current ROE range of 10% to 10.9% in West Virginia, but we\u2019re certainly underperforming there from an ROE perspective. So we will file a rate case there.","Kentucky is still pretty much stomaching the settlement that was done relative to the Mitchell transfer and we will fully expect to file a rate case during 2014, at the end of 2014 that would be effective by July of 2015. In the meantime there were also some sales and other benefits from the operation of Mitchell and Big Sandy will provide benefits to Kentucky. So, we expect that to continue to improve. I&M has improved markedly since the last time we discussed that it was on the order of 7% back in February of 2013 and they have made considerable progress with the addition of the current Life Cycle Management projects and is well either off-system sales revenues that occurred during the cold weather.","PSO is in the midst of a rate case as I mentioned earlier, so we expect that outcome by the end of the year. So that will be an opportunity for us as well. SWEPCo continues to have the issue of the part of the capacity of Turk that was slated for Arkansas and they continue to work on ways which to deal with that situation and other areas like transmission cost and other measures to improve the ROE there. So we expect that to come up. AEP Texas includes a securitization, so it always showing high that the 13.7%, but also has considerable customer growth, so it just staying there pretty steady.","And then AEP Transco , Holdco we continue to invest heavily in that area, so you will see the return there show up lower than what actually is the authorized and actual returns there in that part of the business. So and we intentionally will drive more investment in that area is evidenced by the $200 million I talked about earlier. So but that\u2019s a good story and we will continue to do that. So it really shows that the benefits of been able to properly allocate capital and work on the operating company side of things to ensure that we are improving from an ROE perspective. So we feel pretty good about where we said from a regulated results perspective, they are all strong and that provides the foundation for our business. So after an excellent quarter as we look at the reminder of 2014 and into 2015 and 2016 we\u2019ll be looking for following sensitivity is in our modeling in earnings to expectation.","First, the continued weather adjusted effects on load forecast in each customer category which Brian will talk about little bit later, energy prices with the peer would be increasing but not clear given the lack of long-term liquidity in the market shale gas related growth in the service territory which Brian will cover in detail, continued progress on process improvement initiatives which continue to move forward in the company in a very positive way.","Additional transmission capital allocation opportunities that may exist, rate related activities as we mentioned earlier and certainly the unregulated business from the cost side and the revenue side.","I'm reminded of an old adage that says that is better to be lucky than good, we at AEP believe there is much more desirable to be good and lucky I know you Pittsburgh Penguin fans checks blue being one of the them may not like this. But I recently attended the most recent Columbus Blue Jackets Pittsburgh Penguin playoff hockey game.","Columbus initially had trouble controlling the puck and quickly fell behind in the first period by 3 score and look like it was going to be a long night. But was focused on the fundamentals with discipline and execution scored a goal in each period we won the game in over time. In the old adage good speaks of the fundamentals and lucky speaks of a free option that cannot occur if the fundamentals were not present AEP is focusing on the fundamentals and the rest will take care of itself that\u2019s the story of the first quarter of 2014. Over to you Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick. And good morning everyone, on Slide 5 you\u2019ll see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 bisegment for the quarter. As we announced last fall at the EEI Conference we have adjusted our earnings presentation to align with our big business segments following our corporate structuring. The segment reporting detail for the first quarter of 2014 and pro forma for 2013 can be found in the supplemental information package posted on our website and in the 10-Q that we plan to file later today, the recently completed corporate separation provided the occasion for us to define segments with make our reporting simpler and more transparent. For the company overall operating earnings for the first quarter were $560 million or $1.15 per share up $0.35 per share compared to the $387 million or $0.80 per share recorded last year.","Generally the year-over-year improvement was realized across all segments and was driven by new rates that reflected our increased customer focus investment strong generation performance that captured high prices for wholesale power and high weather related retail sales. With that as an overview let me step you through the major earnings drivers bisegment on Slide 6.","Earnings for the vertically integrated segment were $0.57 per share up $0.16 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013 significant drivers include customer focus investment and our utilities that resulted in rate changes across many of our jurisdictions adding $0.08 per share for the quarter. In addition the effect of extreme weather winter temperatures improved earnings by $0.07 per share heating degree days were 25% higher in the East and 30% higher in the West when compared to last year.","Higher wholesale power prices and strong performance by our generation group bolstered off-system sales which benefited shareholders and customers the higher off-system sales improved earnings for this segment by a $0.11 per share while customers across several of our jurisdictions were realized $74 million through margin sharing mechanisms the year-over-year increase in retail and wholesale margins were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and other items.","The increase in O&M adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.03 per share due to a favorable insurance settlement recorded in 2013 and higher employee related costs, somewhat offset by lower storm expenses. The higher depreciation expense resulted from increased investment in plant reducing earnings by $0.02 per share.","Finally, other items in total were off by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher cost from PJM that we\u2019re not covered through regulatory tracking mechanisms. The transmission and distribution utility segment results were also higher than last year by $0.02 per share driven by positive rate changes and extreme weather in Texas.","The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow adding $0.02 per share for the quarter, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. From March of last year to March of this year, this segments net plant grew by nearly $1 billion an increase of 99%.","The Generation and Marketing segment had a strong quarter adding $0.15 per share to our quarterly comparison. This segment benefited from the strong performance of its generation fleet and commercial organization as well as higher wholesale power prices. I will discuss this in more detail in the next slide.","AEP river operations continue to rebound from the recent drought conditions adding $0.01 per share. Finally, corporate and other results were half a penny per share due to lower interest income at the parent. In summary, our earnings performance was strong, largely due to the affects of positive rate adjustments strong generation and commercial performance during periods of high prices and weather related improvements in retail sales.","Turning to Slide 7, let\u2019s take look at AEP generation resources. This competitive generation business was a driver behind the positive quarterly results for the Generation and Marketing segment. The extreme temperatures and energy consumption during the quarter, significantly impacted energy pricing, for the quarter, AEP GEN HUB, Day-Ahead prices for around the clock power settled to 100% higher than they did year-ago. Henry Hub natural gas prices were 45% higher.","In the phase of these extremes, our competitive generation team and the commercial organization we have built around it performed exceptionally well. Volumes for this fleet were up 22% and capacity factors were up 10%. The competitive generation fleet has about 2,500 megawatts of capacity that will retire by next summer. Approximately 1,800 megawatts of that capacity operated during the first quarter, those units experienced a capacity factor up 52%.","On the right of the slide, you will see the percentage of sales by channel. The data shows that about 69% of generation resources sales had a hedge in the first quarter and about 31% were exposed to short-term or spot pricing. This allowed the commercial and generation teams to capture higher margins, as their output was needed to meet demand during high price periods. We view our competitive retail business has a positive margin hedge for our competitive generation, this business performed well during the first quarter.","Now, turn to Slide 8, we will see our usual detail on normalized load. We are repeating the format we introduced last quarter that shows the industrial and total retail sales trends adjusted to reflect the loss of the Ormets load. On the bottom right quadrant, you can see that for the quarter weather normalized total load was up 1.5% compared to last year. Excluding Ormet, our normalized total retail sales were up 3.2%. On the bottom left of the slide, you can see that while a reported industrial sales growth was down 2.9% for the quarter, we continue to see steady improvement despite the loss of Ormet.","Excluding Ormet from the comparison, our industrial sales were 2.2% higher for the quarter, in fact eight of our top ten industrial sectors showed positive growth compared to last year. The two sectors with declining industrial sales for the quarter were Primary Metals which was influenced by the shutdown of Ormet and mining expect for oil and gas with the shale gas revolution and increasing environmental regulations adversely impacted demand for coal.","Residential sales shown in the upper left quadrant were up 4.4% for the quarter. We did see some improvement in our residential customer accounts, but most of the increase in residential sales was due to higher average usage.","Finally, in the upper right quadrant, you can see the commercial sales increased 2.9% for the quarter. We saw customer growth in the commercial class of eight tenth of a percent and higher growth in average usage. Commercial sales growth was the strongest in the western footprint, where we also saw the strongest growth in employment. While we are happy to see increased volumes in our residential and commercial classes. We have concerns that our traditional weather normalization models do not fully capture the change in consumers\u2019 behavior during extreme weather events as was the case this winter.","Now, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to describe the most recent economic activity within AEP service territory. On Slide nine, you will see that we are introducing a few new charts to give you some perspective on how the economy within AEP service territory compares to what you may have read about within U.S.","First looking at GDP for the quarter, you can see that estimated growth for AEP continues to outpace that of the U.S. at 3% and 2.7% respectively. The chart on the upper right shows that GDP in our western service area continues to outperform the U.S. and our eastern service territory. The bottom left chart displays employment growth within AEPs footprint compared to the U.S.","For the quarter employment growth for AEP service area was up 1.4% compared to 1.7% for the U.S. Growth in employment trends tend to lead growth in retail sales and that has proven true for AEP this quarter. Finally, turning to the chart on the bottom right it is clear that the job market in our western footprint is consistently stronger than the U.S. than our eastern footprint. Even though U.S. employment growth moderated somewhat in Q1 compared to Q4 of last year, we saw continued improvement in employment growth in both the eastern and western parts of our service territory over the past two quarters.","The last thing I want to discuss about load growth for the quarter is on Slide 10. As I had mentioned on previous calls, we are seeing quite a bit of growth related to shale gas activity. AEP is fortunate to have a number of major shale regions located within our service territory. The top chart illustrates the distinction that we are seeing in industrial sales growth between major shale regions as compared to non-shale regions. While we are seeing improving trends in both areas, the contrast in significant. For our shale counties excluding Ormet, industrial sales were up almost 30% in the first quarter, while industrial sales in non-shale counties were down four tenth of a percent. This is significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale rich geographies.","The bottom chart shows the industrial growth by major shale region. As you can see the most significant growth over the past two quarters has occurred in the Utica area in Ohio and the Permian Basin in Texas. We have already seen significant industrial sales growth around the Eagle Ford area in Texas, and the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia dating back to 2012. We are projecting additional new loads to be added in all five of the listed shale regions over the next several years.","Turning to Slide 11, let\u2019s review the financial health of the company. Our total debt to total capitalization is now 54.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage, and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 4.9 times and 19.9% respectively. Our qualified pension funding stands at 99% and our other post-employment benefit obligations are more than fully funded at a 122% our liquidity stands at about $3 million and it\u2019s supported by two revolving credit facilities with tenders that extend into the summers of 2016 and 2017. On January 31 Moody\u2019s upgraded AEP Inc\u2019s senior unsecured rating and the ratings of six of our operating companies. In its release announcing the upgrades Moody\u2019s cited it\u2019s more favorable view of the credit supportiveness of the U.S. regulatory environment.","Moody\u2019s also noted AEP\u2019s diversity of utility subsidiaries cash flows the company successfully executed corporate restructuring and its growing rate base. We have worked hard over the last several years to achieve the credit metrics and balance sheet demonstrated and balance sheet strength demonstrated here and is because of the strength that we\u2019re confident in funding the incremental transmission investment for this year that Nick mentioned earlier.","Finally, let me summarize the quarter and where we go from here the first quarter was very strong from an earnings standpoint operationally and by what we\u2019re able to accomplish for our customers in spite of extremely cold temperatures our generation team was able to keep our units running and our transmission and distribution employees were able to deliver energy to our customers to keep people warm and to keep businesses running.","We insulated our retail customers from much higher wholesale electricity prices due to the transition plan in Ohio we were able to deliver our Ohio standard service offer to customers savings of a $132 million relatively to PJM Day-ahead market pricing for the quarter.","In addition to our Ohio customers regulated customers of our integrated utility businesses benefited from the off-system sales margins to the tune of $74 million, an increase of $57 million over the last year\u2019s first quarter. At the EEI Conference in November and on the last earnings call we talked about how we\u2019d fill the revenue GAAP\u2019s in 2015 and 2016 as our transition in Ohio comes to an end. At that time we identified three efforts, one continuos improvement including lean initiatives, two cost shifting out of 2015 and 2016 and three, funding our transmission investments above base allocations.","In regards to the continuos improvement efforts employees have now completed lean initiatives at six of our generating plants with plants to complete an additional seven during 2014. On the distribution side of our business we have a total of 32 work districts, two of these districts have completed lean initiatives, five were on process now with an additional six more to be completed this year. In places were employees have engaged in lean practices we have identified cost savings to more efficient work practices and better utilization of the contractor workforce our transmission supply chain, procurement and corporate center organizations are engaged in similar programs demonstrating the continuos improvement and employee engagement are part of our culture.","In regards to cost shifting we have identified between $60 million and $70 million in work that we\u2019ll accelerate into 2014 from 2015 and 2016 the financial results of the first quarter give us confidence at accelerating this work will benefit our customers this year and our shareholders in future years. In our Transmission Holdco segment we had identified a base level of capital investment that was part of our budget forecast as well as a high case for incremental capital investment, the strong first quarter results give us confidence that we can fund an incremental $140 million in Transmission Holdco business and an additional $60 million in operating company transmission spend, we intend to fund this investment from operating cash flows and retain earnings and do not plan to issue incremental debt to do so. This accelerated investment means that our transmission customers, will realize enhanced reliability sooner and our shareholders will realize higher returns.","Finally, in addition to the activities mentioned about as Nick mentioned earlier, we are able to raise our earnings guidance for 2014 to a range of $3.35 per share to $3.55 per share. At this time, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2015 and 2016. As is our custom, we will likely present detailed guidance for future years, at the fall EEI Conference.","With that said, the strong first quarter of this year has enabled us to execute against our plans with confidence and to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to the operator, for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you (Operator Instructions). First question from the line of Dan Eggers, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, good morning guys.","Unidentified Company Representative","Good morning, Dan.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","A couple of your neighbors in Ohio have made announcements that they\u2019re looking next to their generation assets to a sales process. Can you just give an update on what your thought process is for your fleet and what bearing the first quarter may or may not have had on making that decision?","Nicholas K. Akins","","Yes, I think our process is unchanged, we\u2019ve said earlier that, we are going to be focusing on producing value out of that piece of the business to position that business the best we can. To try to take some of the volatility out of business and certainly to do what we can from a cost stand point within that business. And Chuck and in his team are definitely working on all of those activity.","So I\u2019d \u2013 the first quarter doesn\u2019t change our opinion of our look at that business one way or another. And I think that, as we go through the process we still have yet to see those per cursors that we talked about earlier, what happens to the capacity markets? Certainly what happens to the energy markets? What we can do with the cost structure of that business? And then how do we take the volatility of the business with not only the capacity markets, but the hedging activities that are occurring in the background relative to regulated generation. So we\u2019re still, that we\u2019re still on the same time schedule having the same discussions with our board as we go through this process and we will continue that and make decisions later on in this year and the next year.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And I guess Nick one of the ideas if you find people who would sign longer-term contracts and be interested in staying in those assets. With the first quarter volatility kind of timing market conditions, Are you having a change in tone in those conversations at this juncture?","Nicholas K. Akins","","Yes, sort of interesting there is discussion about long-term purchase power arrangements that could occur relative to this generation I think the polar vortex the sense that there is \u2013 certainly there is no when you look at the long-term markets is illiquid there is not much out there going on and sort of tends to keep those process low in the future, but we know that is the closure we get to this generation retiring, that\u2019s likely to change.","And I firmly believe there is renewed interest and what that generation looks like and how it can preserve from a long-term PPA perspective customers expectations around taking out that volatility and having some consistency. So, yes we are getting some interest in that, yet to determine what that means but it we see sustained energy process that are a bit higher than anticipated in the capacity markets we were I\u2019m sure the degree of interest will intensify as well. So again our position is not changed relative to that, we can make it look cause our regulated then it\u2019s a business that\u2019s worth taking a look at.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Great, thanks. And just one last question, can you give us an update on where coal inventories are at this point in time and under the strategy around the country you have full availability for this one.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, so we\u2019re fine on coal deliveries, we\u2019re at about 25 days on average on the system, we were 35 days going into the winner. So and keep in mind our suppliers are taken to the Mississippi and then \u2013 and then we have the Barge business to bring that coal to the plant. So we are in good shape there and most of our delivers are over the Union Pacific Railroad and their performance has been recently well rolled down as well. I think as we move into summer, that\u2019s when inventory levels start to improve, but anticipation of warmer weather over the summer, but we are in great shape.","Brian X. Tierney","Dan, we\u2019ve heard of some people doing things like burning more gas to build up their coal inventories, we went into the winter fairly healthy and we haven\u2019t had to change or dispatch our commitment at all in response to our coal levels.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Great. Thank you guys.","Nicholas K. Akins","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Chin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","Hi, good morning. On the $60 million to $70 million in cost shifting, is it fair to think about that, is that a cumulative amount of cost shifting from 2015 and 2016 into 2014?","Brian X. Tierney","What do you mean by cumulative?","Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","So, $60 million to $70 million in bringing forecast from 2015 and 2016 together, so in other words the expense levels in 2015 and 2016 prior to this announcement we should bought about is being $60 million to $70 million higher over the two years?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, it was forecasted to be spent for us in 2015 and 2016 and we\u2019ve now taken those costs and activities out of 2015 and 2016 and are now reflecting in 2014.","Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","And is that more of our front-end loaded as in more 2015 level of cost shifting or it\u2019s more backend loaded as in more 2016 and then also could you give a little bit more of a business segment breakdown of that cost shifting?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, so it\u2019s evenly spread across both years and it\u2019s across all of our business segments, so this significant component of it coming from generation and moving outages out of those years into 2014.","Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Nicholas K. Akins","Hi, Stephen. How you doing?","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I wanted to talk more about your high case growth plans and transmission, you are showing real good progress this year, could you maybe talk at a high level as to \u2013 as you think about what needs to happened to be able to achieve that growth over the next couple of years in terms of whether that be approvals or planning efforts resource, whatever it might be just how we should sort of think about the risk of execution, or what approvals, what milestones you need to hit to be able to achieve that growth.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, so we\u2019ve been very clear for probably two or three years now that and I don\u2019t know if you can recall the slide that had the base transmission and then had a green piece above that was incremental transmission that were real projects that were ready to be done, but we had to fund the capital to do it and what you see in this quarter is refocus of $200 million on that incremental green portion. So as far as risk there is very little risk associated with those projects that are already identified, rate to be done, and you can expect those returns relative to those investments to occur. So and as we look forward to the business I think we\u2019ve been a proponent order 1000 and very focused on our joint ventures as well in our Transource entity, ETT and others and they move forward pretty well as well. So we continue to look for ways to continue to improve the transmission earnings profile and that\u2019s a very distinct focus for us. But the only things we\u2019re reporting are real projects and we sort of learned our lesson awhile back about the supposition of what may happen we\u2019ve gotten over that.","Brian X. Tierney","Steven the beauty of the chart that shows the incremental transmission spend that we can make going from the base case to the high case, is that we can fund that serially as capital becomes available. So whether it\u2019s cash flows from operations, the bonus depreciation should get approved later this year. We can serially fund that incremental growth capital on a year-by-year basis and as we talked about earlier, cash flows from operations enabled us to do it this year and we\u2019ll just see how this \u2013 the end of this year and future year\u2019s play out. But since we have that growth opportunity existing within our own business, that\u2019s an awful smart place for us to put incremental capital to work.","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","That\u2019s great color, thank you. And just follow up on transmission, when you look at the competitive side of the business I\u2019m just curious if you could talk at a high level attitude the competitive dynamics there, how competitive is that, how do you access your capabilities versus others. How does that business playing out?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think we\u2019re absolutely well positioned from a competitive standpoint. Obviously that\u2019s why we\u2019ve proponent of it. But when we look at the projects that we do, the project flow, the project management structure, the engineering expertise that we have and the fact that we\u2019ve got joint ventures around portions of the country and just with the scope of our transmission system drives the benefits for our investors relative to transmission. We\u2019re well positioned in terms of the breadth and if you are plowing $1.7 billion a year in transmission projects which that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing over the next three year period each year. That\u2019s a pretty substantial critical mass around the growth of transmission. So we\u2019re not gold plating anything, we\u2019re not trying to fund projects just to do projects, these are all immediate projects in terms of refurbishment and reoptimization of the grid with retirements and generation and so forth. So a very clear path for the business case relative to transmission as far as AEP is concerned.","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Hi, good morning.","Nicholas K. Akins","Good morning, Julien.","","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","So quick follow-up there on the generation business. I\u2019d be curious, is there any tolerability in Ohio as you are thinking about it, perhaps to see some of those longer term contract against the remainder of the generation business in particular?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, sort of an interesting thing, Ohio certainly needs to take notice in my opinion of what happened during the polar vortex, and I would have to say that there is discussions going on relative to how Ohio would do with that in the future. Because it\u2019s a clear indication that we really do need to think about the portfolio for Ohio customers that has a long-term component and a short-term component to it and customers are continued to allow the switch. But keep in mind I mean we separated our generation and it is separated.","So if we would do purchase power arrangements and that kind of thing. It would have to be something to provide value to consumers on the long-term, but also value to the company as far as hedging that generation for the long-term. And I think there is a distinct opportunity for those types of discussions. It\u2019s positive for us, it\u2019s a positive for Ohio and it\u2019s certainly positive for consumers in the long run particularly industrial customers, who are looking at the polar vortex and where energy markets win, there is high degree of concern about that. So, more work to be done there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Interesting, is it about savings some of the more marginal goal assets, kind of in a more normalized environment, or is this about just again security and supply? I suppose you could kind of cut it both ways?","Brian X. Tierney","","I think it\u2019s cut both ways, when you look at jobs, taxes certainly generation within Ohio and the fact that Ohio really depended upon the capacity markets to provide long-term pricing as we knew that\u2019s not going to happen or at least not has happened thus far. So there is a degree of interest area that needs to occur relative to taking matters in their own hands from an Ohio perspective.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Interesting, and I will be curious following upon all the Utica discussion, are you seeing any nascent development on the gas project front I mean I will be curious just in terms of new gas plant entry and also broadly where gas basis is headed in your neck of the woods up there?","","Brian X. Tierney","Well, I think it\u2019s a challenge in Ohio, because certainly from a Utica standpoint, there is a great opportunity to use a resource that\u2019s indigenous within Ohio. But at the same time you got to have the fundamentals in the market and an improving economy to drive that investment and right now you have at least some glamour of hope on the economic recovery, but at the same time the market signals just aren\u2019t there. So we need to get that solidified before you see natural gas-type development.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Greg Gordon, ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Thanks, good morning guys. So, I understand you\u2019re taking the opportunity to accelerate some expenses into the year given to the phenomenal opportunities in the first quarter and the earnings result. But then also looking at the earnings guidance range, what are you assuming as a baseline that your annual sales forecast comes in as originally articulated or you assuming that you see the trend line as you saw in the first quarter?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, we have unchanged the load forecast at this point in the guidance, even in the adjusted guidance range that we\u2019ve now given, so because we are very clear that one quarter does not make a trend and certainly form a polar vertex perspective there is a continued cold weather, could that have skewed the weather normalization routines that we usually go through to adjust these numbers. And whenever we get extreme heat or extreme cold for a long period of time, you have to question that. So we\u2019re going \u2013 have to see some during this coming quarter and the third quarter a consistency around that before we make those kinds of adjustments and we\u2019re being deliberately conservative there.","Brian X. Tierney","Greg we are forecasting, we have factored in the forecast the higher wholesale prices for the balance of the year.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. As far as energy prices, that\u2019s changed.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay, so you factored in higher sort of APC wholesale prices, but you haven\u2019t assumed anymore volatility of the nature that we saw?","Nicholas K. Akins","No.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","And then you are saying that when I look at page 8, that 4.4% 1Q 2014 residential, weather normal number, you are saying you are nerves that it might not be in accurate number in your 41 to see how things trends in the second and third quarter?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, just saying we don\u2019t no to the degree at this point to really make that adjustment and, but I think it\u2019s pretty clear though that directionally it\u2019s in the right direction. It is increasing, the question is the order of magnitude and before we make that adjustment we want to be very secured in what we are seeing.","Brian X. Tierney","Greg, for the first time and some time we saw on both the residential and commercial classes significantly higher average normalized usage and more concern that the normalization models don\u2019t behave as well at describing the weather effects versus the normal effects in extreme weather, and so we\u2019d like to see another quarter before we start thinking about changing the balance of the year load forecast.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Great, thanks. Obviously, great start. Congratulations.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Brian X. Tierney","Good morning.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","The sales growth forecast, the 10-year forecast that you guys recently put out, maybe just kind of sort of lower growth over 10 years. I guess negative growth are just flattish or what how you. And I was wondering if you sort of comment on that and whether or not you think that might change with the legislation that\u2019s being purposed and just sort of how we should think about that I guess this is all Ohio, I\u2019m sorry. If you could just sort of discuss sort of a little bit about that and what you are thinking is going on there?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, so sort of a frame of reference that was used in that, if you looked at sort of comparing Apples and Oranges because one includes Ormet obviously the future anticipated it is nice. So if you exclude Ormet the energy is increasing.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, but the load forecast it sounds when I look at it seems like it\u2019s declining or just slightly flat really over the years, it doesn\u2019t look like there is really much change let say from 2016 to 2024?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, that\u2019s true, we\u2019ve been anticipating for period now that load forecasting will be relatively flat and we haven\u2019t changed that because we haven\u2019t seen the longevity of the fundamentals. I mean we\u2019re seeing initial indication in the fourth quarter of last year, I think we\u2019ve seen a broader indication this first quarter, but I think it will more capital we are going to see in another quarter to and make that determination.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, does any of this have to do with the legislation that\u2019s being, that\u2019s currently in place or might change in Ohio or could that have an impact that we should think about and if so can you give us a feeling for that?","Brian X. Tierney","No, overall the energy efficiency was pretty negligible to begin with in the overall scheme of things but as far as the legislation is concerned it\u2019s not I mean its not a significant impact at all.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","","Okay, and then just following up on Julien\u2019s question, contracting, it sounded to me that there might be some industrial interest in this. But also I wasn\u2019t clear whether or not there is any governmental interest in this. There was some comments on the part of the governor in Ohio excuse me about so second thoughts perhaps on deregulation and whether it was the best move. I was wondering if you just elaborate a little bit if there is, if there is a thought like hey you mentioned field diversity what have you but perhaps the thought that something new should change from a state policy perspective to sort of ensure that there\u2019s still diversity and all the things that nuclear and coal provide.","Brian X. Tierney","","Yes, and certainly the Governor can speak for himself. But there is certainly is recognition but its apparent by the governor and as well others including industrials that we really have to think about how to address this lack of market consistency particularly as it relates to the PJM capacity market. But we do have legislation in place, we do have competition that\u2019s there our generation is separated. So you really have to think about that in the context of how you make these adjustments. And keep in mind we in December AEP filed its ESP case with a PPA arrangement from a portion of our units that was in a partnership or OVEK units that allowed for recovery through a purchase power arrangement.","And you could see some expansion of that PPA to accommodate other generation resources within the state and that would be a way to address at least some portion of the overall requirement of Ohio customers that could be served with a long-term for formal based rate contract that could supply some of those needs. And that\u2019s something that could be done.","And I think as people become more aware of where we stand relative to retirements of coal-fired generation where we stand in terms of if we do have an economic recovery that\u2019s occurring at the same time Ohio has to really think about not only the investment potential for new generation but also the maintenance of existing generation and that\u2019s what the key component of these discussion within tale.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","","Do you think there will be any need for change in regulatory or legislation or I mean with that entail any of that or is there something that could be done under current constructors that you see.","Brian X. Tierney","","No, we see it as something that could be done under the current constructors evidenced by our PPA arrangement that we filed in our ESP filing late last year we believe that would be done and customers could continue to choose although and all likely have the long-term PPA\u2019s would be non-bypassable charge or something like that they would benefit Ohio in total, but and at the same time allow customers to continue to shop and choose suppliers.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, really appreciated.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning guys. And just quick question on the I think in the annual guidance you had laid out I think $175 million for rate relief is the target I just conform, is that 65 that you had in the first quarter is that one on an apples-to-apple basis, sort of 65 to 175 of the bag. Is that the right way to think about it?","Brian X. Tierney","","Well, it\u2019s on an annualize basis the 175, so it\u2019s for the full year of 2014. So, we\u2019re of the 175 that we\u2019ve previously identified we are right on track to get all of that.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, that I know you are on track to get exceeded that?","Brian X. Tierney","No.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That\u2019s still the number. Okay.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, we are right on it.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. And one other thing, I was just curious that you look at the portfolio, and how it performed in the first quarter. You obviously had some of the sales commitments and then the access to sell spot. If you kind of imagine a world where you hadn\u2019t had the plants that you are going to be shutting, would you still have been that long and would you been kind of more in places showed and how is the portfolio kind of evolving to address that?","Brian X. Tierney","","Well, it\u2019s two things. One is that there clearly would have been less volume, right there was a 52% capacity factor on the 1800 megawatts, but for the whole country sake and there would be less volume and likely higher prices. So we don\u2019t know what the net effect of that would be \u2013 would we\u2019ve had more hours that $1800 megawatt hour.","Nicholas K. Akins","And keep in mind that from the generation perspective we no longer have the obligation to serve in Ohio. So it really is about an optimization business is oppose to ever increasing demand and having to serve them. So that really drives the whole different business model relative to that and then from the overall market context as Brian said certainly there is implications and shortage of capacity and I think people are realizing that.","Brian X. Tierney","To answer your question directly Jonathan as well we would still be net long.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, I\u2019m thinking the 1800 megawatts to 52% CapEx, it probably wouldn\u2019t have been the whole of that 31%?","Nicholas K. Akins","That\u2019s correct.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay, thank you very much.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc. Please go head.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, Paul. We can hear you.","","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just wanted to clarify that this $200 million transmission is not an acceleration, it\u2019s actually incremental that you found because you have this capital head room?","Nicholas K. Akins","That\u2019s right, it\u2019s incremental.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And I didn\u2019t see any discussion of Ohio shopping. Is that a big impact or have we kind of lapped out at this point?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, we\u2019re in the upper 60% right now in terms of switching; we anticipate that by the end of the year we\u2019d be about 71% switched.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, and then any comments about your expectations about the upcoming auction?","Nicholas K. Akins","Are we talking about the PJM capacity auction or\u2026","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes, yes sorry, sorry PJM.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, our expectation is that the capacity prices will go probably in that $80 to $100 per megawatt day range, but who knows I mean because the way this capacity construct works, where things happen all the time. And as long as we get some of these adjustments from a FERC perspective that certainly will be helpful. But again it\u2019s one of those things that, and it goes back to the earlier discussion of how we view this business. If you can\u2019t really that market construct and PJM it\u2019s very difficult to really map out what the revenues are going to be from a capacity standpoint. So hopefully, it will be certainly something that is more adequate, certainly for the continued operations of base load generation like coal and nuclear.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins","Good morning, Steve.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","","Hi, first clarification to 25 day coal piles you have now. What would that be versus like a normal or year-ago?","Nicholas K. Akins","","Last year I think we were still at the 30, 35 day range, I think it was 35 we move from 45 to 35, but it\u2019s not unusual we\u2019ve had inventory levels in the past as low as 10 day. So it\u2019s not anything that, that we have to do any corrective action around.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Second question is on I think you mentioned at these PJM uplift charges was a bit of a drag in the quarter? Did you \u2013 were you able to pass those through it all or you have to kind of absorb those?","Nicholas K. Akins","So the once that identified that made up, most of that $0.05 per share difference for the vertically integrated we\u2019re in the jurisdictions where we couldn\u2019t pass them through. In some of our jurisdictions we are allowed to pass them through on trackers.","Brian X. Tierney","You can pass them through on trackers you have the opportunity to recover them","","Nicholas K. Akins","In future periods.","","Brian X. Tierney","In future periods.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And did you defer then the cost of those, or you could do that.","Brian X. Tierney","","We were not able to defer those.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And you are going to see coal recovery like first energy as in some of these on your retail contracts can you do that?","Nicholas K. Akins","","Yes, so these are different items that we are talking about, one was for the vertically integrated utilities. And then there is the issue of passing through to customers on our competitive retail side. We\u2019ve made a corporate decision that we\u2019re not going to pass those through associated with the first quarter of this year. We have a misstep in some customers started to see those charges pass through, we have gone back and since corrected that and for this quarter we are not passing those incremental charges through to our competitive retail customers.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One last question, we are going to get the EPA green house gas rule soon for existing and just made curious what you\u2019re expecting there and how you are thinking about potential implications?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, if you hear what\u2019s being said, certainly Gena McCarthy has been public about certainly they don\u2019t have any \u2013 at least they are not focused on anything relative to reducing the reliability of the grid. I think that\u2019s clearly within question now and she has reinforced the point that they are not trying to take coal away that there are not \u2013 they are concerned about the reliability of the grid and won\u2019t do anything to unpair that. So there is somewhat of an expectation that they may go outside the fence and focus on energy efficiency on those types of things with the state, and give the states which I said they would give the state a lot of opportunity to be able to come up with their mechanisms to adjust to the new targets. So it\u2019s going to be I mean in my opinion it\u2019s going to wind up being a state process that we go through, and one that at least dispose to provide a significant amount of flexibility and how we respond and certainly with Hazmat went further then anyone anticipated in terms of retirement generation, and in fact AEP is already 21% lower than 2005 levels and the present targets worth 17% by 2020. So the industry is already come along way and the particular AEP has, so I think as long as they give that geographic and state flexibility we should have an opportunity to respond in very incredible fashion.","Unidentified Analyst","","Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins","","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","Okay. Next question is from the line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Hey, guys congrats on a great quarter and thank you for taking my call.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks, Michael.","","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I just want to look at Slide 4 where you show the earned ROEs by jurisdiction. And I want to compare it to the same slide from the first quarter of 2013\u2019s earnings call. Because if I do that, except for Ohio Power in Texas, pretty much everything else is down year-over-year rolling 12 months. How much of those decreases do you attribute to weather versus other factors?","Nicholas K. Akins","","Yes, I don\u2019t see much of it in terms of weather. I think the ones that are down have investments that are occurring like there is \u2013 there is a transfers that occurred to APCo and to Kentucky that takes a while to stabilize after you make these certain I mean settlement deals that are done and then you come in for rate cases for recovery for Mitchell and Kentucky and so forth. And then of course Turk being just built in SWEPCO, so and then the transmission the heavy investment cycle it\u2019s going on there. So I think it\u2019s really more reflection of the timing of the investments cycle and similarly we worked long and hard on putting writers in place to bring the revenue more concurrent, but on these large capital investments we continue to work due to rate process. And Indiana has been very positive because certainly the I&M team has been very successful in putting legislation in place that essentially allows that recovery more quickly for things like the nuclear Life Cycle Management. So I would not read that as we have a continued deterioration of ROEs. I would it as more where we are at in the investment cycle.","","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And just when you think about 2014 and 2015, what efforts, so kind of specific, whether it\u2019s specific jurisdiction or specific state, do you anticipate trying to get done that makes a structural change to reduce lag?","Nicholas K. Akins","Certainly, Kentucky. I mean getting the Mitchell assets reflected in Kentucky\u2019s base rate is a big component of that. And that\u2019s what a lot of the drag on Kentucky\u2019s ROE is it \u2013 it\u2019s equity component is increased so much and to transfer those Mitchell assets over there.","Brian X. Tierney","And APCo and West Virginia, and certainly that ROE has been low for a long period of time and its while Virginia has stabilized in a very good place, West Virginia we still need to work that\u2019s why we are making the filing this year. So those initiatives will be in place to do and then as far as SWEPCO is concerned. We continue to look for home relative to the investment the 88 megawatts of Turk station and Arkansas should be looking at that at some point hopefully, because they see the value of those assets. And then overall load growth and some reductions and some of the capacity that PPA contracts that flow to SWEPCO have ended. So there is an opportunity for the use of that additional capacity and energy with in the SWEPCO portfolio. So and there is issues in regard to that as well.","So you could bet that any of these that appear low at this point there is a whole litany of actions being taken in the background to bring those backup to acceptable levels.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2019 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome to the call, your first time in the call. I'm willing Bette Jo Rozsa is still listening even though she is in retirement, but thanks for everyone for joining AEP's third quarter earnings call. Brian will update you on the financials for the quarter and year-to-date a little later, but I'll summarize my view of the quarter as we go forward.","First, we had a great quarter, supported by warm weather through September, previous positive regulatory outcomes that are now being reflected in our financial results, continued success in management or O&M expenses. And I have to say, load is making a comeback. After the lower load last quarter, it is good to see some improvement that generally remains flat to last year, but still positive from the second quarter. We're watching this trend closely during the fourth quarter and into next year.","Given all of that, we are raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance range for 2019 from $4 to $4.20 per share to $4.14 to $4.24 per share with a new midpoint of $4.19 per share. We're also reaffirming our 5% to 7% growth rate based upon our original guidance. Additionally, the AEP Board earlier this week authorized an increase of $0.03 per share from $0.67 to $0.70 a share, a 4.5% increase. This increase keeps us firmly in the middle of our targeted 60% to 70% payout range. And along with last year's increase of 8.1% averages to a 6.3% increase for the last two years, commensurate with our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. We continue to expect the dividend to grow in line with our earnings and firmly within our targeted payout ratio.","So let's step into a few highlight areas for the quarter. Regarding our North Central Wind projects, as you recall we had made filings for state approvals in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas on July 15 and during the third quarter, we requested FERC approval of this transaction as well. Also we would acquired three wind farms currently under development by Invenergy within service dates in 2020 and 2021 based upon requirements consistent with the integrated resource plans of both PSO and SWEPCO in the various jurisdictions. Finalized procedural schedules have been determined in all of the state jurisdictions at this point. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has set the PSO schedule for hearings in January of 2020.","Louisiana Public Service Commission, SWEPCO Louisiana hearings for March 2020, the Arkansas Public Service Commission has also set its scheduled for March 2020, and the Public Utility Commission of Texas has set the schedule for hearings in February of 2020. So we're currently working with the discovery process in each jurisdiction, and we're on track to receive final decisions by the summer of 2020. I'll remind everyone once again that these projects are not in our capital plan.","Regarding regulated solar, HB 6 has cleared the path for credits to be applied to our existing solar request before the Ohio Commission. With this change, we have followed a temporary delay to provide additional clarity concerning project benefits to our customers, and we await a decision from the PUCO. While on the subject of Ohio, we are continuing our focus on HB 247 with hearings progressing well. This bill is important in regards to further grid modernization, technology deployment and behind-the-meter customer investment opportunities to improve the customer experience.","There is no doubt our business is changing at the distribution level in regards to technology, grid modernization, distributed generation and further grid and customer rate optimization efficiency opportunities. HB 247 modifies Ohio's electric retail service to allow the company to include these provisions in electric security plans filed with the PUCO. This allows us to provide that continued obligation for our customers to improve the customer experience and be able to provide universal access to the benefits of the clean energy economy.","Our contracted renewables, which have benefited from the recently acquired wind facilities, development opportunities and resources, continues to perform well. The projects are performing toward the upper end of acquisition assumptions and the development portfolio is making good progress as well. We have one project that we expect to place in service in 2020 using all the PTC safe harbor equipment and expect to release an announcement of a project, backed by long-term contract with an investment grade counterparty by the end of the year and there are others in the pipeline that look really good as well.","Our Regulated Utilities continue to perform very well. I just want to take a moment to congratulate our employees at the Cook Nuclear Plant that once again received an Info Excellence Rating. We are very pleased with that outcome and this exemplifies our belief that operational excellence is the foundation for anything else that AEP wishes to achieve from a strategic perspective. We're in the midst of four major rate cases that I'll update you on.","In Arkansas, we followed a settlement of that case and includes all the parties that contains a net $18 million increase or 9.45% ROE with a formula base rate process for five years, because we have not filed the rate case in Arkansas on approximately 10 years. It's important to note this order included no disallowances on the $1.2 billion of investments made on generation and environmental retrofits. The company requested a $34 million net increase. So, all in all a decent settlement to move forward with a new form of base rate mechanism. The settlement of rates Arkansas Public Service Commission approval with rates assumed to go in effect in January 2020.","In Indiana, we filed a case in May of 2019 for a net increase of $94 million and 10.5% ROE with a 2020 forecasted test year. The rate case includes our Innovate Indiana program that supports the continued operation of Cook nuclear plant, new smart grid technologies, AMI meters, expansion of electric vehicle charging and support for renewable energy.","Testimony by I&M and intervenors have already been filed and Indiana staff does not file testimony. We filed with testimony in September and hearings are currently ongoing. We expect an order on rates to go in effect by March 2020. In Michigan, I&M filed a base rate case in June requesting a net increase of $52 million and a 10.5% ROE with also a 2020 forecasted test year.","The Michigan plant also includes support for the continued operation of Cook nuclear plant, and our commitment to distribution reliability through equipment upgrades tree trimming and AMI meters. Staff and intervenor testimony has been filed with staff recommending a 9.75% ROE with a $38 million revenue increase. We'll follow a vital testimony in November with hearings also being in November and expect the commission order in April of 2020.","And lastly, regarding the AEP Texas rate case, we filed in May a base rate case review that included a net increase of $35 million and a requested ROE of 10.5% with a 2018 test year. The rate request includes increased charges to retail electric provider's reps for use of AEP, Texas D&D lines, along with refunds and credits associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.","The PUC staff August and all this testimony with reductions in both the transmission and distribution revenue requirements based upon a 9.35% ROE removing various incentive and expenses incremental distribution forestry expenses and other tax and depreciation related adjustments.","The hearings concluded in August. The case has been fully briefed and we AEP from the ALJs in mid-November. We will then follow exceptions and expect a ruling from the commission in the first quarter of 2020. Summaries of all of these cases are included in the earnings slide presentation.","Now moving to the economy. This quarter has indicated some bright spots to consider. Many have talked about this economy being driven forward by the consumer, because of low unemployment and higher wages. We are seeing that as well in our service territory. While industrial overall is still down, but improved from last quarter residential and commercial are both more than expected. We have the lowest unemployment on record in our territory going back to 1,990 and wages are growing faster than inflation.","And even in the industrial sectors, which have improved overall from last quarter. The oil and gas sector growth was the strongest we've seen since 2016. As you know our margins are higher on residential and commercial and industrial. So overall financial results are positive. So all-in-all I would say it's time for a return of optimism regarding the economy.","So, now moving to the equalizer graph. The overall regulated operations ROE is currently 10.1%. It was 9.7% last quarter. We generally project the ROE for our regulated segments to be combined to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. We have a long track record of delivering these results and we expect that to continue. The reason for the increase in third quarter 2019 versus second quarter includes the effect of favorable weather this September.","I'll also not bore you the size above for you the size of in the chart. It's interesting to note that AEP Transmission Holdco is now the second largest operating utility behind Appalachian power. So that's interesting to note and you have several of them to approximately the same size companies as well that follow on to that. So we're continuing to make quite a bit of progress. And it is interesting to note.","Moving on to the sale on AEP, Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the third quarter was 11.3% and we expect to end 2019, 11% as the legacy fuel and capacity charges the poor and the RSR as they recalled roll off and we continue to invest in the distribution of smart grid.","APCo the ROE for APCo at the end of third quarter 2019 was 9%. APCo's change in ROE from second quarter 2019 is primarily due to favorable weather and rate proceedings when comparing third quarter 2019 with third quarter 2018, partially offset by lower normalized usage in third quarter 2019 versus third quarter 2018.","West Virginia. As you recall the West Virginia new base rates in March 2019 which was a $44 million base rate increase based on 9.75% ROE. Virginia's first review is in 2020 and we'll cover the 2017 to 2019 periods and ROE of 9.42% will be used for tri-annual period review was 70 basis points bandwidth ranging from 8.72% to 10.12. So that will be coming up.","As far as Kentucky Power is concerned, the ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of the third quarter was 7.8%. Kentucky's change in ROE from second quarter is primarily due to slightly favorable normalized usage weather and transmission revenues. We're working on optimizing revenue and scrutinizing the OEM and capital to improve ROE by the end of the year.","With I&M, I&M at the end of the third quarter was 11.6%. I&M's positive performance through the third quarter of 2019 is primarily driven by timing of expenses, favorable financing of long-term debt, supportive regulatory environments and some onetime adjustments.","I&M expects to end the year with an ROE around 10.5% which is higher than authorized ROEs in Indiana and Michigan primarily due to onetime adjustments. I&M continues to successfully execute, its capital programs in generation, transmission and distribution and recently followed future test year rate cases in Indiana and Michigan to only recover your ongoing capital costs.","Regarding PSO, PSO ended the quarter with an ROE at 11.3%. PSO's increase in ROE was due primarily to summer weather and normalized usage. PSO received an order in our case settlement in March 2019, as you recall approving a $46 million increase and a 9.4% ROE. So we've seen a great turnaround in Oklahoma. And in fact Oklahoma is a broad spot from the economic process as well. Oklahoma continues to operate on all cylinders and continue to increase in terms of load.","SWEPCO. SWEPCO the end of third quarter 2019 was 6.7%. The most recent 12-month ROE increased primarily due to favorable weather and favorable normalized load. We did as I mentioned follow the Arkansas base rate case and the settlements that are pending there and an ROE of 9.45% and cash structure of 52.1% debt and 47.9% equity.","SWEPCO's ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the Stuart plant that is not in retail rates. As far as Texas is concerned, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the third quarter was 8.8%. The main driver for the increase in ROE is primarily due to favorable summer weather. We expect the ROE to decline by year-end due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings and the base rate review filed with the PUCT in May.","Favorable regulatory treatment has allowed us to file annual DCRF and bi-annual filings and recover our costs on distribution and transmission related capital investments. But during a rate review year there is a lag associated with these filings. In addition continued high levels of investment and timing of our planned comprehensive rate review will continue to have the impact on ROE and AEP Texas in 2019.","And then the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at the end of the third quarter was 11.4%. AEP's transmission Holdco, ROE was higher than second quarter 2019 driven by the prior year radial impact adjustment falling off and higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues in third quarter. Transmission is forecasting a higher ROE than authorized at the end of fiscal 2019 as a result of higher revenues and a prior year favorable true up.","So as we as we look forward to EEI, you can expect AEP to give further updates regarding continued affirmation of our 5% to 7% growth rate, details of capital plans, additional focus on OEM-related initiatives and any further updates on renewables, rate cases and other matters.","There's no question AEP continues to fire in all cylinders as we continue our promise of being a premium regulated utility with the consistency and quality of earnings and dividends that our shareholders expect. We reiterate our intention of achieving the higher end of our 5% to 7% growth rate. We'd be disappointed not to achieve it. We believe the foundation is there to achieve just that.","As the Duty Brothers one of the latest nominees and it's about time they were an nominee for the Rock Hall of fame this year, said we got to let the music play what the people need is a way to make them small. Well that's what we want for our investors and we intend on letting a great AEP team play, so listen to the music. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Thank you Nick and good morning everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some update on more than the economy review our balance sheet and liquidity and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI Conference.","Let's talk briefly on Slide 6 which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.49 per share compared to $1.17 per share in 2018. GAAP earnings through September were $3.58 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2008. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the release.","Let's get into the detail on Slide 7 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.46 per share or $722 million compared to $1.26 per share or $619 million in 2018. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.89 per share up $0.18 primarily driven by rate changes which were favorable by $0.07. Weather was also favorable this quarter up $0.04 from last year. Smaller impacts for this segment are listed on the slide.","The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.27 per share down $0.03 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined due to the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio and higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. These items were partially offset by recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT, weather and rate changes.","The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.25 per share, an improvement of $0.10 over last year. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base as well as the impact of a non-recurring prior year accounting adjustment.","Net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 18% since September of last year. Generation & Marketing earned $0.16 per share up $0.08 from last year primarily driven by favorable taxes that will levelize over the year. This segment reflects the growth in the renewables business and favorable wholesale margins.","Corporate and Other was down $0.13 primarily due to tax items that will levelize over the year as well as higher O&M and interest expense.","Let's turn to slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.65 per share or $1.8 billion compared to $3.23 per share or $1.6 billion in 2018.","Looking at the earnings drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.9 per share up $0.16 with rate changes being the largest driver in the segment. Other positive items included lower O&M and taxes as well as higher AFUDC. While weather was favorable compared to normal, it was unfavorable compared to last year subtracting $0.12.","Normalized load was also down for the year and depreciation increased due to incremental investment. Through September, the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.85 per share up $0.07 from last year influenced by the reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio.","Other favorable drivers included higher rate relief and ERCOT transmission revenue as well as favorable carrying charges in Texas, partially offsetting these favorable items with the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, unfavorable weather, higher depreciation property taxes and O&M.","The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.82 per share up $0.25 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected a return on incremental rate base, a favorable annual true-up in FERC settlement, higher AFUDC and the non-recurring prior year accounting adjustments.","Generation & Marketing produced $0.30 per share. The renewables business grew with the repowering of Trent Mesa and Desert Sky as well as the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. Increases in retail and wholesale margins were partially offset by lower generation sales due to lower energy prices, plant retirements and outages.","Finally, Corporate and Other were down $0.15 driven by higher tax expense primarily from consolidating tax items that will reverse by year-end with a tenure relating to prior period tax adjustments. Interest expense was also higher.","Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in raising and narrowing our annual operating earnings guidance to $4.14 per share to $4.24.","Now let's turn to slide 9 to provide an update on our system load. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retails sales were essentially flat for the quarter compared to 2018. This represents a marked improvement from our last quarterly update.","Third quarter sales are up at the Transmission & Distribution Utilities and public service company in Oklahoma while the remaining Vertically Integrated Utilities experienced the decline. For the year-to-date comparison, AEP's normalized retail sales were down six-tenths of a percent from last year.","Through September, the growth in residential sales has being offset by decline in commercial and industrial sales. You will notice that our latest year end estimate is projecting normalized retail sales we'll finish the year down five-tenths of a percent from 2018. The mix of sales -- of sales growth combined with rate design nuances give us confidence in our 2019 guidance in light of our load outlook. I'll cover rate design later in the presentation.","Moving to the upper left chart. Normalized residential sales increased by seven-tenths of a percent for the quarter. Customer count growth was responsible for three-tenths of a percent increase while the remaining four-tenths was due to improvement in normalized usage.","Third quarter residential sales were up at several of our operating companies with the exceptions of Appalachian Power, I&M and SWEPCO. Year-to-date normalized residential sales increased by two-tenths of a percent, which was mostly driven by an increase in residential customer count.","The uptick in residential sales this year is consistent with macroeconomic drivers. Unemployment rates across the AEP service territory are at record lows. Tight labor market has created upward pressure on the wages. This has allowed personnel income to grow faster than inflation through most of 2019. As incomes rise, customers tend to purchase more electricity and consuming products.","Moving to the upper right chart. Normalized commercial sales increased by four-tenths of a percent for the quarter. The results varied by operating company but were strongest in the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment. Seven of our top 10 commercial sectors posted growth this quarter with the strongest growth coming from the utilities, hospitals and accommodation sectors. Through September, normalized commercial sales were down seven-tenths of a percent from last year.","Not surprising the sector that posted the biggest draft in commercial sales was traditional retail. As you can see on this chart there has been a consistent improvement over the last 12 months in commercial sales growth.","Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 1.1% for the quarter, which brought the year-to-date comparison to 1.4% below last year. For both periods industrial sales were down at most operating companies with the exception of PSO which has experienced double-digit growth from oil and gas activity. We are fortunate to have these sectors in our industrial mix. The impact of the General Motors strike on our load was negligible.","Turning to Slide 10, I'll provide a brief update with respect to industrial sales growth by sector. This chart shows the distinction growth between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. Industrial sales to oil and gas industries increased by 7.8%, which was the strongest growth in these sectors since the first quarter of 2016.","This was largely driven by the 16.3% growth in the pipeline and transportation sector. Most of the growth in the quarter was a result of a number of anticipated expansions that will address congestion issues coming out of the major shale regions in our service territory. There are still additional oil and gas related expansions in the development pipeline that will provide more growth over the next 18 months.","Focusing your attention on the green bars, the non-oil and gas industrials were down for the quarter but lesser than last quarter. For the AEP system, chemicals manufacturing and transportation equipment manufacturing accounted for most of this impact.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 2.4% for the quarter, which is 0.3% above the U.S. The strongest growth for the quarter came from our Oklahoma service territory. All of our service territories experienced GDP growth for the quarter.","Moving to the right chart, you see an employment growth for the AEP service territory improved this quarter to 0.8% above last year while U.S. growth moderated slightly in the third quarter. Throughout the AEP footprint, nearly 16000 jobs were added in the third quarter with 42% of those coming from the education and health care sector.","Turning to Slide 12. I want to point a nuance related to customer class rate design. Some 72% of industrial rates across our system are fixed rather than variable, a 1% decline in industrial load is much less impactful than a 1% decline in residential load, where 82% of the rate is variable. For your reference, a 1% change in industrial sales is worth about $0.02 per share.","Now let's move on to Slide 13 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio improved slightly during the quarter to 58.7%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the BAA1 range at 15.2% and our net liquidity stood at about $2.6 billion supported by our revolving credit facility.","Our qualified pension funding decreased approximately 2% to 94%, a drop in interest rates increased the pension liability here. OPEB funding decreased approximately 7% to 123%. This was a result of lower interest rates and a new OPEB liability experience study both of which increased the OPEB liability.","Let's try and wrap this up on Slide 14 and get to your questions. The strong results we delivered year-to-date and our confidence in our plan for the remainder of the year allow us to raise and narrow the operating earnings guidance range to $4.14 per share to $4.24.","Our message at EEI will be that we are the premium regulated utility, delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth with dividends growing in line with earnings. Our plan has line of sight transparency to growth and has greatly reduced execution risk. We will provide detailed drivers for 2020 earnings by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans.","One final item. We have historically released fourth quarter and full year earnings in January of the subsequent year. In 2020, we released 2019 full year and fourth quarter earnings in late February, more coincident with the following of the 2019 10-K. We look forward to seeing many of you in Orlando in a couple of weeks.","And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first in the line Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning.","Nick Akins","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, perhaps if I can go back to some of the commentaries on the last call and brief, certainly some variations across the service territory on your sales trends would be curious, how does this position you relative to your broad plans and thought process against the 5% to 7%? Just want to be exceptionally clear, as you think about having closed some good results here in the third quarter and again reaffirming the higher end?","Nick Akins","Yes, there is no change in our thought process. We're still tracking 5% to 7%. We disappointed if we weren't in the upper range of that, because obviously, when you look at the components of load here from a financial perspective, it's not having much impact on our plans. And though by the way, we adjust all the time, for weather, for all kinds of things. And we have a big opportunity to do that.","And I think there's a real opportunity for us to continue to advance, particularly with the renewables play and everything else that's going on. So, even without that though, I think we're in great shape. So it hasn't changed anything. I mean, probably last quarter we probably talked almost too much about the loans and the industrial side of things. And really there's nothing compared to what we experienced back in 2009 and that did pretty well weather in that storm.","So -- but in this case, I think you\u2019re seeing some resiliency there from an industrial and manufacturing standpoint and you\u2019re seeing it start to pick up. And from the -- and as we said, it's also interesting to note, it's great to have diversity in load, because we've got the oil and gas activity that's going gangbusters with the transportation sector.","And then also you think of what's going on just the consumer side and everyone's talking about this being a consumer-driven economy. And there's no question that people have more money in their pockets and more people have jobs. And you're seeing that reflected in the numbers that we see. So we stand committed to what we've always said before, and we fully expect to be in the upper range of that 5% to 7%.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thanks for the clarity there. And then perhaps if I can jump in real quickly. How are you trending on energy supply as you think about the -- and you said, you might be updating this with respect to EEI, but can you elaborate at least initially on how you're trending on the energy supply side of the business? Obviously, there's a number of different moving factors within that segment of the business renewables increasing sort of legacy stuff declining still. How is that trending all together? If you can give us a little bit of a sense here, especially again relative to that longer-term 5% to 7%.","Nick Akins ","Yes. It's going to be up versus what we talked about last year at EEI. But the fact of the matter is, as we've sold off some of the competitive generation of the retiring plants, we're replacing some of those earnings with the renewable business that we had. So it's not declining the way you might expect from the sale of the competitive assets and the retirements, but we\u2019ve filled in some of that gap with the renewables, but we don't expect that to be a huge growing business for us going forward.","Brian Tierney","And by the way on the contract -- contracted renewables, we continue to do very well in that business. Obviously, it's measured with a $2.2 billion of capital that we've allocated to it. The organization there is doing a wonderful job of being judicious about that. Obviously, the acquisition that we made was very positive, but the development opportunities are significant there. And we have some other opportunities that we continue to work on.","So that pipeline can continue as long as we wanted to continue. And to what extent we want to continue. But we're able to make that kind of decision regarding that business, because we also have a huge transmission business and a growing distribution business is huge already, but there's all kinds of opportunities there. So really our big issue is continuing to manage around a strong and robust balance sheet continuing to deploy the capital.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. I'll leave it there. See you guys soon. Cheers.","Brian Tierney","Thanks.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins ","Good morning Steve.","Steve Fleishman ","Hey, good morning. I\u2019m just the first curious question on the growth at the PSO particularly on energy because from an energy standpoint you would have thought that's been the area where the rig count has gone down the most. So is there a way to kind of make sense of that?","Nick Akins","Well, there has been some industrials that have in place down there and some expansions. And so Oklahoma has a governor down there that is really focused on economic development and I think it's having an impact on the state.","We're very happy to see that. There's certainly low rates there, and the ability to put these industrials in place, but it's probably a more balanced economy as well. Steve, even what you're seeing with rig count. A lot of the growth that we've seen has been a mid and downstream. And a lot of that specifically in pipeline transportation un-congesting a lot of the shale region congestion that's happened over the last several years and it's moving the products and commodities out of those regions.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And just -- I think you kind of answered this, but just the renewables acquisition that you made. Can you just give us kind of a flavor of how well that's gone versus pro forma? And just how much are you seeing the ability to potentially expand.","Nick Akins","Yeah, I think we're non-utility renewables. Yeah, so we're particularly pleased with the performance of that particular acquisition and really in concert with the other development opportunities that we were focused on. But when you think about the acquisition of not only the projects and really the economics was based on the active projects that were ongoing the developmental opportunities we\u2019ve hardly placed any value on, because you didn't know they would happen. But in fact those have continued to progress quite nicely.","So it really has been an opportunity for us to continue the expansion of that effort. And then you also have to include Santa Rita in that where we\u2019ve continue to expand from that perspective. So I think that business is moving along quite well. We're very disciplined in the way we approach it and I think it's paid off.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning, guys. My first question is just on forward-looking guidance. I guess, one, it sounds like you would not put out a 2021 range at EEI for EPS? And then, two, related to that, can you remind us of the current drivers underlying your 2020 range?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, we're likely just to focus on 2020. At EEI we reaffirmed our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Remember that our guidance for 2020 is $4.25 to $4.45 and we're likely to say that that's what it will be again for 2020. And the key drivers are the things that you would think about for a traditional premium regulated utility.","It's rate outcomes, ability to invest in our organic regulated businesses, our ability to continue to invest in contracted renewables, and then, of course, things like weather and load will impact the earnings outlook as well. So not to forget, of course, our ability to constrain as we have over many years O&M spending and we're particularly going to be focused on that in 2020.","Brian Tierney","You're going to hear more about now achieving excellence program that really is focused on a forward view of where our business needs to go. And our employees are all energized around it, because we have to redefine ourselves going forward.","And the outcome of that, obviously, is to be able to deploy more capital, but also to reduce O&M, because you're able to deploy capital and be able to optimize and drive efficiencies through automation digitization and all those kinds of things.","And so, for us it's really a focus on changing that business. And the fact that we're coming out with our guidance for 2020 and then the 5% to 7% growth rate, I think, we're comfortable with just doing that because that element of consistency is there and we don't expect it to change. I mean you can sort of do your own math.","And typically what we've done is, when we go down over the year we just did the math for you. So just think of it from that perspective. Now the one thing that could change that is the regulated renewables that are not included in the capital plan. So you could have a step change and then continue at 5% to 7%. So that's the kind of thing that we're looking at right now.","Nick Akins","A positive step change.","Brian Tierney","Yes, positive step change.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. That's good to hear. So it sounds like some of the positive things over the past year that have changed underlying 2020 are potentially curtailed a little bit, maybe by load or other factors. But, net-net, you're pretty much come back to the same place?","Nick Akins","No. We're not saying anything back in 2020, because obviously our transmission business continues to do well and other components of our business as well. And then the load itself. There's components of that load that\u2019s doing really well.","And from a financial perspective, load will have not that much of an impact on the earnings of the company. So we're not saying that at all. I mean 2020, it's full speed ahead. And then 2021, we'll obviously see the outcome of the regulated renewable piece of it and go from there.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. Excellent. And then, just given one of your peers in Texas and some of the back and forth in their rate case proceeding, can you give us an update on kind of the latest in the rate case process and dialogue and any thoughts to the overall Texas environment changing?","Nick Akins","Well, certainly, Texas is Texas. I mean, there's all kinds of opinions and interveners obviously have their opinions. But when it comes down to it it's AEP Texas is a transmission and distribution utility. And it's very difficult to disallow costs that are spent from a transmission and a distribution perspective. So that's going to be up to the Texas Commission.","And certainly, we have a different fact patterns than the other one that you referred to. And every case is different, every company is different, the kind of investments are different. So we feel good about our position in AEP Texas. That's why we continue to invest the way we do. So, obviously, we're looking for a positive outcome as a signal to continue investing.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. Thanks, Nick.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Next we'll go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Yes. Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Hey, how are you? Good morning. Great quarter. Congrats.","Nick Akins","Thanks.","Greg Gordon","What is the fascination down in Texas with the idea of ring fencing? I know that it's been proposed in both the -- one of your competitors' pending cases as well as staff positions proposing it in yours. And I'm just wondering what your perspective on that is and where you think they're coming from?","Nick Akins","Yes. It's probably a better question for the commission than for us. But, obviously, during the Encore proceedings that's were sort of all this started. And obviously a company like Encore they wanted to make sure that there are some local type of control. And we're you operating in the state and have been for years.","And I think the commission obviously is interested in how much control is placed within Texas around the assets that they feel like that benefit the state of Texas. So, I suspect you may see some reminiscence of that showing up in various cases, but we have been in and are operating in Texas for a long time and that's not going to change.","Brian Tierney","Greg, the things that's ironic particularly given our situation in Texas is that we are a net investor in Texas. Meaning we're putting debt and equity capital to work in Texas rather than taking it out.","So, for us I think they want to see us continue doing what we've been doing now for years which is investing that capital in Texas rather than taking it out and that's what we intend to continue to do.","Nick Akins","Texas is one of the fastest-growing territories that we have. And we're not going to -- I mean we're not going to fall back on our ability to invest and produce benefits for our customers. And in East Texas obviously we have direct contact with the customers in the portion is at T&D and -- but certainly, I think that this line is getting more and more all the time and that's probably a feature that needs to be discussed in Texas about how to deal with that. But nevertheless that's down for the strategy part of it in the future.","Gregory Gordon","Thank you. Then one more. I know it's early days, but what is the -- so has there been any public response from intervenor groups with regard to the North Central wind proposal? And do we see a more sort of accepting initial response than we did in your wind catcher proposal? Or is it too early to say?","Nick Akins","I'd say it's too early to say. At this point, there's nothing public that's been out there. But I'll say that we purposely filed this to where it had a lot of variability, a lot of optionality to it, and certainly consistent with the ongoing existing processes of the integrated resource planning of each one of the areas.","And I would say just back alone we've had more -- at least a more positive reception of how to deal with it. And so I would have to say things are going reasonably well at this point. And certainly the parties involved know and understand it because after going through wind catcher this one, you can really talk about what the differences are and the beneficial differences.","If they were concerned about transmission don't be concerned about it. If you are concerned about a large area just one area you don't concerned about that either. And if you're concerned about dependency on one area versus no don't worry about that either.","So, I think our processes and with the procedural schedules already defined in every jurisdiction, we're rolling along to a summer of getting the approvals and moving ahead.","Gregory Gordon","Fantastic. Thank you, guys.","Nick Akins","Thanks Greg.","Operator","And next the line of with Greg [Indiscernible] with UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if it's possible to get a preview of the CapEx update at EEI maybe just -- maybe the drivers and I assume the backlog would increase.","Nick Akins","So, I really want to see the detail after EEI. But if you looked at the trends for how we've been spending dollars over the last decade or so, the preponderance of it going to all regulated properties and the preponderance of that going to the wire side of the business. So, that trend that you've seen in the past is going to continue in the detail that we're going to release it yet.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. Look forward.","Nick Akins","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Next move to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Hey Michael.","Michael Lapides","Good morning guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Nick Akins","You got a big game coming up.","Michael Lapides","We got to get a quarter back healthy before we play out -- scare the heck out again. A couple of things. One interest rates, obviously, are way down especially the long end of the curve. Just curious how you're thinking about what this means for not just pension expenses that flow through the income statement, but also pension contributions.","Nick Akins","So, that's a good question. We plan every year as we go into the year to pay to contribute to the pensions about equal to our annual service cost. For the last two years, both 2019 and 2018, we sort of had a funding holiday and the decrease in interest rates has pushed down our funding a little bit really into the mid-90s for pensions and still very well over OPEB, but rates can only go down so much more I think. And so, I think we don't have much downside on the pension fund.","Again, we'll be watching every year what our funding is going to be for next year. We plan on putting in about $100 million for service -- annual service costs, and we still expect the expense side of that equation to be about zero to maybe a slight positive credit.","Brian Tierney","That's a good thing about being well-funded on our pension and OPEB, that gives us a lot of flexibility and there's really no surprises.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then one follow-up. When you think about the docking, especially obviously PSO and the different SWEPCO stage for the North Central Wind's process, how do you think this is different than what you went through with Wind Catcher?","Nick Akins","I think Wind Catcher was a unique situation. I mean we obviously looked at it and thought that there's a great opportunity for all of these jurisdictions. But, at the end of the day, there was a large project and one area with a large generation or connect transmission, whatever you want to call it. And you got hanging up on the risk associated with that, particularly with all the customer savings and trying to figure that out and making sure that everyone was comfortable with that kind of project.","I still stand by it. It was a great project. There's no question about it. But we learned from that. And I think the more you stick with the regulatory processes that the commissions have had longstanding. I mean we've had other renewable projects that we've done the same exact process with that have gone through in their problem.","We want to refashion this thing to make sure it is what everybody expected to see. And when you look at these projects, there's three different wind farms that are involved with that with a lot flexibility on new-in and news-out. And it gives us the ability to not only do that, but also not depend upon additional transmission, so you don't have to focus on that piece of it.","And then also for us to be able to look at the project benefits themselves, those benefits are still substantial. So, I would say that -- and of course, the way it worked out in the bidding itself -- I can't talk about this, but we chose those three projects because they were much better than the others that were bid from a pricing perspective, but also all three of them happen to be with a party that we have continually done business with on a regular basis.","So, we're very comfortable with the deliverability of that -- of those projects. And, we feel confident that the savings that we've presented in the various commission followings are secured, and we're very happy about that.","And then also, part we got hang up a little bit on our own natural gas forecast versus standard natural gas forecast out there. So, even though we thought our forecast was a good one, we decided okay, we're going to just use those standard forecasts for the evaluation, so they buy new that it was coming from an independent party and we wouldn't get into the conversation of your forecast is showing more benefits than another standard forecast. So, we did it from that perspective as well.","I think the other big difference too. We did have a lot of outreach to the individual staff and so forth at the various commission levels with Wind Catcher to try to explain what it was about. Well, it's sort of a natural progression for us to be able to move to the outreach programs that we have, because we've already had substantial discussions of the benefits of wind power in general.","Now, it's a matter of okay, this is what the RFP process is. This is what the wind power that's available, the attractiveness of the wind power and we're going through the regular process to do it. And that communication has been positive, and we've also communicated with other parties in the process too to let them know what's going on. So, I would say that all-in-all, it's been much better and probably a much more pleasant experience than before.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Nick. And one last thing. Tax rates, how should we think about what the consolidated tax rate for income statement reporting purposes is going to be in 2019 liquidity assuming guidance?","Brian Tierney","So, for GAAP taxes, we're anticipating about a 2.6% to 3% effective tax rate for the year, obviously driven down by the amortization of the deferred protected and unprotected taxes. But for 2019, there's also an AMT credit carryforward from prior periods. So that 2.6% to 3% is going to be lower than what we anticipate going forward where we anticipate a rate after the amortization of the deferred taxes to be about 10% going forward.","Michael Lapides","Meaning, if I think about 2020 tax rate and 2021, you're using about 10% for guidance for those years.","Brian Tierney","We are, but -- and let me be clear about that. That's what we're using for guidance. That's what's in our numbers. That's what we figure to be around at 10%. If we were to have incremental income because we're maxing to the 75% allowed for the upper taxes. If we -- I'm sorry for the production tax credits. If you were to have incremental income and you're trying to model that in, you should use a 24% rate. Does that make sense?","Michael Lapides","I think so, but I can follow-up offline guys.","Brian Tierney","So let me just try to be clear. What's in our $4.25 to $4.45 guidance for 2020 assumes an effective tax rate of about 10%. If you were to layer in incremental, you need to use a 24% rate.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Understood. So the -- it have to be a lot of incremental to move the needle on the weighted average.","Brian Tierney","Yes sir.","Michael Lapides","Cool. Thank you, Brian. Much appreciated guys.","Brian Tierney","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Next we'll go to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Brian Tierney","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Storozynski","Good morning. Very few questions. Just going back to the oil and gas related sales. So you mentioned pipeline investments, but we're actually hearing that drillers are switching pump from diesel to electric and that could be a meaningful driver of sales growth of electric companies, but the companies are in our shale regions. Are you seeing this?","Nick Akins","That's been going on for a while actually the conversion to electric. And then also when you look at the transportation fees there's a lot of activity around ability to get out of the shale gas fields and the gas out of the shale gas field. So there's not a lot of optimization on the transmission side. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Yeah, it's a lot of -- rather than just on the pumping side and pipeline transportation, we're seeing a lot of electric compression.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And then to that point, you're showing us that the sensitivity of earnings, the changes in industrial sales is actually very low. So O&M the plan that you gave some efficiencies on the O&M side that you point on there about the EEI that would be actually a more meaningful earnings driver. Is that fair?","Brian Tierney","Yeah. I think the other key areas we look at is if we need to deploy capital and reduce O&M because if you think about load in general, I think this is for many utilities but load in general, you can't have the expectation of ever increasing energy demand. You got to really think about efficiency what it means and what it means to the economy.","And also if you assume that then the way that you continue to grow from a 5% to 7%, which we've confirmed is not only to deploy capital, but to reduce O&M. So it's a huge -- and that's why we say bending the O&M curve or doing those activities. It's going to be a key component in the future, I would say not for us -- but not just for us but for just about every utility.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And lastly so I understand that the rate based renewables are not currently embedded in either your CapEx plan or funding needs. I mean, assuming that mid of next year you get a green light at least on a portion of this incremental CapEx, you probably have incremental equity needs to fund this spending, would you consider some, sort of, an optimization of your current portfolio as a way to pay for the CapEx?","Brian Tierney","Yes, we would and I think one of the big processes we have going forward will be around optimization of our balance sheet and capital rotation and capital management and asset management goes with that. Obviously it would be a great opportunity to get the wind power resources and we'll be looking at all kinds of methods to be able to fund that investment.","Angie Storozynski","Very good. Thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thank you.","Darcy Reese","Hey John, we have time for one more call.","Operator","And that will be from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Good morning.","Brian Tierney","Good morning.","Ali Agha","First question, Brian or Nick, I just wanted to understand the philosophy behind the annual dividend changes. As you mentioned last year, you moved it up 8%. And I believe that was to get you to the midpoint of your payout ratio. This year it\u2019s 4.5%, perhaps being a little below that midpoint, so just thinking the lumpiness there. How should we think about the philosophy behind that?","Brian Tierney","Yeah. We're trying to keep it right in the middle of the payout range and that's what we do. This year -- you put last year and this year together, it's above the midpoint of our long-term growth rate for earnings. And I think the Board is trying to reward investors by keeping it right in the midpoint of that 60% to 70% stated payout ratio.","Nick Akins","It's just unfortunate that we have quarters and years around the annual calendar and stuff like that. But lot of times you're looking at these the dividend side of things and of course it's going to move generally in that 5% to 7%. And it's been no secret that's tagged around the 6% range. And we are committed to stay firmly in the middle of that 60% to 70% payout range.","But there's a lot of things to consider. I mean, we got the same questions, when we did 8.1% last year. What does that mean?","So we're reiterating that, it will be in line with our 5% to 7% growth rate. But year-to-year you see just things that kind of round off on pennies and that kind of thing. But there should not be any interpretation that our Board feel differently about the prospects of growth of this company in the future.","And so, we debated that quite a bit, because we did want to reaffirm this 5% to 7% growth rate. So, don't read anything into it.","Ali Agha","Got you and then, last question, with regards to the 2020 range, 4 25 to 4.45. I mean that was provides with a long-time back. I think, EEI, if I recall it, lots has happened and got some very good rate case outcomes in Oklahoma, et cetera.","So any thought on that, I mean I expect 2019 is turning out that maybe you could move that up or maybe the upper half or upper end more comfortable, as we sit here today, any thoughts around that?","Brian Tierney","We're just -- we're going to refresh at EEI, Ali. But Nick always says we'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of the range. And I think that's going to be true, for 2019 and 2020.","Nick Akins","And probably some of these things just sort of have to prove themselves out over time. And we went to 5% to 7% after we sold the unregulated generation we were at 4% to 6% at that point, because we felt like that 5% to 7% was something that we saw going forward for the long-term.","It is a long-term growth rate. So, we'll have to see. Obviously, we're seeing some positive outcomes. And we continue to see that. The question is okay, how sustainable is that on a long-term basis going forward, based on what we see today.","And we're comfortable with the 5% to 7%. We're getting more comfortable with the upper ranges of 5% to 7%. But, before you change to 6% to 8% or are you asking if I can, you have to be able to credibly see that for the long-term. And that\u2019s something you have to sort of warm over to overtime.","Ali Agha","I understood. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Yeah.","Darcy Reese","Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. John, would you please give the replay information.","Operator","Certainly, ladies and gentlemen, the replay starts today at 11:15 a.m. Eastern and will last until October 31 at midnight.

","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas Akins","Thanks Betty Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for AEP\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. I know many of you are happy to get 2017 in the rear view mirror and move onto 2018, but I would say that we ended 2017 very strong. I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call for those who watch Game of Thrones, Khaleesi\u2019s dragons didn\u2019t show up for the heat of the summer but we definitely spent the beginning of winter at the North Wall of the White Walkers - it was really cold. As a matter of fact, one of my family members had the great idea that I could barbecue chicken wings on New Year\u2019s Day for the football games, so I was outside in 10 degree weather grilling wings. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do that again. But all in all, though I was cold outside as a shareholder, I was warm inside as we sold a lot of comfort to our customers during this cold spell. ","So starting with our financial performance for the fourth quarter, we came in with GAAP earnings at $0.81 per share versus $0.76 per share in 2016, and operating earnings at $0.85 per share and $0.67 per share in 2016. This brought the 2017 year-to-date total GAAP earnings to $3.89 per share versus $1.24 per share in 2016, and 2017 year-to-date total operating earnings to $3.68 per share versus $3.94 per share in 2016. The $3.68 per share for 2017 landed at the top end of our revised guidance, so we ended in very good fashion leading into 2018, and looking at AEP\u2019s total shareholder return, we have consistently over the last one, three and five-year periods provided comparable returns to the S&P 500 and consistently outperformed by a wide margin the S&P 500 electric utilities index, the very definition of a premium regulated utility company.","Our regulated operating ROE came in at 9.5% return for the year, and in 2017 we increased the quarterly dividend by 5.1%, so even with the headwinds of weather and the need for rate case recovery, AEP provided a very respectable year to our investors while providing quality service to our customers.","Our employees continue to drive efficiencies across our business, which certainly played a significant role in meeting shareholder expectations in 2017. We dealt with major storm events with Hurricane Harvey, which was a direct hit to our AEP Texas territory, as well as provided support in Florida as a result of Hurricane Irma. We currently have AEP employees in devastated Puerto Rico helping with the recovery and rebuilding efforts there as well and certainly wish them a safe return.","For 2018, we are maintaining our guidance range for the year of $3.75 to $3.95 per share and reaffirming our growth rate of 5 to 7% operating earnings. We will be investing $6 billion in capital substantially in the regulated entities, with the vast majority of that being wires related to provide reliability and quality of service to our customers. Disciplined execution and capital allocation will be key for us to meet our financial objectives. Obviously the rate case outcomes in the various jurisdictions that I will discuss later will be a key component of these allocation decisions.","I was recently asked what song would be a good one to pick for this quarter to illustrate the quarter, and it has to be Taxman by the Beatles. Tax reform has definitely been at the forefront, taking center stage. As we adjust the outcome of tax reform, our focus is no different - allocation of capital, maintaining credit quality, and ensuring our consistent growth trajectory. In this case, we are also working with our state commissions to provide tax reform benefits to our customers as well, whether it be rate reductions, accelerated depreciation, additional capital projects that provide value to our customers, or other opportunities.","We also, because of our strong credit metrics, are able to maintain a significant portion of our capital investment plans while not issuing any additional equity beyond what we provided at the last EEI financial conference. Brian will discuss this a little bit later.","As you know, we have several rate cases that were filed in 2017 that we expect outcomes generally in early 2018. Rate case filings were made in Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas, and we still have an outstanding ESP case in Ohio that we await the outcome as well. Additionally, as you all know, we\u2019ve filed for state regulatory approvals for the Wind Catcher project in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas.","First regarding Wind Catcher, I\u2019m very pleased with the cases our teams are putting forward in all the jurisdictions. Sure, investors in opposition do what interveners do, but overall our regulatory teams have demonstrated the benefits of the project. The schedules in the various jurisdictions continue to be largely on path to complete in a timely basis for approvals. We are having settlement discussions where they can occur, and we\u2019ll continue to do so where appropriate. Wind Catcher is a very unique opportunity, and our willingness to take on risk associated with this project while also providing all the benefits to the customers is a testament that we really are trying to do something good for customers. ","AEP is advancing this project because we believe strongly in the benefits it will provide Day 1 to our customers, our environment, and to the economies of the states involved. Because we provide such a critical service to our customers and communities we serve, AEP has a public trust to balance the needs of our investors with our customers and our other stakeholders. We are in a very critical time in the life of this project, and this is where AEP, our customers and our regulators need to make this happen. In my mind, it would be an absolute travesty to let this unique hedge against the market pass, and I remain confident that it will get done.","All the rate cases continue to move forward. Commission orders have been received in Texas and Kentucky that were generally constructive, and we await orders in Indiana, Michigan and Oklahoma as well as the ESP case in Ohio. All the cases are moving according to plan, and the next couple of quarters will certainly answer many rate-related and ROE questions in these jurisdictions. We are certainly hopeful that the Oklahoma commission will revise the ALJ\u2019s recommendation in the rate case to send a message that Oklahoma is truly open for business and allow AEP to continue to make substantial investments in the energy infrastructure in that state.","As we have explained previously, we have the best customer satisfaction, the best service quality and the lowest rates. We just need to be able to attract a fair return on our investments in Oklahoma. After our previous disappointing rate case and a disappointing ALJ recommendation on our current case, we are hopeful that the Oklahoma commission will arrest this negative trend. With an authorized ROE of 9.5% but actually only recovering a 6% ROE, and if the ALJ recommendation has approved in its presence form only a 5% ROE, these results would be unattractive given AEP\u2019s other investment opportunities. Now that PSO is on negative credit outlook by Moody\u2019s, a positive result is even more important.","So now I\u2019ll move to the equalizer graph and explain some of the cases that we have ongoing. First of all, overall we\u2019ve continued to have a 9.5% ROE, and over the 12-month period we have had some delays during the year that moved into \u201918, and certainly weather has impacted \u201917 as well overall. You\u2019ll hear that in many of the cases going across the equalizer graph. So for AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of fourth quarter 2017 was 14.2%, but you have to keep in mind that that 14.2% includes the legacy issues that were resolved from the global settlements that had been done earlier, so really when you look at the seed-adjusted ROE, we\u2019re right around 10% in AEP Ohio, so we\u2019re in a good place there. Those legacy issues will roll off over time - some roll off in \u201918, some roll off in \u201919, so you\u2019ll start to see those two bubbles come closer together and in fact become the same bubble as we move forward.","As far as APCo is concerned, the ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter was 8.9%, which it was 8.4% at the end of the third quarter, so they are making progress; but again, it reflects weather for the entire year. They\u2019re overall at a good place right now.","Kentucky Power, we obviously--that was a work in progress last year. It was 4.5% ROE at the end of third quarter, 5.1%, so it\u2019s moving up a little bit. It should move up even more now given that we have an outcome of a rate case. That rate case, the final order approved a $12.4 million increase, and it was--the settlement was actually adjusted there for certainly the impacts of tax reform. So all in all, constructive outcome from that perspective. Long-term solution for Kentucky Power, though, will again--the rates was only a part of it. The other is the economic development that\u2019s occurring in those regions, and we are getting some positive progress there relative placements of large manufacturing in our territories, so that\u2019s a good outcome, and we expect that to continue to improve.","I&M achieved an ROE of 8.4% at the end of the fourth quarter 2017, which is unchanged from third quarter. Again, you probably know we have Indiana case and our Michigan case, both rate cases filed in those jurisdictions, and would expect an outcome of those in the next couple of quarters. So those cases move forward and certainly that should help to improve I&M.","As far as PSO is concerned, we\u2019ve already talked about that pretty extensively at this point. Their fourth quarter ROE was 6.2% versus 6.1% at the end of the third quarter, and of course we\u2019re looking for the Oklahoma commission to adjust the recommendations of the ALJ at this point and hopefully have a good outcome associated with that rate case, which we expect an order very soon. That will certainly bode well for the continuation of Wind Catcher, and certainly that case continues to move forward in Oklahoma as well, so a lot of cases coming in and Oklahoma is at the epicenter of the activity associated with investments that we\u2019re making.","SWEPCO, ROE at SWEPCO at the end of the fourth quarter was 6.4%, at the end of the third quarter it was 5.9%. We did get a final order on the PUCT case, Public Utility Commission of Texas, that was constructive, so we expect that ROE to continue to improve as well. Just keep in mind, we still have that 88 megawatts of Turk hanging out there that will continue to be a slight drag to the ROE overall of SWEPCO.","So as we look at AEP Texas, AEP Texas at the end of fourth quarter 2017 was 10%, and it was 10.3% last quarter, and AEP Texas decreased due to a tax refund that dropped out of the calculation that was taking place in there. Of course, AEP Transmission, the ROE for AEP Transmission holdco at the end of fourth quarter was 12.6%. It was 12.7% at the end of third quarter 2017, so fairly consistent, and we continue to see great things from AEP Transmission and we expect that to continue. ","So overall, regulated operations at 9.5% and we\u2019ll continue to see--all those, as we\u2019ve discussed with you earlier, gives you a very good view of the ones that need to move up and those that are in the middle of rate cases, and we expect those outcomes in the next couple of quarters, so that will be very instructive to us going forward relative to where we put our investments. ","So for fourth quarter \u201917, it was an outstanding quarter, and the year\u2019s results exemplify the resiliency and the commitment of AEP\u2019s employees to deliver consistent earnings and dividend quality, regardless of the headwinds that may exist. We\u2019re very proud of 2017, and as we move into 2018, the year of tax reform, Wind Catcher, rate cases, and also forging ahead with Smart Cities, Ohio\u2019s PowerForward project, and other forward-thinking initiatives, this will set the tone for the years to come.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian at this point. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll take us through the fourth quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, discuss tax reform, and finish with a review of our outlook for 2018. ","Let\u2019s begin on Slide 7, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.85 per share or $420 million, compared to $0.67 per share or $330 million in 2016. All of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter compared to last year, and as expected our competitive generation and marketing business was down due to last year\u2019s asset sales. All the detail by segment is shown in the boxes on the chart, but overall the growth in our regulated business was driven by lower O&M, return on incremental investment, and positive weather impacts all partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.05 per share, down a nickel from last year. The impact of the sale of the competitive assets was partially offset by lower operating expenses on the remaining assets and higher trading revenues. Corporate and other was up $0.05 per share from last year primarily due to lower O&M and favorable tax adjustments.","Turning to Slide 8, our annual operating earnings for 2017 were $3.68 per share or $1.8 billion, compared to $3.94 per share or $1.9 billion in 2016. This difference can be primarily attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of the competitive generation assets, and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year. Offsetting these were lower O&M, higher transmission earnings, and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. ","Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.64 per share, down $0.37 with one of the largest drivers being weather, which had a negative impact of $0.18. This difference was driven by the warm summer in 2016 which increased our cooling load compared to the warm winter in 2017, which decreased our heating load. Favorable prior year items also contributed to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia, and positive tax adjustments. Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions, and we reduced O&M in response to the unfavorable weather in 2017. Additional variances in this segment include higher depreciation and taxes other than income taxes, along with lower AFUDC. ","The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $1.01 per share, up $0.06. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue, the prior year Ohio global settlement, and lower O&M. These were offset by several items, including lower normalized load, the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, and higher depreciation and taxes. The AEP Transmission holdco segment earned $0.72 per share, up $0.18 over 2016. The growth in earnings over last year largely reflected our return on incremental investment. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by $2.1 billion, an increase of 52% since last December. The growth in earnings also reflected the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates as well as the normal historical expense true-up. Finally, we experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement in 2017. ","Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.30 per share, down $0.20 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of assets. Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, positive impacts from solar projects going into service, higher trading revenues, lower taxes, and lower overall costs. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.07 per share from last year due to investment gains, lower O&M, and taxes. ","2017 was a re-basing year following the sale of the competitive generation assets. We are pleased with our operating earnings for the year which were achieved despite the headwinds from very mild weather. ","Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 9 to review weather-normalized load. Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 1.6% this quarter and ended the year up three-tenths of a percent. It has taken some time, but we finally saw the growth in residential sales we expected following the steady expansion of industrial sales that started last spring, particularly in the west. ","Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 5.6% for the quarter and ended the year up 2.8%. There were two reasons for this increase. First, we saw broad industrial sales growth across most of our operating companies and industries this quarter. In fact, our five largest industrial sectors experienced nearly 11% growth this quarter, led by chemicals and primary metals. Second, in the fourth quarter two large co-generators on our system took their units offline for routine maintenance and purchased their needs from us.","Moving to the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were up two-tenths of a percent for the quarter and down 1.2% for the year. The story here differs by geography. Residential sales were up 1.8% in our western footprint where customer counts increased by seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter. In the east, however, residential sales declined by nine-tenths of a percent despite the three-tenths of a percent increase in customer counts. ","Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 1.2%, bringing the year-to-date normalized contraction to eight-tenths of a percent. Commercial sales declined at every operating company in 2017 except AEP Texas, with the most pronounced drop in Appalachian and Kentucky Power. Despite this, we still expect a modest improvement in 2018 as the economic recovery works its way through the business cycle.","Next, let\u2019s review the status of our regional economies on Slide 10. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U.S. by nearly seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter. Higher energy prices and the strong global economy in 2017 were the primary drivers for this improvement. For the quarter, the western footprint grew at 3.4% with the growth in our eastern territory following close behind at 3.3%. The bottom left chart shows the gap in employment growth is closing between AEP and the U.S. Once again, the strongest job growth occurred in our western territory at 1.3%, which was only a tenth of a percent behind the U.S. Employment growth in our eastern territory closely followed at 1.1%.","The final chart to the right shows the net jobs created in AEP service territory in 2017 by sector. In total, there were approximately 87,000 more people working in AEP\u2019s footprint at the end of 2017 than at the start of the year. Over 60% of the new jobs added in 2017 came from three categories: education and health services, professional business services, and manufacturing. These categories typically represent higher wage jobs which should support residential sales growth in 2018. The exception was the retail sector, which lost nearly 5,500 jobs in 2017. As you know, more people are choosing to shop online as opposed to traditional big box stores. Despite this outlier, we are encouraged by the momentum of economic trends in our service territory and still expect modest growth in 2018. ","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 11 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased nine-tenths of a percent during the quarter to 55.5%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 18.7%, and our net liquidity stood at about $2.3 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding improved approximately one percentage point to 101%. Despite a lower discount rate, gains from plan assets outpaced an increase in the plan liability due to strong market returns. ","Our OPAB funding improved 18 percentage points during the quarter to 130% primarily due to strong investment returns and a change in the medical coverage for post-65 retirees. This change lowered the estimated OPAB liability and annual expense. The estimated cost for both plants in 2018 is expected to reduce after-tax expense by $53 million.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 now and talk about tax reform. Remember back two years ago when bonus depreciation was extended. At that time, we were getting increased cash due to not having to pay cash taxes. In response, the company did what Congress had hoped it would do and increased our capital expenditures for the benefit of our customers. This increase in capex had the effect of offsetting increased ADIT balances, so the story that we talked about then was lower cash taxes, increased retained cash, increased capex, increased customer benefits, and steady growth rate.","In contrast to that story, let\u2019s talk about what tax reform and the elimination of bonus depreciation means to AEP - lower taxes, lower cash metrics, but also reduced ADIT balances, so if we largely maintain our capital spending program for the benefit of customers in the face of lower cash metrics, then we can maintain our previously forecasted growth rates. That is exactly what we plan to do. We plan to maintain our capital spending forecast of approximately $6 billion in 2018 and $6.2 billion in 2019, and to reduce our 2020 capital spending forecast by $500 million to about $5.5 billion. Our credit metrics will move from the high end of the Baa1 range to the lower end, but we do not anticipate raising incremental equity due to tax reform. We still anticipate raising $100 million through equity programs in each year 2018 through 2020, and an additional $400 million in 2020. This represents no change in equity needs from what we discussed with you at EEI in November, and we are reaffirming our 5 to 7% growth rate. Finally, as was the case at EEI in November, this plan does not include Wind Catcher. ","Two other questions we often get are related to the deductibility of interest on parent debt and whether or not we have a significant net operating loss carry-forward. We expect interest on our parent debt to be mostly tax deductible and we are going into 2018 without a significant net NOL. Most of our state commissions have already opened documents related to changes in the tax law. We have begun working with regulators to determine the appropriate mechanisms to provide the customer benefits of both the change in tax rate and the excess ADIT. We have several options, including decreasing rates, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation, and offsetting other rate increases. Overall, we\u2019ll maintain our credit metrics in the Baa1 range and stay within our earnings growth rate of 5 to 7% while customers get the benefit of continued investment and lower taxes. ","Let\u2019s try to wrap this up on Slide 13 so we can get to your questions. We begin 2018 with a solid track record. Regulated earnings were strong in 2017 as we continue to invest capital in our regulated businesses. For seven years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. In addition, over time we have grown our dividend with earnings, and expect to be able to do so going forward. Last year, AEP\u2019s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 5.1% on an annual basis. ","Looking ahead to 2018, we are reiterating our operating earnings guidance of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. We are also confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5 to 7% operating earnings growth rate. We will finalize our pending rate cases, obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project, and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution around the customer benefits of tax reform. ","With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is open.","Nicholas Akins","Hey Greg, how are you?","Greg Gordon","Oh, I can\u2019t complain. It\u2019s still cold here, but we know that\u2019s good for demand, so I\u2019ll take it.","Nicholas Akins","That\u2019s good.","Greg Gordon","Brian, a couple questions for you. First, I was modestly distracted when you mentioned that you\u2019re making a reduction in expenses due to change in benefit costs. That was a prospective savings of how much?","Brian Tierney","It\u2019s going to be a credit for us to costs of about $53 million.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you. Then you said parent interest expense would be mostly tax deductible, which means it\u2019s not completely tax deductible. Can you elaborate on why you chose that language?","Brian Tierney","Yes Greg, so the IRS hasn\u2019t written their rules yet, but we think what\u2019s allowed for in the tax law is that parent company interest expense can be allocated to both our regulated properties and to our competitive businesses. In the regulated properties, they will be fully deductible; in our competitive properties, we\u2019ll have significant EBITDA to be able to deduct that as well. What will be left behind will be a very small portion which will be allocable to the parent, which doesn\u2019t have EBITDA associated with it, and that\u2019s the small portion that we think will not be deductible. ","Greg Gordon","Can you quantify for us at this time a range of dollars in terms of debt that you think will not qualify?","Brian Tierney","About $1 million tax affected. ","Greg Gordon","Okay, so which really is de minimis.","Brian Tierney","I couldn\u2019t say zero and be fully forthcoming. There is a small part that\u2019s left.","Greg Gordon","Fair enough now you\u2019ve disclosed it - thank you. Did you say that the major factor that drove industrial demand up in the fourth quarter was these two co-gen facilities shutting down and taking demand from you, and so that\u2019s why you don\u2019t consider that an ongoing trajectory of demand?","Brian Tierney","No, that was a small portion of it. We think the larger portion of it was really the broad growth across most of our industrial sectors.","Greg Gordon","So why are you sort of reverting to a very low expected demand growth forecast in 2018? Is that out of a function of conservatism or are you fairly confident you\u2019re seeing things in the Q4 data that were not permanent?","Brian Tierney","It\u2019s that small portion that was associated with the co-gens that\u2019s not permanent, and again we don\u2019t want to overstate the industrial growth because of that portion, and as we look forward and forecast the full year 2018, we look at what we think are expansions, we look at what we think the growth rate it, and we think we\u2019ve got that forecasted appropriately with the essentially flat that we\u2019re estimating for industrial in 2018.","Greg Gordon","Okay. My last question and then I\u2019ll cede the floor, it looks to me that the ALJ position in Oklahoma, which looks incredibly confiscatory to me as well, is as much as an $0.08 or $0.09 swing in the expected earnings versus what you asked for in the case. Now, that would be well within the range of guidance you gave for 2018, so is it fair that even though there is a fairly large swing in outcomes there, that you reiterated your guidance because you\u2019re so comfortable you can be in there? Then the second question is, what\u2019s your recourse to Oklahoma if they in fact, other than just pulling capital out of the state or selling the company if indeed the ALJ decision comes down as approved as rendered? ","Nicholas Akins","Greg, certainly our guidance that we\u2019ve given, we\u2019re very comfortable with that guidance that we\u2019ve given, and actually Oklahoma is one of our smaller jurisdictions, so--but that being said, we still expect a good outcome in Oklahoma. On your second point, I think when you go in one case, which was our previous case, and you\u2019re looking to repair the balance sheet and make sure that PSO is moving forward in a positive fashion from an investment standpoint, we pulled several hundred million dollars of investment out of Oklahoma after that last rate case, and the present rate case, to have an ALJ recommendation that\u2019s not helpful at all in terms of continuing the recovering of PSO, if the commission follows suit with that, that\u2019s just another really bad message about investment in Oklahoma. ","We have other places to put our capital. We have plenty of places to put our capital, and so Oklahoma would wind up being sort of in the red area like Kentucky was. That\u2019s something we take very seriously because we want to make investment in Oklahoma. It\u2019s a well-run utility, as I said earlier. When you look at the performance of PSO in relation to its customers and the rate making and everything, it doesn\u2019t deserve the ROE recommendation and it doesn\u2019t deserve the outcomes that we\u2019re getting in Oklahoma. So we have to look at that and see what the broad view is.","Now there again, it is an ALJ recommendation, and the commission itself will be making the determination, and we\u2019re certainly hopeful that those adjustments will be made and that\u2019s what we expect to happen. You brought up the issues of what the responses could be - obviously we could pull capital out of Oklahoma, we could look at strategic options for Oklahoma, but that\u2019s really--let\u2019s don\u2019t get there yet, because we\u2019re going to let the commission speak on this. I really believe that the commission will be responsive, so let\u2019s just wait and see what that order looks like.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you guys. Have a great day.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys.","Nicholas Akins","How you doing, Jonathan?","Jonathan Arnold","Good, thank you. Thanks for all the clarity that you\u2019ve given this morning. One question on--can you give us some sort of sense of where you think the rate base for (indiscernible) to get out to 2020 shakes out versus the--I think you have 13.1 as the forecast at EEI.","Brian Tierney","Yes, what we\u2019d previously shown you at EEI was a CAGR for that over the 18 to 20 period of about 8%. We anticipate it will be about 9%. ","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, Brian. Presumably as we\u2019re sort of thinking about the earnings implications, the main offset is the higher financing costs on more debt with the lower FFO, increasing your financing needs albeit without equity.","Brian Tierney","Our rating is going to stay the same--","Jonathan Arnold","No, no, but you have more debt, obviously, in the forecast.","Brian Tierney","True. ","Jonathan Arnold","So to that, I was going to--I mean, you\u2019re now talking about mid-teens as your FFO to debt target. I think one of the slides from EEI was sort of mid to high teens. Can you give us sort of hundreds of basis points net effect of what you think is going to happen to that metric? ","Brian Tierney","Yes, so Jonathan, remember we were showing in the upper teens back then and people were saying to us, hey, you need to consume more of that balance sheet capacity and grow more than what you\u2019re showing, and what we always said to people back then was, we anticipate being a significant taxpayer around 2020 and that\u2019s going to consumer some of that balance sheet and drop us from the high teens into the mid-teens. We\u2019re now anticipating bottoming out in the 14% FFO to debt range before we start climbing again. ","Nicholas Akins","I\u2019ll just add onto that, I think it\u2019s probably a testament to the sound financial condition of what Brian and the team has been doing for this organization, to be able to absorb the tax reform implications without issuing additional equity. I mean, in essence what we\u2019re doing is trading FFO to debt and that ability to carry that against not having to issue equity, so it\u2019s a positive outcome for our shareholders.","Jonathan Arnold","Absolutely, we just wanted to get behind what\u2019s in those numbers. Then finally as we try to compare the capex, where you\u2019re taking the $500 million out of the 2020 number, it looks like you\u2019ve got some moving parts in there, but the corporate pieces, I was just curious what\u2019s behind that and some of the other moving parts in the capex forecast.","Brian Tierney","Jonathan, it\u2019s really going to be across the breadth of our businesses. Transmission will be a bit of that, environmental will be a piece of that. Contracted renewables will be a small piece of that. It will largely be spread across our business, but our interest in terms of how we allocate capital, transmission is still a preferred place for us to put capital, distribution and the wire side is still a preferred place for us to put capital, and there will be small portions associated with competitive renewable and some portion still associated with environmental at our generation. So largely spread across our businesses, but our preferences for where we put capital to work will remain the same.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, and then just finally, do you see this as pretty set, or is there a chance that the numbers shift around a bit depending on how your conversations with states go, which you\u2019re obviously saying are in process?","Brian Tierney","So clearly that portion about how we allocate the excess deferred income tax back to our customers is something that\u2019s in play, and since it\u2019s in play across 11 jurisdictions, all of which may have different interests, that\u2019s something that we will firm up over time. We don\u2019t anticipate there to be a strategic change in our numbers that would have our capital and financing plans change materially.","Nicholas Akins","Unless of course we get Wind Catcher.","Brian Tierney","Well Wind Catcher, of course, is a big change. I was answering the question in regards to tax reform. Wind Catcher is a big change and that would clearly require us to come back out to you and explain how we\u2019re going to finance that.","Jonathan Arnold","And is the assumption that Wind Catcher would displace other things, or is it partially incremental? Can you remind us how we should think about that?","Brian Tierney","Jonathan, it\u2019s a $4.5 billion project, so that is a significant change to what we\u2019ve talked about in our capital and financing plans, so we\u2019d need to come out to you and tell you a complete story about what Wind Catcher means, when we get approvals and when we decide to go forward with that project. ","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nicholas Akins","Morning Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hey, good morning. A couple questions, first on the Wind Catcher. You had talked about making a decision by maybe March-April, I think. Is that the still rough timeline, you think? ","Nicholas Akins","Yes, I think the schedules are still moving towards April. We had a two-week delay in Texas for the tax reform implications, but the other jurisdictions are pretty well--have pretty well stayed intact, so we\u2019re still looking at the same time frame and really we need to make that we get those kinds of responses so that we can make decisions about the other commitments relative to the project. We\u2019re still in good shape.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, and in terms of just your conviction level on it, it seems like the recommendations so far have generally not been that good in any of the states, or maybe one of them, so I\u2019m just--but you did talk about maybe some settlement talks in certain states. Maybe you could talk about which ones are able, and why you\u2019d be convinced you can still get this moving forward?","Nicholas Akins","Yes, so many of these recommended rejections have been caveated with, okay, if you do move forward, we need these kinds of protections in place, and that really tends to be the center of the discussion and the center of the testimony. The thing is these cases, and you probably read the transcripts like I do - I get irritated with the transcripts half the time because it\u2019s really arguments on the fringes, and a lot more discussion needs to be had about the benefits of the project and the benefits of a hedge and that kind of thing, but you argue on the fringes and a lot of it is risk adjustments associated with the project that allow for customer protections to be in place relative to the project benefits. We\u2019re certainly encouraging that all interveners propose what they want to get approved. ","There is obviously--you know, as we go through discussions with the interveners, it\u2019s important for us to be able to have those discussions wherever we can, and certainly we\u2019re having those discussions certainly with Oklahoma and in Texas. Those discussions continue. I can\u2019t really talk about the content of those discussions because obviously they\u2019re confidential, but again we\u2019ve made additional guarantees and rebuttal testimony, we\u2019ve put that out as a framework for those customer protection type of mechanisms, and you might suspect that\u2019s where the dialog is centered.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, but Oklahoma is one of the states where you might have discussions, as you say?","Nicholas Akins","Oh yes, and you know, that\u2019s really where the framework originated and the rebuttal testimony. Like I said, it\u2019s in a critical part of the Wind Catcher timeline when you\u2019re in this time frame with the testimony done and being able to have those kinds of discussions, so. As far as confidence level is concerned, I\u2019m still very happy with the way this project looks, and even with tax reform, because a lot of times it gets hung up with what we call our ultra-low gas case, and it\u2019s not really even a gas case. It was really made up - we took our low gas case and we stress-tested the project at 50% of whatever those gas costs. It\u2019s far less than NYMEX is now, and so that\u2019s why I say a lot of the arguments are on the fringes, talking about things that really haven\u2019t happened. So if we can just get the dialog to where it\u2019s a reasonable type of discussion, then we\u2019ll be in good shape.","You know, I testified in a case in Oklahoma in the 90s. There was a rail spur in the northeastern, and the commission--the Oklahoma commission approved that and we got capital recovery on the project, but it benefited in terms of fuel costs. This is no different. Matter of fact, we\u2019ve got more customer protection mechanisms in a rebuttal than we ever had anything like that, so when you look at what\u2019s going on in this case, we have stepped up to provide answers to the concerns that the interveners have had, and again caveated by--they certainly recommended rejection, but at the same time they said, okay, let\u2019s work on these customer protection mechanisms, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","Steve Fleishman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Julien Demoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. ","Nicholas Akins","Good morning, how are you doing?","Julien Demoulin-Smith","Good, thank you very much. Let me follow up on Steve\u2019s question just a quick bit, because I want to understand a little bit around the compartmentalization of Wind Catcher to the extent to which should one piece or another fall away as part of the approval process, can you ultimately move forward with this under a smaller context, or perhaps just under the wind or the transmission piece? Just want to frame the risk of the project moving forward again as you work through the settlement, and obviously I don\u2019t want to necessarily prejudge anything with respect to the settlement either. I obviously heard what you just said.","Nicholas Akins","I\u2019m with you on that - let\u2019s don\u2019t prejudge it. But I would say that we\u2019re certainly expecting all the states to give approval to it. You can\u2019t really re-size this project. The benefit of this project is its size, its proximity, where it\u2019s located in western Oklahoma with high capacity factor wind, and with the transmission sized accordingly to serve that capacity, I think you\u2019re getting maximum benefit in terms of the value proposition to customers. I\u2019d have to say--you know, we\u2019re just going to have look and see what outcomes. We\u2019re expecting all states to approve it. If all states don\u2019t approve it, then we\u2019ll just have to look at it at the time, because I think there may be other takers out there that might be interested, so we\u2019ll see. But I really think that as we go forward, it will be pretty important for us to take a hard look at that project and understanding the benefits of that project, we\u2019ll make a determination whether we move forward or not, based upon the way the jurisdictions respond. That\u2019s really probably all we need to say at this point, because we want to make this project moves ahead.","Now that being said, I will say that we are not going to move forward with a project that we don\u2019t feel like is beneficial not only to our customers - obviously it\u2019s beneficial to our customer, but our shareholders have to benefit as well, and we have a lot of places we can put our capital, and we just need to make sure it\u2019s done--as I mentioned earlier in my opening, the allocation of capital is going to be extremely important for us to focus in and prioritize our investments to ensure we meet our financial objectives. Wind Catcher is only a part of that - actually, it\u2019s incremental to the entire plan that we have today, and we\u2019re going to make sure it stands on its own merits. ","So that being said, I\u2019m still confident.","Julien Demoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. Going back to a little bit more detail on the prior conversation around the impact of tax reform and flowing that back into the state, regulatory commission processes, can you give us a little bit of a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about that across the various states? I mean, there\u2019s a number of ways that you could presumably approach this in terms of both addressing perhaps unrecovered items, accelerating investment, returning benefits to customers, etc. Maybe a little bit of a flavor as you think about the various states.","Nicholas Akins","Yes, it\u2019s an all-of-the-above type of thing, because state jurisdictions are going to look at it differently based upon their own individual situations. Kentucky already took advantage of part of it. We also have areas where we can accelerate depreciation or adjust plant balances or those types of things, so I think it\u2019s particularly important for us to be mindful of where each individual jurisdiction, where the touch points are, and be able to address that.","Now, I think that obviously lowering rates to customers is a critical component of this, but at the same time there are distinct opportunities that we\u2019ve had discussions with commissions about previously that we could take advantage of and really have a real positive outcome for not only the customers but also in terms of ensuring that we\u2019re moving ahead in a positive way, whether that\u2019s capital investment to focus on the customer experience, whether it\u2019s certainly things we can do with plant balances to accelerate depreciation and so forth. So all those are things to be discussed, and we\u2019ll have--I really believe we\u2019ll have reasonable outcomes from a commission perspective, and we\u2019ll go forward.","Julien Demoulin-Smith","Excellent, thank you very much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much, hi guys. ","Nicholas Akins","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Morning. So just on tax reform, wanted to dig into one other topic on it. Looking at your EEI slides and the drop relative to that in your cash flow from operations for \u201918 and \u201919 is about $700 million to $800 million, wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving that drop? Is it one of the bonus depreciation to makers, is it the revenue requirement coming down? Just wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving it, and if there are any that can move as a result of all the negotiations that you\u2019re talking about right now.","Brian Tierney","The part that moves as a part of the negotiations is really the billion or so of excess ADIT, and what we\u2019ve shown in the slide in the deck on Page 36 is what we believe is a conservative allotment of that. I\u2019m not going to go into what it is specifically, but we believe we\u2019ve been conservative as what that excess ADIT flow-back will be. Everything else, the numbers kind of work out the way they work out. Of course, we\u2019re going to be a lower taxpayer than what we thought, we\u2019re going to have PTCs and investment tax credits included in those numbers that will also impact making us much less of a taxpayer than we were, but in terms of risk, it\u2019s about a billion dollars of excess ADIT, and as Nick was describing, there are going to be thoughtful negotiations going on across all of our jurisdictions as to what\u2019s the best way to have that have an impact for our customers.","Praful Mehta","Got it, so from a rating agency perspective, the drop--given you had accretion, I guess, going in, in terms of your FFO to debt, there is not a requirement to do anything at the back end given your metrics are improving by the back end, and you already had cushion, is that the way to think about the FFO to debt going forward?","Brian Tierney","That\u2019s right. Praful, we were starting in a position of strength relative to our credit metrics against our ratings, and the reason we were in that position of strength was we anticipated being taxpayers in 2020 and we described that to rating agencies and investors. People understood that those metrics were going to deteriorate over time, but still stay within the metrics that are appropriate for our current ratings. Now that we\u2019re not going to be a big taxpayer but our cash metrics are going to come in line with our ratings over time, and we don\u2019t think that will be an issue for the rating agencies and we don\u2019t think it will have an impact on our ratings. ","Praful Mehta","Got you, fair enough. Finally just in terms of load growth, again in the EEI deck you had load growth of, I think for 2018, 0.7%, which is now down to 0.2% for 2018. I know you touched on this earlier as well with, I think, Greg\u2019s question, but just wanted to get any more color on what led to the drop in \u201918, anything we should be focused on, and is that \u201918 number more of a steady state, do you think? ","Brian Tierney","Yes, so our numbers for \u201918 essentially stayed the same. The fourth quarter of \u201917 came in stronger than what we thought it was going to be, so the adjustment means less of an increase in \u201918 even though our numbers in \u201918 stayed about the same. Does that make sense?","Nicholas Akins","It\u2019s just a (indiscernible) point of reference.","Praful Mehta","Yes, got it, that makes sense. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it.","Brian Tierney","Thanks Praful.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Nicholas Akins","Morning Christopher.","Christopher Turnure","Morning, Brian and Nick. I wanted to see if you guys were prepared to clarify the 5 to 7% growth. My understanding is previously it was off a 365 base in 2017 and went through 2019. Is that the same way that we should think about it now?","Brian Tierney","I think we had given detail around that going out even a year farther than that, but we don\u2019t anticipate any change to that in even years beyond that, so we see a runway for that out as far as we can see in our forecasts. We\u2019ve given detail around that out through 2020.","Christopher Turnure","In 2020 at least, could we consider 5 to 7% to be an annual growth rate as opposed to a CAGR off of a previous base?","Brian Tierney","You know, it\u2019s an earnings growth rate, Christopher, so say it\u2019s off 365. As we go forward, we don\u2019t see that changing as \u201916 came in more or less than what we had forecast.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, fair enough. Then there is a lot of jurisdictions here to deal with as it relates to tax reform, and a couple of previous questions have touched on this already, but we have you guys reiterating the 5 to 7% long term rate, we also have a $700 million to $800 million decrease in your forecasted operating cash flow versus EEI, as would be expected here. Is it fair to characterize your assumptions as they relate to tax reform as conservative as they pertain both to the DTL revaluation as well as just the refund considerations to customers themselves?","Brian Tierney","Yes, so let me clarify that a little bit. We do assume that we are going to the lower tax rate from the 35% down to 21%, and that that will be a fairly direct pass-through to our customers in terms of rate since that 35% was baked into our rates and now 21% will be, so we view that as not being an earnings issue. Similarly with the excess ADIT issue - it\u2019s a matter of how do we flow that cash back to our customers and over what period of time. In 1986, it ranged from two years, I think, to 20 years depending on jurisdiction, and I think we\u2019ll have an equally large spread of jurisdictions depending on each jurisdiction\u2019s particular interest, so both of those we have reflected in our numbers, but both of those tend not to be earnings issues, they tend to be, as you were pointing out, cash issues.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, and just on that front, to hit the 5 to 7% growth rate because cash will eventually impact earnings at some point, you don\u2019t need to hit any certain targets in certain jurisdictions to delay that refund or get some kind of reg asset taken off your balance sheet or anything? You feel that you can reach that level with the refunds happening essentially right away?","Brian Tierney","Well again, we did not assume right away, we certainly don\u2019t assume day one flow-backs, and we don\u2019t think that would be a reasonable answer for jurisdictions to ask from us. We\u2019ve built these ADIT balances up over the last 10 or so years, and a flow-back period that is in that time range, we think would be reasonable, or a flow-back that would be associated with the life of an asset would be reasonable. ","Nicholas Akins","It wouldn\u2019t make any sense for the regulatory commissions to ask for all the cash back immediately, because that would impact the credit metrics of each individual entity, and historically it hasn\u2019t been dealt with that way. Back in the 80s when this occurred, it was amortized over time and we would fully expect the same thing this time around. ","Christopher Turnure","Okay, I didn\u2019t necessarily mean just with the deferred tax liability going back on that, just the lower tax rate itself.","Brian Tierney","Yes, so we assume that flows through to customers pretty directly. ","Nicholas Akins","The other thing I just want to reiterate too is that through all this, if there is any question of the 5 to 7% growth rate being in jeopardy in some fashion, that\u2019s just not the case. We\u2019re looking at the 5 to 7% growth rate just like we looked at it before, and luckily--well, not just luckily, but certainly we\u2019re in the enviable position to be able to adjust to tax reform and still confidently talk about our 5 to 7% growth rate. ","Christopher Turnure","Understood, thank you guys.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha","Thank you, good morning.","Nicholas Akins","Morning Ali.","Ali Agha","Nick or Brian, on the Wind Catcher project, there has been some rumblings in the past that maybe a competing transmission line may complicate the overall project. Can you talk to that - is that a concern?","Nicholas Akins","We don\u2019t see that. I mean, other projects will have to stand on their own merits, just like our project. Our project is unique in that it does originate in western Oklahoma high capacity wind, but we also terminate it at where the load is in our territory, and that\u2019s toward Tulsa. I think the other projects have different routings and different assumptions associated with them and congestion associated with them, different assumptions entirely. So there may be opportunities to look at right-of-ways and some element of consistency, but other than that, though, there is really--they\u2019re just different. They\u2019re originating different, the takers are different, and so I would say there\u2019s plenty of wind in Oklahoma, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for development, and there\u2019s plenty of ability to continue to move that process forward. The pie is big enough for more than our particular transaction, so more power to them, but more power to us as well.","Ali Agha","Okay. Also, as you\u2019re looking at the project and assuming it gets approved and everything, is the plan still to own 100% of this or is there a scenario where you could sell down a piece to a third party or reduce that ownership?","Nicholas Akins","No, we intend on owning 100%. ","Ali Agha","I see, okay. More near term, I remember when you laid out your \u201918 guidance for us back at EEI, it was assumed in there a certain amount of rate increases from the various rate cases that had been going on and still going on. Can you just remind us what percentage of that has currently been locked in? ","Brian Tierney","About 50%, Ali.","Ali Agha","Fifty percent - okay. Last question, Brian, just a clarification, so the 5 to 7% growth rate, you are still basing that off an implied 365 number for \u201917, and I heard you say it will go beyond 2020 as well. But again, should we assume that\u2019s kind of an annual growth, or we should again assume it\u2019s cumulative and could move around within years?","Brian Tierney","It\u2019s a growth rate. It will move around within years, but the growth rate is 5 to 7%.","Ali Agha","And off a 365 base for \u201917?","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Ali Agha","Okay, thank you.","Nicholas Akins","Now just keep in mind, as I said earlier, that if we get Wind Catcher and other things that we\u2019ve talked about during EEI Financial, then that can certainly be helpful; but overall, we\u2019re looking at 5 to 7%. We\u2019re within that range and nominally when we look at it, you can look at that range and we\u2019re going to be consistent. That\u2019s what we\u2019re about, that\u2019s what we do.","Ali Agha","Understood, thank you.","Betty Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Last, we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning. Thanks for all the disclosure, it\u2019s been helpful. Most of my questions have been addressed. I guess just stepping back at a high level and thinking about your growth drivers, I do see a couple positives. I guess the rate base CAGR is going up, you\u2019ve had some good results on the pension side as well, and I know you have to raise your debt financing a bit, but that\u2019s certainly an accretive use of money in terms of the rate base CAGR. So I guess I see a few positives - you know, Oklahoma is an unknown and certainly potentially concerning, but I respect your perspective on that. At a very big picture drivers--I guess there is often confusion between cash and GAAP and real earnings power here. I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about high level drivers correctly.","Brian Tierney","Stephen, you\u2019re thinking about it right. When we talk about 5 to 7% growth rate, we\u2019re basing that off an increase in net plant and then getting that reflected in rates, and even at EEI we talked about there being somewhat of a lag associated with the investment we\u2019ve put into place and then having that reflected in rates. That\u2019s least in our transmission business because of the formula-based annual true-ups that they have in the rate base. But really, that 5 to 7% growth rate is based on our continuing to put investment in the ground for the benefit of our customers than getting that reflected in rates, and that has--what we\u2019ve been able to do even with what\u2019s happened with bonus depreciation, with the reduction in the ADIT and the reduction in cash flows, we\u2019ve still been able to keep that investment essentially unchanged. We change at $500 million in the third year of our forecast, but by being able to keep that investment essentially the same, that allows us to stay in that growth range.","Nicholas Akins","I think you have to look at the overall message of AEP has been consistent for years now, but it continues to even be augmented beyond that. This is a very, very solid, financially sound utility that is doing smart things for our customers and working with our jurisdictions, but it\u2019s obviously accentuated by the largest transmission system in the country and the fact that we are making our own version of an adjustment in the fleet itself, and that\u2019s why you have the Wind Catcher and you have other wind power projects, you\u2019re having other transitions occur from a resource standpoint. So the augmentation of that along with what\u2019s going on, on the distribution side - you know, we talked about $500 million of additional incremental investments to be made in distribution on grid modernization that\u2019s not in the plan, these are all things that are changing as time goes on, and when you see the adoption of electric vehicles and all those things that are occurring, there is some important catalysts that we\u2019re seeing in the future that we plan on taking advantage of.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s a great overview. Thanks very much, that\u2019s all I had.","Betty Jo Rozsa","Thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Tawanda, would you please give the replay information? ","Operator","Certainly.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. We're glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our Web site at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. 2014 was an outstanding year for AEP, not just because our earnings came in within the stated guidance range close to the midpoint, which that is great, but the real story is how we did it.","Our management team and employees pulled together a set of firm foundation for the future, the culture that allows for the proper and timely allocation of capital, the ability to take advantage of additional spending opportunities brought on by our first quarter performance, and our focus on disciple and execution by our employees to produce continuous improvement savings to provide the consistency our shareholders and customers expect.","As you probably know by now, Columbus is pretty excited by the Ohio State University football team winning the National Championship this year. They won it because of process, execution, discipline, and leadership that transcended the many pitfalls along the way. AEP is no different in our quest to become a premium regulated utility.","From the outset in 2014, our generation performance during the polar vortex offered an opportunity to advance investment in transmission, detail plans for the movement of O&M expense in the 2014 from 2015 and '16, and build upon the foundation of our continuous improvement initiatives. My point being all of these processes already exist to enable AEP to have the ability to quickly respond with confidence to ultimately improve shareholder value as well as produce value for our customers.","So with that said, reviewing the financials for the quarter and the year, our GAAP and operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share respectively. Our fourth quarter performance was as we expected, given the headwinds of advanced spending, resolution of coal contract issues, and the placement of certain regulatory reserves. The only surprise really was the recent Kentucky decision that knocked us down about $0.05 per share for 2014, which I'll discuss later.","Even after these adjustments, our earnings were $3.34 per share on a GAAP basis, and $3.43 per share on an operating basis for 2014, still within the operating earnings guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share.","We also increased the dividend 6% on an annualized basis, producing a total shareholder return of 35.1% for the year. As you can see, total shareholder return over the one, three, and five year cycles had been impressive. Okay, that's great, but now what about 2015?","AEP is reaffirming our guidance range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share for 2015, with a 4% to 6% earnings growth rate based upon our original 2014 guidance that we shared at the November EEI financial conference. AEP will continue to focus on growth of the regulated businesses, in particular our transmission business focused on effective capital allocation and O&M discipline, and our continuous improvement process redesigned through lean initiatives.","Through our operating company model, constructive regulatory outcomes will be critical through our success, especially in West Virginia and Kentucky, both with major rate case activities this year. Other major areas impacting AEP during 2015 include economic growth in our territory, PJM capacity market reform, the Ohio PPA proposals, the strategic review of our unregulated generation business, and the EPA Clean Power Plant final rule.","So I'll quickly go over some of these issues before moving on to the regulatory matters impacting the equalizer graph on the next page. First, the economy in the AEP territory continues to show a rebound with significant and balanced growth in all three major customer classes. Overall, normalized load for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 3.1% over fourth quarter 2013, excluding Ormet showing solid growth in almost all sectors of the economy. This is great news moving into the new year. Brian will share more specifics regarding load in a few minutes.","We are making excellent progress regarding our continuous improvement initiatives with business functional reviews on schedule, while achieving the targeted savings. Lean deployment is complete in 13 distribution districts, with another 13 districts review planned for 2015, bringing the total to 26 of the 32 districts. We hope to move the others planned for 2016 into 2015, so that we can achieve the full value of these deployments in 2016.","We have also completed initial deployment activities at the nuclear, IT, supply chain, commercial operations, customer and distribution services among others. We have also now completed 10 fossil plants with two others planned to complete during 2015. Transmission has completed the first of five, and the others have also planned to be completed in 2015, so another big year for lean deployment in these and other areas. We're also following up with lean maturity assessment in all of the completed areas starting in 2015 to ensure sustainability of these efforts.","Capacity market reform continues in PJM with filings of proposals for the capacity performance model and supplemental options with FERC. While some changes to these proposals are necessary to improve longer term financial stability as we discussed in our filing in these matters, we are pleased that PJM is pursuing these necessary and important changes. They will improve the balance approach to resources, in particular, ensuring the financial viability and value of base load generating facilities that provide substantial electric system reliability and support.","We're hopeful that FERC will recognize the importance of these reforms to not only stabilize the PJM markets, but also ensure the reliability of the PJM footprint, particularly in the face of impending coal unit retirements in 2015 and beyond. FERC needs to approve these changes expeditiously, so that adjustments could be made to the upcoming PJM capacity options.","Regarding the status of the Ohio purchase power agreement, PPA, pending decisions, we believe that the December special hearing that we held before the PUCO, a strong case was made by AEP and other parties that a legal basis and path exists under Ohio and Federal Law that allows PPAs to be put in place to not only protect customers from volatile capacity and energy markets, but also protect Ohio generation jobs and taxes.","The first shoe [ph] will drop soon with our ESP III case that contains the PPA approach for the OVEC generation capacity followed at some point by the remaining PPAs for the approximately 2700 megawatts of capacity that is most at risk in Ohio. These decisions are critical to the viability of these generating assets, and to Ohio's energy future. The choice is clear for the PUCO, either generation to be maintained in the State as a hedge for customers against significant price swings with the added value of jobs and taxes, tax benefits to Ohio or we can continue to be an importer of power from out-of-state with further negative impacts on Utica shale development and economic development within the State. A positive decision on the ESP III case would at least open the door for a healthy continued dialog regarding the future of Ohio resources.","The EPA's clean power plant continues to gain attention with over 2 million comments filed. AEP filed comments with the EPA not only defining the legal impediments to EPA's tortured position regarding the rules development, but we as well as many other knowledgeable parties made the case that the timing of the 2020 interim target are not achievable, and the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid is at risk if U.S. EPA continues to pursue this much too aggressive path and transform our nation's capacity in energy supply. Without adequate time available for states and those responsible for liability to perform the proper studies before implementation can even begin, we risk a more costly and chaotic path to a cleaner energy economy.","We're pleased that the FERC, NERC and as well as the congress are focused on the reliability issue, and we look forward to participating in FERC's technical conferences that are upcoming this year. Additional warnings have been issued by several of the regional transmission operators, and many of our states are extremely concerned about these proposed rules, and so are we.","Now, regarding the unregulated businesses, as you are all aware, ideal.com article mentioned that we had engaged an investment bank to help us evaluate our alternatives related to the disposition of that business. We acknowledge we had indeed hired the bank as a part of the process we have been discussing with you all for several quarters. As we discussed previously, we are engaged with our Board and are evaluating the strategic alternatives as certain milestones of factual information become known, such as timing for capacity market reforms and auctions, Ohio PPA guidance, and of course the impact of retirement on capacity energy markets. All of these issues represent no regrets actions to enhance generation of value, regardless of the ultimate decision regarding these assets. This analysis continues and remains on track.","So now, moving to the equalizer graph which is the page five of the presentation; obviously strong regulated results, we continue to do several things. First of all, we presented in a different way this time, showed 2014 earned regulate ROEs, and then also showed a pro forma view of 2015. That was done because primarily the ROEs are lower on the left hand side of the page for 2014 because of the advanced spending that occurred, and also does not reflect the revenue that was generated from the unregulated generation side that we used those proceeds to actually do the advanced spending of those -- in those various jurisdictions.","So, as I go through each one of those, for Ohio power, we'll continue to expect to see Ohio power to earn 12% in 2015 in line with the ROE authorized in the most recent seat analysis.","As far as APCo is concerned, as I said last quarter, the combined company amassed a disparity between Virginia and West Virginia ROEs. We're doing fine in Virginia, but as far as West Virginia is concerned, we have a lot of work to do there. There is a case that's been filed for 226 million of which 45 million relates to a vegetation management writer. The earned ROE for West Virginia was approximately 5.8% as filed in the rate case. So hearing has just concluded last week, and we expect an order on that rate case in late May.","As far as Kentucky is concerned, Kentucky has 5.1%. It certainly reflects the supplies we got relative to the order from Kentucky. We had to take a $36 million regulatory provision that was recorded because of the fuel costs disallowance that occurred as it related to Mitchell. We've also filed a rate case at the end of 2014 that reflects about 70 million increase for the full recovery of Mitchell, and we expect that case to be effective in July 2015.","So it was vicarious to us that we line up with a single issue rate making approach associated with the fuel costs issues, and not taking account the broader issues that also will be involved in the rate case. So we're disappointed with that outcome, and certainly there's precedence there that we were banking on in terms of minimum load commitments and those types of things, but we're considering an appeal of that order, but also want to stay engaged with the Kentucky Commission so that we fully understand where they're going and what we need to do to bring about a more positive environment in Kentucky.","So moving on to I&M; I&M is doing very well, 7.9% because of the additional spending that's occurring there, the O&M shifts from the future years. And I&M is well positioned to grow earnings and achieve a 10% ROE. I&M has a great regulatory framework and a lot of major capital investment programs that are in place, and we expect that to continue to improve, and that's why the pro forma side relative to I&M is up towards 10.8%.","PSO continues with fourth quarter 2014 earnings improved over the prior year resulting in an ROE increase of 8.3% to 8.9% for those periods, and really it's because of O&M shifting and how our capital invested on the environmental spend associated with Northeastern units. So we're seeing some pressure there, but PSO is doing fine considering the advanced O&M spending.","As far as SWEPCO is concerned, that issue remains in terms of Turk Arkansas portion of the generation. We're evaluating net debts in regard to that particular aspect of it, but nevertheless SWEPCO has been able to achieve a $14.4 million rate increase in Texas to recover transmission costs and the LPSC also improved -- the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved new rates that will go into effect -- did go into effect first of the year resulting additional 15 million of revenue. So SWEPCO obviously is working where it can, but the larger issue for SWEPCO will be the Turk portion of the generation, which we are developing plans associated with that.","As far as AEP Texas is concerned, AEP Texas, the pro forma returned is coming down primarily because of a significant drop in increased CapEx, lower earnings, and the need to infuse equity associated with the securitization. So -- but they're filing a T-cost filing that was made in December with an approval expected in February 2015, and then also looking at the distribution filing as well. So, work in progress relative to AEP Texas.","The Transco continues to do well. Those returns are still at the 11.5%, and look back at 11.2% for 2015. We continue to add additional plant and service, 837 million. The plant and service were added in 2014; and for ETT and other, 54 million of plant and service. So we continue to invest heavily in the transmission business, and those returns are what we expected. So overall the returns for the pro forma adjusted ROE is at 9.6% for 2015, which is slightly above I think, we had 9.5% in the EEI financial case. So it's slightly above that. But as you see the advanced spending of '15 and '16 roll off and as well the additional rate case activity that's occurring, we should see improvement during 2015.","So, obviously I think it's been a great year because of the way we positioned the business, and as I said earlier, last quarter 2015 will be an interesting year, but one that no doubt why we're excited about and will set the tone for redefining AEP's future.","So, now over to Brian.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. On Slide 6 you will see our comparison of 2014 operating results to 2013 by segment, for both the quarter and the year-to-date period. I'll focus my remarks primarily on the total year results. You can find the details for the quarterly results in the appendix.","Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $232 million or $0.48 per share compared to $0.60 per share or $296 million last year. These results when combined with the results through September pushed our year-to-date operating earnings to $1.7 billion or $3.43 per share compared to $3.23 per share or $1.6 billion in 2013.","Despite mild temperatures during this past summer, our 2014 results were strong compared to last year, driven by the weather-related sales and strong operations last winter. Our execution during this extreme periods produced sufficient margin for us to advance O&M spending from future years as well as to raise our 2014 midpoint target by $0.15 per share. Finally, we continue to deliver on our transmission targets, as Nick said, exceeding our 2014 forecast for the Transmission Holdco segment by $0.02 per share.","With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segments for the year on Slide 7. 2014 earnings for the vertically integrated utility segment were $1.45 per share down $0.07 from last year. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes and strong off-system sales margins offset by higher non-fuel operating costs.","Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.20 per share for the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers. Partially offsetting this result were regulatory provisions of $0.04 per share in APCo Virginia and $0.05 per share for the Kentucky fuel order.","Increases in off-system sales benefited shareholders and customers. The higher margins improved earnings for this segment by $0.16 per share, while customers across several of our jurisdictions realized a $129 million through margin sharing mechanisms. This was driven by strong performance during last winter's polar vortex.","O&M expense was higher than last year which lowered results for the segment by $0.28 per share. The higher O&M was due in part to plan incremental spending including shipping work in future years primarily in our generation wires functions. In addition, O&M was impacted by an increase in employee-related costs and the effects of certain credits recorded in 2013.","Depreciation expense is also higher due to increased capital investment. This increased expense lowered earnings by $0.09 per share. To a lesser degree, weather and normalized load favorably affected the comparison by $0.02 and $0.01 per share respectively. Colder than normal temperatures were experienced most of this year, benefiting sales at the beginning and end of the year, but adversely affecting sales during the summer months.","The transmission and distribution utility segments earned $0.72 per share for the year, $0.01 below 2013 results. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of third-party transmission revenue and normalized load growth offset by higher operating costs.","Higher third-party transmission revenues added $0.09 per share, resulting from increased transmission investments, increased revenues from customers who have switched to alternative suppliers in Ohio, and favorable rate adjustments in the PJM and ERCOT regions. Normalized load was strong in both Texas and Ohio, improving results by $0.06 per share. I'll talk more about Load and economy in a few minutes.","Similar to the vertically integrated segments, O&M expense was higher than last year. This lowered the results for this segment by $0.05 per share. The higher expense was due in part to planned incremental spending, including shifting work from future years. In addition, O&M was impacted by an increase in employee-related costs.","Depreciation expense was higher for the year due to increased capital investment lowering earnings by $0.04 per share. Certain tax items adversely affected the annual comparison by $0.04 per share due to higher property, State, and Federal income taxes. Rate changes and regulatory provisions netted together were unfavorably by $0.01 per share in the annual comparison. Finally, other items affected the comparison by $0.02 per share.","The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.31 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.15, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment's plan grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 68%.","The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.84 per share adding $0.14 per share to the annual comparison. Gross margin improved more significantly early in the year due to the strong performance of the generation fleet and commercial organization during the polar vortex. ","The results in 2014 also benefited from lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. These included maintenance costs as well as severance and retirement obligations related to unit retirements in 2015.","AEP river operations contributed $0.10 per share in 2014, $0.08 per share more than 2013, due to improvements in barge freight demand for much of the year.","Corporate and other earnings were down $0.09 per share from last year. The 2013 results included the interest income benefit recorded in 2013 associated with the resolution of the U.K. windfall tax issue.","In summary, we took advantage of extreme weather conditions, performed well operationally; we were able to get a jump on future spending requirements, and achieved earnings within our raised guidance range; all in all, a successful year financially.","Let's take a look at Slide 8 where we can review the normalized load trends for the quarter. By now, you should be familiar with the layout of these charts and how we show the growth with and without Ormet which seized operations in the fourth quarter of 2013.","My remarks will reflect the exclusion of Ormet, unless otherwise noted to give you a sense of how our service portfolio is recovering on an ongoing basis.","Starting in the lower right corner, you can see that overall weather normalized load was up 3.1% for the quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter with positive normalized load growth. I would also like to point out that the 2.2% growth for the year was the largest annual increase in retail sales since 2010.","In the lower left quadrant, you see that our industrial sales volumes were up 3.9% for both the quarter and the year-to-date. We continue to see the strongest industrial sales growth from customers in our oil and gas related sectors which I'll cover in more detail later in the presentation.","In 2014, nine of our top 10 industrial sectors experienced compared to last year. The lone exception for the year was mining which was down 3%. For the quarter the sector leaders were pipeline transportation up 61% oil and gas extraction up 11% and primary metals our largest sector which experienced 5% growth for the quarter excluding Ormet.","On the upper right of the slide, you can see the commercial sales were up 3.5% for the quarter and were positive for the year for the first time since 2008. We saw the strongest commercial sales growth this quarter in Texas where customer accounts increased by 1.8%. For comparison the AEP systems are commercial customer growth are five tenth of a percent.","Finally, in the upper left corner you can see the residential sales were down 2.1% for the quarter and end of the year up 1.1%. While we continue to see steady growth in residential customer accounts in the west both for the residential growth is related to higher customer usage which is consistent with the improving economy in AEP service territory. I should point out that both for the quarter and year we saw the strongest growth in residential and commercial sales in the P&D utility segment where we collect only the wires component due to the unbundled rate structure. In the vertically integrated utility segment where we collect the full bundle grade we actually saw a decline in residential and commercial sales.","With that, let's review the most recent economic data for AEP service territory on Slide 9. Starting with GDP you can see that the estimated 2.6% growth for the US economy in the fourth quarter is higher than the 1.7% growth in AEPs aggregate service territory. However in the upper right corner you see that the economy in our western service territory grew by 2.5% in the fourth quarter which nearly matched the US and outpaced our eastern footprint.","In the bottom left quadrant you can see the job growth within AEP service territory continues to improve in step with the U.S. employment recovery. Job growth in AEPs western territories exceeded both the US and AEPs eastern service areas. Within AEPs territory we saw the strongest growth in the quarter in the following sectors, natural resources and mining, construction, leisure and hospitality and manufacturing.","Now let's turn to Slide 10 to update you on the impact the domestic Shale gas activity is having on AEPs industrial growth. As we've said before we are seeing significant load increases in the part of our service territories that are located in and around major Shale formations.","For the quarter, industrial sales in the shale counties were up 23% compared to seven tenth of a percent decline in non-shale counties. For the year we saw a 30% growth in our Shale counties compared to 2013. This Shale region growth activity is significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in Shale gas counties."," The bottom of the chart highlights our industrial sales growth by major Shale region. As you can see for the quarter we saw a growth in all five Shale areas with the strongest growth around the Marcellus, Woodford and Utica regions.","Finally, we know that the recent decline in the oil prices is sustained will be strong in the headwind in the oil and gas sector in 2015. Fortunately AEP has a diversified industrial base within a service territory to insulate it from down turns in one specific industry. For example, transportation and auto manufacturing would likely benefit from lower fuel prices.","This is another example of how AEPs balanced portfolio of utilities provides not only geographical diversification for exposure to weather but also a diversified regional economy to provide steady growth under various economic conditions.","Turning to Slide 11, let's review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total cap remains healthy at 54.4%. A credit metrics FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt have improved from last quarter and are solidly in the triple B and BAA1 range at 5.4 times and 21.8% respectively.","Our qualified pension funding decreased 2% from last year and now stands at 97% funded. The reduction in the funded position was a result of an increase in planned liabilities driven by a 70 basis point decrease in the discount rate in the adoption of the new mortality table, which was anticipated. An increase in the planned assets tempered the impact of the liability growth during the year.","For 2014, our pension funding was $71 million, and we expect to make a contribution of $87 minimum in 2015. O&M expense associated with our pension was $103 million in 2014, and is expected to be about $84 million in 2015. Since our Op '10 [ph] funding is at 118%, no funding was required in 2014 and none will be needed in 2015.","Finally, our liquidity stands at nearly $3 billion, and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the fourth quarter of last year, our treasury group posted with our banking partners to amend and expand those key facilities. In doing so, we were able to modify the facilities in such a way that the bank's capital requirements would be reduced, while at the same time, providing a benefit to AEP by expanding the tenure and taking advantage of improved pricing.","We worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on the slide, and we believe we're well positioned for the future.","Turning to Slide 12, I'll try to wrap this thing up, I know that 2014 is now ancient history, so let me close by providing an update for 2015. We're reaffirming the guidance range, as Nick said that we provided to EEI last November of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Here are some of the drivers you should think about that impacted the guidance range. We have a positive track record in putting capital to work for the benefit of our customers and then earning a return on that investment are efficiently getting it into rates. This year should continue that trend with expected rate changes of approximately $200 million, similar to last year.","We are encouraged by the recent experience in our residential, commercial, and industrial classes. And we expect the modest load increase this year of 6.10% [ph].","Our continued investment in transmission infrastructure should provide approximately $0.07 per share growth, and we will look for opportunities to employ additional capital in that area just as we've done in the last couple of years. We're maintaining the discipline around operations and maintenance expenses, and because of our cost reduction initiatives as well as the cost we shipped into 2014, O&M should be a positive driver for 2015.","In regards to the challenges we face for 2015, I think you're well aware of them; from the earnings shortfall from the PJM capacity pricing and the retail stability rider, the lower natural gas prices and power prices and their impact on our system sales. The capacity in RSR issues have been known for some time, and it is still very early in the year to make any changes based on current energy prices. At this point of the year, we're still comfortably within the previously announced range. In summary, the company is financially strong, and we're well in our way to meeting our stated goals.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers","Hi, good morning, guys.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers","Hey, guys. I know there is going to be a lot of Ohio questions in a minute, so I wanted to hit a couple of others, first. On the transmission business, with the -- if you read IPO out in the market, how are you guys thinking about the future of your transmission business, given the size and the growth potential there, and respectively other key performance of funding for the business?","Nick Akins","Yes, we continue to look at our transmission business as part and parcel to AEP. I mean we obviously have a lot of scope and scale there, but really we continue to find it on a continual basis, and it's important for us to be in a position to be able to grow that business. And really to go to these other structures, there are complications from a state regulatory standpoint and tax hearing standpoint. So at this point I think we're going to continue pursuing transmission in the vein that we have been.","Dan Eggers","One of the successes of the transmission issue was you guys kept finding more capital to put into that business. How are you thinking about investment as a baseline for 2015, and what do you think would cause that number to come up as the year progresses?","Nick Akins","Yes, so during the year we continually reallocated capital from other business units as part of the business that we are in. One of the process is the great processes we have in place with the capital allocation program and the continual process for reallocation of capital enables us to move more to the transmission side and advance some of that green area that I keep talking about on the graph of additional transmission span that we have available. If we get ahead in some fashion, you never know what the summer will look like, but we'll certainly look for continued ways to improve and put that capital work in the transmission area.","Dan Eggers","You guys did a nice job detailing all the earned ROE expectations for the utilities by utility. In aggregate, with this 9.6% earned ROE, should we assume this kind of a normalized earned ROE for you guys? You guys now -- be between cases in different jurisdiction, so not a reason to be optimized the same time as the -- have we seen any improvement in ROEs that we should expect to see after this year?","Nick Akins","Yes, I think you can see the stack that we have for regulatory is relatively small compared to previous years as we continue to invest in the regulated businesses. You're going to continue to see sort of a ten-ish, around 10% type of ROE. So we expect as we continue to make progress, we have invested heavily in transmission, and some of that transmission is also included in the operating companies. And you also have additional distribution spending going on. So we'll continue to make advancements, and cases will become probably much more frequent and less in terms of what the ask is so that we can take advantage of writers and things like that to get more concurrent recovery.","So as we progress in that regard, you'll see things like -- and I&M is a perfect example where not only legislative, but from a regulatory stand point we've been able to get pretty substantial capital expense with a timely response in terms of recovery. We have that there transmission. Certainly, we're doing well from Ohio perspective, from a transmission distribution perspective. So those are the kinds of things we'll continue to advance in the other jurisdictions as well.","Dan Eggers","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies.","Q \u2013 Anthony Crowdell","Hey, good morning Nick, no offense taking -- you mentioned the All Star game this weekend. With the reference to the offering, I'm no sure, if you would add, but the question I have relates to -- you mentioned earlier about the strategic view of the generating assets, and then also maybe obtaining an Ohio PPA, I mean, how would the company approach it if basically the grounds from the Ohio PPA was that AEP had to retain all the generating assets in Ohio?","Nick Akins","Yes, so obviously I mean we don't want to talk too much about that because you don't know where things are going to go in this case, but it's our position that it's really no regret strategy for Ohio, given there really shouldn't be a requirement that we continue to own the asset, because what this is really about is reinforcing the value of those resources that they continue to run in Ohio.","Now, obviously it's a good thing to have PPA that support contracts and support generating units, and that would be a positive aspect if this says, \"Okay, there is continued consistency in terms of recovery around the cost related to these assets,\" and that would be a good thing. So we're going to just have those kinds of discussions, but obviously as we pursue it we want to see that we have the ability to do whatever we decide to do from a business standpoint, but make sure that those assets are standing there for our Ohio customers though. We'll just have to see where that goes.","Q \u2013 Anthony Crowdell","Great, thank you very much.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Can you hear me?","Nick Akins","Oh, yes, good morning. How're you doing?","Q \u2013 Paul Patterson","All right, just on the O&M shift, I apologize if I missed this; from 2015 to 2014, how much of that quantifiable -- I apologize if you -- I mean I was loosening, I just don't know if I missed it. How much of that was put in 2014 that's going to be coming out in 2015 and 2016?","Nick Akins","Yes, about 60 million was moved forward from '15 and '16 into '14.","Q \u2013 Paul Patterson","Okay, great. And then with respect to the AEP merchant operation I guess obviously there are a lot of moving pieces, and I can appreciate that. But I'm just wondering, what are the chances that you guys could retain this business? How should we think about this?","Nick Akins","Obviously, we're going to have to go through the evaluation processes to determine exactly what we do. But our going in position is we're regulated utility. And \u2013 and the two things that we're trying to get out of this process was to make sure that we took volatility out of that out of the unregulated business. And we're able to make long-term investments.","Now, that's relatively a hard hurdle. But nevertheless we have to go through the process of understanding the capacity market reform, what happens to PPA as to solidify those assets, what happens to energy markets when the other coal units around 5700 Megawatt of coal fire generation gets retired here in May. And then sort of two other things going on and that is these [pieced up] metal auctions that are occurring and if FERC approves the capacity performance model and have these other auctions, those maybe considerable value propositions that we're going to have to know and understand.","So I said the first issue was going to drop around the ESP III filing and be up to the commission when they actually render an order on the follow up to that, which is for the larger piece of assets and that's around 2700 megawatts. So it's going to be depended upon the timing and our understanding of the value proposition associated with that business. And I think you said that correct earlier. There are a lot of moving parts here. But they are parts that are starting to come together in 2015.","Q \u2013 Paul Patterson","Okay. So it is safe to say sort of that if you don't do out of priority it's going to be above the merchant operations due to let's say ESP not working out as planned or whatever, would it be less likely that you guys would end up retaining the asset? Does that make sense?","Nick Akins","Yes, that makes sense.","Q \u2013 Paul Patterson ","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Hugh Wynn with Stanford Bernstein.","Nick Akins","Hi, Hugh.","Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn","Hi, first one on Slide 7. You've explained how some of the 2015-16 O&M expansions were brought forward. There is another factored key that I wanted you to shed some light on. The biggest contributors to higher earnings this year were I think the -- among the biggest contributors were the OSF, $0.16 and AGR, $0.11 you also got a nice added benefit from the AP river operations and some significant portion of that on the OSF and AGR obviously reflected Q1 weather and market conditions. I imagine the AEP river operations reflected to some extend very benign growing condition and record corn harvest. My question is how should I think about 2014 away from the impact that weather had on generation and shipping volume to AEP River?","Nick Akins","Yes, I think one thing is load obviously was increased during that period of time. And then there was an enabling factor here where with load with obviously with the unregulated generation was able to do relative to margins. We were able to take advantage of that, and certainly, offload some of the '15 and '16 impacts. But I'd say the year when you look at the foundational issues that we have from the regulatory recovery to the -- to what the service territory looks like it's doing in terms of load increases and the makeup of that load is probably very -- I mean that would be very good for us from a foundational perspective going forward. I think you all look at 2014 as a very successful year ended that we took advantage of the upside that existed because of frankly the polar vortex and how we performed with our units and also being able to give some of the regulatory actions in place, so I'd say 2014 was -- if you took out -- if you adjusted out the you know what we're made in off-system sales relative to the polar vortex, then we probably would not have taken some of the steps that we took and still would've managed the year in a very positive way.","Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn","So with that, basically you're suggesting I think that we should be looking at 14 as have reflected off the line earnings power given the frontloading of the O&M offsetting the Q1?","Nick Akins","That's right I think 2014 turned out to be a major positional year for us because we took advantage of some of the things that occurred during the year and that's really as I said earlier that's the true story of not only 2014 but the last quarter. We took advantage of the upside that occurred during the year but we didn't do it you know just by doing additional things we did it by managing our \u2026 managing the future in terms of the earnings power of the Company as well. So you know that's really the story of the year.","Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn","That relate that question on 8\/10 [ph], I assume nonetheless that the -- correct me if I'm wrong here, the relatively low growth that you're anticipating and residential normalized sales and commercial normalized sales despite accelerating GDP growth and improving employment and consumer confidence and all those good things. Still reflects you know some element of the first quarter strength that you feel was probably not going to be repeated even in this normalized basis so in other words you're working off of a very high base and its going to be harder replicate equivalent levels of growth in the coming year.","Nick Akins","I think that's the last comment you made kind of hits a nail in the head, because our growth was so strong in 2014 we don't think it will be as strong as we go into 2015 and that's why you see the numbers for the estimates reflected on slide 8 that you do.","Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn","Okay, and what\u2026","Brian Tierney","And you got to keep in mind too I mean we do the best job we can in terms of anticipating what load forecast looks like but in this economy and with what's going on particularly when you're on the -- where its adjusting considerably as we go along we tend to be a pretty conservative branch. And it's done that way because \u2026 because it's sort of a foreseeing function for the rest of the business to compensate for what we could have is \u2026 is you know very low load growth depending on what happens to the world economy oil and gas prices. We just have to see some consistency in all this has to be really positive to make further adjustments in the future and that's going to play itself out.","Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn","Now that conservatism on a load forecast and the calculation of adjustment range is much appreciated; just one last thing, what -- have you guys disclosed any expectations regarding the pace of O&M growth off of the 2014 base?","Nick Akins","Yeah, we -- we thank you it will be flat to slightly positive when you look at the utility segment net or earnings offset at about $3.1 billion in O&M. we anticipate that to be perhaps closer to about $3 billion in 2015. So we do expect some uptick in O&M and that's as a result to some of the things that we talked about, pulling some of those expenses and work associated with those expenses forward in the 2014 through 2015 and 2016.","Brian Tierney","The fascinating part about all of that is that we continue to absorb additional increases in O&M you know for labor costs, for certainly for cyber security, physical security all those things that are occurring in addition so it's \u2026 its more than just you know keeping that flat. It's really absorbing substantial changes.","Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn","Got it, thank you.","Operator","We will go next from the line of Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Yeah, good morning guys.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Firstly I wanted to ask on the comment you made about residential sales being primarily up on usage rather than customer count in the west, are you seeing a some kind of a softening in the efficiency angle or can you just give us a little bit more color on your confidence in the source of that growth and the -- as if likely trajectory?","Brian Tierney","Yeah, Jonathan this is Brian. In some of the parts particularly T&D utilities where we're seeing a lot of Shale industrial growth is where we've seen a lot of the average usage growth go up. And in places that aren't impacted by that we've actually seen a decline in average customer usage. So if as utilities we look at for industrial the lead commercial and residential growth that's very much been the case in the places where we see the Shale developments.","I guess looking forward in terms of energy efficiency I think a lot of the energy efficiency to date in the states where we have energy efficiency initiatives have been focused more on the residential class and we anticipate some of that low-hanging fruit gets taken, some of that would start shifting with the commercial class and we'll start to see some impacts there as well. But that's sort of a \u2026 the color I'd give you on where we're seeing the load growth and why.","Nick Akins","Brian alluded to this earlier and that is the shift its occurring if we see the oil and gas impacts relative to Shale gas activity well you still have gasoline and basic energy prices that are reducing that so that would have an effect of improving the residential and commercial side as well, so because this part of the economy obviously the benefit from more disposable income so it would be interesting to see as the year goes on how this develops. We're just out the beginning of you know being in wash and shale gas and that kind of thing. But with gasoline prices lower it may enable people to start purchasing more homes and those types of things that move the economy.","Jonathan Arnold","Great thanks and so you've kind of see trend 2015 sales outlook by 30 basis points, is that -- and you've talked about other parts of the economy offsetting shale, can you -- how much of the -- is the kind of Shale slowdown is seem to be versus what you were expecting?","Nick Akins","Jonathan, when you look at -- when you say we've trimmed it by 30 basis points it's really adjusting the base that we're operating off of. So it's the higher base in 2014 that really accounted for the reduction in 2015 on a year-over-year basis. Does that make sense?","Jonathan Arnold","Yeah. If my memory serves, you did that last year too\u2026 ","Nick Akins","Yeah, that happens.","Jonathan Arnold","Anything happens. Great. Could I just ask one other thing -- on this EEI slides I think you said you said you had 80% of generation gross margin, you know locked in some form of a contract or hedging. Is there an update to that number? And I guess you know maybe that hedges would be a bigger percentage of a smaller number so maybe adjusting for any change in the overall outlook.","Nick Akins","Yeah., John, we don't like to give obviously a specific number but when you think about what we try and have hedged we try and be in that 60% to 70% hedged range. And I think that would be a fair assumption looking forward as well. He worries about comparative information so\u2026","Jonathan Arnold","Right, right.","Nick Akins","But that's a general rule of thumb that he is \u2026","Jonathan Arnold","But having said you did say you were at 80 in November. Yes, okay they're not -- you're not saying that's changed \u2026 are you Brian when you say 60 to 70?","Brian Tierney","No, I'm not -- there's no change. When we talk about the range we like to be hedging and -- you also need to think about whether its volume or margins. ","Jonathan Arnold","Right.","Brian Tierney","So I think the margin that you're referencing is higher in terms of volume it would be lower amount.","Jonathan Arnold","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you we'll go next to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Nick Akins","Hello Paul. How're you.","Paul Ridzon","Just fine. Goes back to Hugh's question about Memco, was 2014 a good year or 2013 a poor year?","Brian Tierney","Hi, Paul. It's a combination of both. But 2014 was a good year primarily we're starting to see earnings capability from the tanker barges. You know we also had a good grain season that continues. But at the tanker -- our entry into the tanker barge business has been successful.","Paul Ridzon","But I think Nick's initial statement hit the nail on the head; '13 was not a good year and '14 was a good year.","Brian Tierney","So, '15 may be split the difference. We like to see it continue like '14 was and as Nick said we're getting higher margins from some of the tanker barges that we have. And we anticipate that we'll continue to grow that part of the business where we get the higher margin.","Paul Ridzon","And then on transmission, I think you finished the year $0.02 ahead of plan. Should we assume that '15 can -- that carries you can finish $0.02 ahead of '15's plan?","Brian Tierney","Yes, we're thinking that the transmission side will improve 14 as a result by about $0.07 per share.","Paul Ridzon","That kind of put you on top of where your EEI lies at, $0.38?","Brian Tierney","That's about right.","Nick Akins","Yes, that's right.","Paul Ridzon","Okay, thank you very much.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Just making sure I understand on the merchant thinking in your part as you dealt that number of data points coming up. But if I hear them and the timing of all of those looks like by middle of this year, you should be in a position to strategically decide your next step. Is that a fair when you think about it?","Nick Akins","I think as it now stands, you're going to have a lot of that information by mid-year. Now, it remains be seen what the commission does strategically that probably utility commission of Ohio relative to the second increment the 2700 megawatts generation if that to occur before May or after May I don't know at this point. And then what FERC does with the supplemental options, if you have supplemental options particularly that add tremendous value proposition form the existing auction period like the '16 and '17 auctions. There could be a supplemental auction associated with that, and then others as well. Then we are going to have to fully understand what that means. I'm sure if there is a transaction -- any transaction party would want to understand that too. So as a general thought process, we're thinking of lot of the information coming to play in '15. We're hopeful that a lot of that comes into play in mid-15. But we'll have to see where that goes.","Ali Agha","Yes, and conceptually on the part as you thought about actually exiting the business. You looked at two parts; actual sale monetization raising cash re-investment in that and then spin-offs where you save some of the tax leakage. As you got more data, you've gone down the part any clarity or preferences between those parts?","Nick Akins","No, not yet. There are some big opponents sitting out there that we have to fully understand. Obviously be great to take precedes and re-invest in the business, particularly in transmission. But each one of those options that you mentioned has its pros and cons. We need to make sure we have all these major factual items to make a sound decision. ","Ali Agha","Generally, you do believe that its capital still out there, you will be back this big PJM-related transaction if that have happened recently that's still capital availability out there that is willing to spend more money in that region?","Nick Akins","Yes, I do. I think there is. And obviously some of the latest information on market power concerns and those kinds of things will -- it really depends on who the other parties are. So, we'll have to -- that's another issue that we'll have to fully understand. I do believe that is out there.","Ali Agha","Okay. And in the past when you guys have talked about your merchant sensitivities and exposures you related there to power prices, dollar change equations to certain earnings per share. But is there sensitivity on the fuel side as well? In other word, oil prices obviously have come down so have coal prices. So should we think more along the dark spread side of the equation or is the sensitivity all still on the power side on the merchant part?","Nick Akins","Yes, I think obviously capacity prices has the big part of the value proposition for those assets and as far as the energy market is concerned, you'd have to look at the energy market and say, \"Okay, what's the margin expectation from that part of the business?\" So margins are a little bit depressed in this market, but not too depressed, and really -- like I said earlier, it really depends upon someone else's view what the forward curve looks like. So there will obviously be discussions about long-term forward curve and what it looks like for energy process, but the real definition around this will be provided in the capacity side.","Ali Agha","Understood, thank you.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Akins","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides","Hey, Nick. Hey, Brian. When I look at the equalizer slide, it's the slide you show on earned ROEs across various segments. Can you just walk us through -- I know you've got the Kentucky rate case outstanding, and now it will have a big impact, but can you walk us through a little bit about what you think will improve things so much at both the I&M and SWEPCO? I mean the SWEPCO $50 million increases are relatively small number in the size and scale of SWEPCO; just kind of how do you get such a big uplift when you look at pro forma versus earned in 2014?","Brian Tierney","Yes. Let me give you some quick insight on the I&M. So obviously they have some plans that are going to retire next year. So what we did in 2014 was look forward at what some of the severance and additional retirement obligations were going to be, and because when you could quantify those and have some real clarity into what those would look like we were able to take those charges in 2014 and won't be realizing those in '15. So '14's results were weighted down by our estimating and calculating those results we take them in 2014, and obviously not having similar results in 2015 in I&M will help us to improve those results there.","Nick Akins","And then for SWEPCO, it's going to be -- we're not going to define an Arkansas solution here, because we got the formal rate changes in Louisiana, really taking into account the Valley district, it was required there, and then in Texas we do have full recovery for Turk, but also the transmission, T-cost filings and so forth have been positive. So those two jurisdictions are working very well. Arkansas is a work in progress, because we're not only -- we're now investing in Scrubber applications, environmental expense at Welsh and Flint Creek power plants. And that's somewhat of a drag, but we've got to get through in some kind of ability to get through either Turk or some rate case support for Arkansas.","So, now, Arkansas' returns other than if you exclude Turk are generally okay, but whether it takes an account the risk associated with Turk is another issue, and we've got to find a mechanism to get more value for that previous Arkansas portion of Turk; the 88 megawatts.","Michael Lapides","And you think until that solved?","Nick Akins","Until that solved, you'll continue to see SWEPCO somewhat depressed.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And you think you can get some change in Arkansas done in 2015 to drive that 150 basis points or so increase in ROE?","Nick Akins","You're talking about above the 8.3%\u2026","Michael Lapides","Just to go from 6.8 to 8.3.","Nick Akins","No. Yes.

Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Earnings Webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks, Chuck, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on AEP's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. It has been a great quarter for us, I think. From an overall viewpoint, AEP has done very well in terms of financial performance. ","We delivered GAAP ongoing earnings of $0.80 a share, which is positive, given some significant headwinds of the mild weather, low natural gas prices impacts on all systems sales and the Ohio customer switch. The story demonstrates the value of the diversity of AEP's service footprint and our ability to control costs to respond to these headwinds. ","Industrials continue to improve, while commercial and residential still struggle. I think it's an indication of the economy and how much of an issue it is with the recovery of the economy at this point in time. And I think as we progress, though, there's some fundamentals within AEP's service territory, primary metals and oil and gas activity, that are contributing to positive success for our territories. ","With that said, we can't reaffirm guidance because of the significant area of risk involving the Ohio situation and the transition to competition, which I'll discuss in more detail a little bit later. ","With the Ohio risk, we're still committed to our long-term strategy we've set out for you on February 10 namely: Movement to competitive environment, we will continue to move to that competitive environment in Ohio. We're embracing it. We support it with the corporate separation that goes along with it and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and marketing functions. ","Our investment, our regulated businesses, obviously, will continue as well. Our focus on the growth aspects and repositioning of the company around transmission and other growth areas will be significant. The dividend strength is still provided and secured by the regulated businesses. And we have a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate that we've discussed in February 10. ","The transformation or our generation resources, in response to the market and EPA mandates, is going to be an opportunity for us because we will deploy capital to do that, and we've seen the latest EPA rules, and Mark McCullough and our generation area certainly has worked out a capital path that makes sense for us going forward. ","So we have made progress in the first quarter on several fronts. On March 7, we issued $800 million of TCC transition funding bonds, an attractive average interest rate of 2.28%, which compared favorably to similar recently priced deals. Proceeds of the bond issue were used to fund the capital program, reduce TCC debt and contribute to the pension, which is now 90% funded. ","On March 8, we completed the acquisition of BlueStar Energy, the retail organization based in Chicago that participates in deregulated retail markets and provides energy services such as DSM type activities. Integration of BlueStar with AEP retail is progressing very well and is on schedule, and we now have over 100,000 customers and growing quickly in that area. ","I'm pleased with the progress in our reposition of the transmission business. Earnings from transmission continue to improve, and with the recently announced Transource JV with Kansas City Power & Light, Great Plains Energy, and our continued formation with Transco's in our service territory, we continue to deliver more near-term projects to achieve the critical mass for future growth. ","Transource is an addition to the capital plan. We believe that it was a great project for us. It shows that critical mass in near-term on the joint venture, although there's not much spend in the first 2 years. It really does pick up in '14, '15, '16. So that graph that we provided for you back in February that had sort of a dampened look toward the later years, as we represented, was really based upon firm, known projects with little risk, and we wanted to show it that way. And now, with the addition of Transource, you're going to see that portion of it sort of kick up in those later years that is shown in that graph. ","So that's important for us to start that critical mass and see that transmission investment continue to grow. The reason why we did the Transource deal was to pursue competitive transmission development projects in the advent of Order 1,000  for -- certainly wanted to set the tone for a comparative transmission going forward, and it was important for us to really put together an engine for that future growth. ","And we saw, certainly, from the Great Plains perspective, a near-term project that could provide an ability for us to put that critical mass in place and really give us an advantage going forward in the marketplace in the competitive access area. And it also is on the interface of MISO and SPP, so that provides some future prospects for us. And as well, it focuses on other state footprints like Missouri and Kansas. ","So overall, it was a very good thing. Great Plains is a great partner for us and one that we're happy to have involved with the transmission business with us. ","Our generation transformation activities continue into the market in EPA rules. We now have 4,600 megawatts that'll be retired over a time period, really detailed by the EPA rules end of 2014. But that could change based upon the extension years and also could change because of the markets. So we're staying pretty flexible when the retirements would actually occur based upon a resolution of some of those issues. ","But the 4,600 megawatts is a little different than the 6,000 megawatts we had mentioned to you previously at the time of the February 10 deal that we had 6,000 megawatts. If you take out 4 and 5, which we've already retired, and then the Big Sandy activity, that gets you in the 4,600-megawatt number. ","So -- but the current view is, is that, from a capital standpoint, there's a capital plan worked out, even with the aggressive EPA schedule. And certainly, we want to be able to mitigate costs to our customers as much as we can during this process. So we continue to be active on coming up with legislation that provides for more of a blanket extension of time to really give customers time to make that adjustment. ","And for us, when we retire these plants, the communities involved, the taxes involved, the socio-economic factors involved need to be dealt with in a very positive fashion. And by replacing generation, by coming up with other alternatives, these communities can adjust to that. And I think that's important for us as we deal with an economy that is where it is today. ","Turk construction is now 90% complete. We're moving along very well in that prospect, getting Turk done by the end of the year. And rate cases are being prepared to support that investment as well. ","So I have to admit, while I've been pleased with the progress of transmission, generation and many of our regulated operating company activities, our time has been spent here in the first quarter and before personally consumed by the ongoing events in Ohio, as we move to a competitive environment. ","I'm sure all of you have followed this closely. And I can't talk too much about what's going on because of the ongoing hearings in the capacity case, but without regurgitating the history of the capacity and ESP cases in Ohio, I'll give you my take on the subject. ","This is a case where AEP is asking for what other utilities in Ohio have been previously granted, a fair and reasonable transition to competition that maintains the ability for competitors to compete, but maintains the financial integrity of AEP while we unwind some of the commitments that have been made, specifically contracts with PJM for support of FRR-related capacity for our customers and the eastern pool agreement. The agreement that takes the transfer of capacity and energy among the companies in the eastern footprint. ","We need time to unwind those type of arrangements. And those commitments have been made previously with the concurrence of the commission, and certainly, we'd like to unwind those in a very rational way. ","The ESP plan that we filed on March 30 balances the interest of what we believe are the 3 main interests of the commission. We tried to be responsive to the concerns related to the previous stipulation and provide a clear path to competition with basically a hybrid of the approach of the stipulation, but adjusted with more Duke-like characteristics, such as energy-only options, leading to an earlier, about 6 months, full option and a transition charge to the retail stability rider. So our plan is balanced in these 3 areas, and I'll call it the 3 C's: Customers, competition and the company. ","Customer rates have been adjusted to mitigate the concerns of the low-load factor customers with a more moderate application of the rate increases over all classes of customers. And discounted capacity rates have been put in place that allows for competitors to successfully compete. We've shown that customers are indeed switching at the proposed $255 per megawatt day rate. And the company's financial integrity is maintained through the transition period, tied to a utility rate of return that puts us back into position basically at the December stipulation. ","So if you visualize a triangle with these 3 areas in each corner, there is a balance. And if you move capacity rates down, you're only lining the pockets of the competitor suppliers at either the customer's expense or the company's expense. And if it's at the customers' expense, the retail stability rider has to increase, causing higher increases in customer rates, and that's probably not a good outcome. And if it's at the company's expense, it's tantamount to taking capacity value that the company is committed for a 3-year period to PJM to run and giving it to competitors to subsidize the acquisition of our customers, which sort of seems a little bit un-American to me. It's really not competition, it's more a confiscation. ","So there is a balance that has been struck with this plan that I would hope the PUC will support. I know there has been much discussion about AEP's legal options, but I would much rather see this case resolved through the acceptable order of the commission so that we can all move forward with clarity around the execution that we spoke of on February 10. The capacity case is ongoing as we speak and the procedural schedule for the ESP case has been established that has oral arguments in early July with a decision thereafter. ","So it's been a very good quarter considering the headwinds that exists with the economy, and AEP will remain focused on the execution of the areas we've previously mentioned in February 10. Now I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll explain the quarter-on-quarter variances to last year's results, provide some color on load and the economy at AEP service territories, give some insight into coal and gas switching, provide an overview of AEP's capitalization and liquidity, and then get to your questions as quickly as possible. ","Turning to slide 4. For the first quarter of this year, as Nick mentioned, AEP earned $389 million, or $0.80 per share in ongoing earnings versus $392 million or $0.82 per share for the first quarter of 2011. ","Weather accounted for a negative comparison to last year of $0.12 per share or $87 million. Overall, heating degree days were down 31% versus last year and 29% below normal, as this was the second mildest winter in the last 30 years for the AEP system. ","Customer switching in Ohio accounted for a negative comparison the last year of $0.06 per share or $42 million. This reflects a year-on-year decrease of total retail generation margin and is associated with AEP Ohio's total retail load that had shop by the end of the quarter of 28%. ","As you remember, in Q1 of last year, we were collecting provider of last resort charges in Ohio end of June. The loss of Ohio pool of revenues versus last year accounted for a negative quarterly comparison of $0.05 per share or $39 million. ","On the positive side, Transmission Operations contributed a positive $0.01 per share or $5 million. This reflects increased earnings from Electric Transmission Texas. You will continue to see growth in investment and earnings from ETT and our Transcos, as we put dollars to work to enhance reliability and system efficiency for our customers. ","Rate changes reflecting increased investment in our regulated utility operations accounted for a positive comparison to last year's first quarter of $0.08 per share or $63 million. ","Finally, operations and maintenance reductions accounted for a positive comparison to the first quarter of last year of $0.11 per share or $80 million. This reflects a combination of spending discipline in the face of weather and other earnings challenges, as well as the reversal of a regulatory obligation that was previously recorded. ","Turning to Slide 5, you will see that our weather-normalized residential and commercial sales were lower than prior year, while our industrial sector continues to show improvement, as Nick stated earlier. Overall, weather-normalized sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, reversing a 7-quarter positive trend that was largely driven by the increase in industrial sales. Although our residential and commercial sales were down for the quarter, a number of economic indicators are showing improvement within our service territory. ","First, the economy and AP service territory is growing faster than the U.S. economy and faster than it did in 2011. Real GDP growth for AEP service territory in the first quarter of 2012 is estimated at 4.4% compared to estimated U.S. growth of 2.2%. AEP's 4.4% growth compares favorably to that of the first quarter of 2011 of 2.8%. ","In addition, the unemployment rate in AEP service territory is lower than it's been since the start of the recession at 7.9%, and lower than the U.S. unemployment rate for the quarter of 8.2%. ","We noted that earlier this week, the 4-week moving average for U.S. unemployment claims rose slightly. We hope this is not a new trend for an economy that has been showing signs of improvement. ","The employment growth rate for AEP's footprint was better in the first quarter of this year than it was for all of last year, with employment growth in the West part of our seen system at 2.3%, beating the U.S. rate of 2.1%. ","Employment growth for the quarter in the East part of our system was only 1.5%, but still exceeded the growth rate for the region for last year. Contrary to this positive economic data, we should note that AEP's combined east territory's residential customer count was down 0.2% for the quarter, but that was more than offset by a combined west residential customer count that increased 0.6%. ","We are hopeful that the economic outlook will continue to improve and translate into improved electricity sales in the near term. ","Turning to Slide 6, we're looking at the top 5 sectors in our industrial customer class. Primary metals, AEP's largest industrial sector, is up 4% for the quarter-on-quarter period. If you exclude Ormet, our largest customer, which returned to full production in the first quarter of last year, primary metals were up 1.2% quarter-on-quarter. ","Chemicals and mining were both down for the quarter, but both sectors have shown quarter-to-quarter volatility throughout the recovery. The paper industry, as a whole, has been slowly declining over the past several years. As more aspects of our daily life become paperless, this trend is likely to continue. ","In addition of the sectors depicted on this slide, the transportation equipment manufacturing sector, AEP's seventh largest, is up 5.5% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by improvements from a number of customers located primarily in the Indiana and Michigan and SWEPCO service territories. This corresponds with the fact that U.S. auto sales in the first quarter were the highest they've been since before the recession. ","The oil and gas extraction sector, AEP's ninth largest industrial sector, is up 6.7% quarter-on-quarter and is being driven by developments in the shale gas areas of our service territory, primarily the Eagle Ford development in Texas and the Marcellus development in the east. These increases are coming mostly from gas processing facilities, some of which have come online and others of which are still in development.","Turning to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about the coal-to-gas generation switching that has occurred on AEP system and the outlook for the future. ","First, it is easy to see that coal-fired net capacity factors had decreased, while gas-fired net capacity factors have increase. This result is more pronounced in the east part of our system, where natural gas capacity is 14% of the total versus the west, where it is 62%. ","In the east, net capacity factors for natural gas units increased to 47% in the first quarter of 2012 from 22% in the first quarter of last year. Coal-fired net capacity factors correspondingly had dropped to 47% from 61%. The result is even more pronounced when we focused on our east combined cycle plants, which reached net capacity factors of 78% in the first quarter of this year, up from just 17% from the same period last year. ","If you were to exclude the new just [ph] and combined cycle facility, which came online at the end of January of this year, the east combined cycle capacity factor climbs to 85%. East combined cycle generation increased fully 149% quarter-on-quarter. ","So what does all this mean? With our east combined cycle fleet operating at such a high capacity factor, we would expect the rate of coal-to-gas switching to remain about the same through the balance of the year. That is, most of our combined cycle gas units are running close to flat out. ","With our gas consumption and cash generation up, and with the mild weather that we've experienced, our coal inventories have climbed to 45 days full burn inventory at the end of the quarter from 39 days at the end of last year. We expect inventories to climb over the second quarter. And just as we manage our inventories during the recession, we'll continue to do so now. All of that being said, our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 80% met.","Slide 8. Let's take a look at the company's capitalization and liquidity measures. First, GAAP total debt to total capitalization remained unchanged from last quarter at 55.3%, but the quality of that metric has improved as we added $800 million of AAA-rated debt to the balance sheet, as we executed our Texas Central securitized debt offering in March. ","Securitization financing reduced costs to TCC's customers versus traditional financing and brought a significant cash contribution to AEP. In addition, in February, SWEPCO issued a $275 million 10-year unsecured note at an attractive rate of 3.55%. ","Second, at the end of the first quarter, our credit metrics remained solidly BBB. AEP's FFO to interest coverage stands at 4.7x and our FFO to total debt is at 20%. During the quarter, fixed reaffirmed AEP's ratings and Moody's reviewed and left unchanged their ratings for the company and several subsidiaries. ","Turning to liquidity. Our sources included our core revolving credit facilities and cash on hand, which, together, totaled approximately $3.5 billion. Our uses of liquidity include a commercial paper and letters of credit, which, together, totaled approximately $500 million. When netted against one another, the company's liquidity at the end of the first quarter was nearly $3 billion. ","Lastly, our pension obligation was funded at 90% at the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement from 86% funded at the end of the year in 2011. As our pension funding approaches 100% through improved investment returns and past significant corporate contributions, we are derisking the investment portfolio. ","At the 90% funded level, our portfolio asset targets are 40% equities, 10% alternative investments and 50% fixed Income. ","As you can see, the platform is strong, as we seek a positive ESP order and transition to retail competition in Ohio. As Nick noted earlier, due to uncertainty in our Ohio regulatory outlook, we are unable to affirm our previous earnings guidance for 2012 at this time. ","As a management team, we are committed to an earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% and a dividend level supported by our regulated earnings. ","Thank you for listening today. And with that, Linda, I'll turn it back over to you to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I've got a couple of questions. First, can you comment on the staff position that was recently filed in your capacity case, which I know is separate from your ESP filing? I know that they made some opinions on what they felt was sort of a fair capacity rate. And while I know that that's completely independent from the ESP case, I'm wondering if we can take anything from that as it might be -- as the ESP case unfolds?","Robert P. Powers","Yes, well the capacity rate that came out was actually pretty reasonable, it's the adjustments, I guess, that there's some concerns with. And we expect to get their work papers here Friday, and that'll be helpful to us in terms of determining how exactly they came up with those numbers. But since that case is -- the hearings are ongoing now, I'd be hesitant to speculate on it. But certainly, we'll review that and see what the effect will be.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Because it appears that they come to the conclusion that your sort of Tier 1 capacity rate seems reasonable, but they didn't opine on the level of your sort of Tier 2 -- what a Tier 2 capacity rate might be? Is that fair or unfair?","Brian X. Tierney","Greg, I think the 145 that they netted to is clearly below what we'd view as acceptable. I think the 255, which is -- and they had something close to that on an adjusted basis before they took some adjustments that were probably overstepping is probably closer to what we'd consider to be reasonable.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the second question, where do you stand in your current pending FERC filing? And when is the expectation that we might or might not get a decision on that case?","Nicholas K. Akins","On the FERC capacity case, you mean, Greg?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, correct.","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, that capacity case is in, and we're waiting on the FERC response to it. And we're obviously unable to tell when FERC would actually render an order, but the case certainly is there and ready for them to render an order.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Dan Eggers from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess there's so much going on in Ohio in the quarter as far as ESP on and off. Can you just help detail what would've gotten picked up in first quarter results from kind of the ESP plan and what the reversals were kind of around costs and that sort of stuff that affected the first quarter results?","David M. Feinberg","So Dan, obviously, we've detailed what the customer switching is, and that's reflective of current capacity prices that are in play. There was some pickup in Transmission Operations on Slide 11, as we picked up some of the -- they're paying us for generation and transmission. And some of that migrates to line 11 or -- I'm sorry, the transmission line on Slide 11. And then, of course, we noted a, in O&M, a previously recorded regulatory obligation that has to do with about the $35 million partnership with Ohio Component. So it's really those pieces. It's the customer switching and the partnership with Ohio Component.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, Nick, you talked about comfort with the environmental CapEx plan, the CapEx plan. With the amount of your coal-to-gas switching you guys are seeing and the lower run rate on the coal plants, are you reevaluating that plan one more time before making any firm decisions, given the lower economic value presumably?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, Dan. We continue to look at the options that we have available to us. And obviously, we've committed the capacity in PJM. So it's a matter of how much we have to -- you have to utilize those units. And obviously, they're being utilized less. As Brian said, the capacity factors are much lower. So that gives us some optionality in terms of how the units are operated during the year. And then in terms of retirements, we're looking at the dates associated with those as well. You have the -- and really, it's a question of whether you need the capacity and does it stay online into 2014 or 2015 or even 2016? But if the gas market is lower and capacity becomes available, then we'd have to look at those options as well. So we are looking at that on a regular basis on what those options can be. I was just saying that in the worst case, it appears that we're okay from a capital perspective. And then, if we do get extensions or if we decide to convert to gas in some fashion with gas burners or whatever, we'll have that optionality to do it. So, really, it's a capacity and an energy question.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, Brian, just one last question on the cost management. Of the 80, the 35 was the reversal and kind of 45 was your better cost management. Is that something we can continue to expect will happen on a quarterly basis for this year? Or were there some things that kind of pulled up that we'd assume more of a normalization in cost?","Brian X. Tierney","Absolutely, Dan. I think you've always heard from us that if whether in our system sales and regulatory aren't coming in as we had forecast they would for the year, and all 3 of those things are true for this year, that we would manage our O&M accordingly. And so we are currently in the process of, A, having cut some significant components of O&M ,but we're in the process of evaluating how we might do that more aggressively, not just for this year, but really, as Nick has talked about in the past, trying to reposition the cost structure of this company for the competitive environment that we're moving into.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think that's one basic tentative of the February 10 discussion we had around capital and O&M discipline in response to the environment that we're in. There's no question that where we're at in the economy and as we follow along with that, along with the other issues that we have ongoing, we have to be able to be flexible from that spending standpoint. We're -- and again, it's in the overall context of that repositioning of the company to those growth areas. And we are very focused on, during this year, working on those activities. So we want to reinforce resources for those growth areas. And certainly, at the same time, evaluate the rest of the organization and make sure we're being as responsive as we can to the operating companies, which really goes to the operating company model.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When you talk about your residential and commercial being down on a weather norm basis, is that being distorted by shopping at all, or is that deliveries versus kind of generations sold?","Brian X. Tierney","Paul, that's total connected load. So it's not being distorted at all by customer switching.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, you're $0.06 negative on switching. I think you've got $0.21 in the budget that you've laid out in February 10. Are we running to plan?","Brian X. Tierney","Quarter-to-date, Paul, we are. But so much of that depends on what happens with this ESP case, and particularly, the capacity case. And if we get a negative outcome on the capacity case, and we go to something that looks like RPM, that could significantly accelerate shopping. And so the run rate for the year, given the uncertainty that we face after June 1, is something that's certainly in question. And we wouldn't anticipate that you could just extrapolate the year-to-date numbers and come up with a reasonable outcome with what the capacity case gets resolved at.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, when you say you're 80% hedged on your coal buy for '13, that assumes the same kind of fuel mix as you're kind of laid out in the first quarter?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, that's the same kind of fuel mix, I think, and 80% hedged. That -- it's give or take because you're obviously looking during the year at what the actual coal requirements are going to be. So we continually -- and we're becoming more flexible in terms of our coal contracting to ensure that we do have the flexibility if natural gas prices continue to be low, which we expect they will, that we'd be able to respond from a contractual standpoint.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is building your coal piles more a function of weather or fuel mix?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think it's both. Weather and -- it's weather and natural gas prices. Because one of -- I guess, one of the beauties of our system, we bought 5,000 megawatts of gas in the last few years, or built 5,000 megawatts and it gives a lot of flexibility in terms of if you have low gas prices, they're competing on a marginal basis with coal-fired generation then we can make those adjustments. What we're having to change, obviously, is sort of this black swan event of natural gas prices and making us think about what the future coal contracting provisions will be so that we ensure that they're flexible because there was always an assumption that coal is going to be lower than natural gas. Well, that's not the case, so we need to be flexible on both sides.","Operator","And now, we'll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can I ask first on the sales numbers in Q1? Obviously, the weather was particularly abnormal and then there's negative nearly 3% number you have normalized in residential. Is that -- how confident are you that that's kind of a good reflection of the real underlying usage or the weather models is sort of thrown off by a very unusual winter?","Brian X. Tierney","Jonathan, it's hard to tell at this point. If you look at that chart on Slide 5, you'll see there's some -- been some pretty extreme volatility in that residential number Q-over-Q. Second quarter of last year was up 4.4%, and then it went to moderately negative in the third quarter. So I think until we see a trend that we can hang our hat on, we really need to watch that data. We don't see anything that is a give up the ghost on the residential customer account or usage for us. But obviously, we're watching that. We'll continue to watch that quarter-to-quarter. We don't like seeing it down 2.8% versus last year. But as you stated, it is an extreme weather year, and making sure that our weather normalization calculations are right when you have such extremes as we're having right now. And to be frank with you, as we have last year, you really need to watch the trend over time.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you're kind of leaving the full year forecast where it is until you get a little better sense of the rest of the year?","Brian X. Tierney","Absolutely.","Nicholas K. Akins","That's right. That's right. Because even in today's Dispatch, I think there was a -- Columbus Dispatch, there was an article on housing sales and housing prices moving up. So it's a very sensitive part of the economy right now, and when you look at it, we've had industrials. And as long as we have sustained industrial pickup, you'll see commercials come back in and residential, obviously, come back in as well. And I think that's going to be a positive for AEP.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could on another topic. You talked -- you've obviously talked a lot about Ohio, you talked about positioning for a more competitive future. Can you talk a little bit about competitive activity outside of your territory? How active are you guys able to be, given the amount of focus I'm sure you have at home right now? And obviously, you talked a little bit about the BlueStar integration. But just -- what are you doing strategy-wise in terms of going after margin? And how -- where would you describe yourselves on the trajectory of getting where you business plan needs to be?","Nicholas K. Akins","Jonathan, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration of BlueStar. And they are also participating in Illinois markets, participating in other markets as well. As I've said earlier, though, we want to make sure that we're only participating in markets that we understand. And that would be primarily MISO and PJM-related markets in Texas. We continue to pursue the -- getting a name for a company in Texas. You can't name it AEP, apparently, so we have to name it something else but we're starting that business back up. And I think it's important for us to make sure we take advantage of the back-office systems of BlueStar, which is a major, major positive for us in that transaction. And the people of BlueStar, we have been very, very pleasantly surprised that -- not that there was a surprise, but certainly, the people involved have been very good for our business and have mixed very well with the AEP retail people. So all -- as you said, there's a major emphasis right now on movement in the Ohio market and we're going to make sure that, that happens. But also, we'll continue to progress in these other markets as well. So I'm very happy with the progress there. And remember, it's primarily put in places of hedging activity for the anticipated generation to be separated in Ohio. So we're very much getting prepared for that.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You've talked about this as a cost-saving opportunity. But isn't there -- you're not going to have to add a load of people and capability and structure?","Nicholas K. Akins","No, we've got a pretty significant number of people with the BlueStar acquisition so it really helped us from a marketing standpoint, but also, from the back-office and system standpoint. And we want to make absolutely sure that as we move forward, that our back-office systems are keeping up with the marketing systems upfront so that we ensure the financial integrity of the business. And we certainly believe that there's margins to be made out there. And when you look at the DSM activity and the other energy support services that can be provided, those services provide margins as well. So I'm happy with the way that's progressing to really develop a platform for us for the future. That's one of the silver linings in all this. I mean, I think Ohio certainly wants to move the competition. And we're moving the competition. We support that. And we support it because there's an opportunity, a real opportunity here, to grow the business in a different way. And we just need to make sure there's a transition that makes sense for us to get there, and that's what we fully support.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Jim von Riesemann from UBS.","Jim von Riesemann","I just have a question on clarification. Nick, did you say earlier that you're affirming your 4% to 6% earnings growth? Or were you affirming your strategy to get to that 4% to 6%?","Nicholas K. Akins","No, we're still affirming our 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth.","Jim von Riesemann","How do you get there if you had to withdraw 2012 guidance?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, withdrawing -- as far as the guidance is concerned, it really is determinative based upon what the Ohio outcome is so it depends on what base you're starting from. And I think you can still have earnings growth focused on the regulated businesses -- the other regulated businesses, including transmission, distribution, all the operating companies, and also, the additional transmission business. And that's really -- that confirms the growth rates. So that's -- and then, from an Ohio standpoint, you really do have to look at the risk involved where the case is not a normal case. It's something that we're very focused on, and that outcome will be determinative of what that guidance range ultimately lines up being.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just hopefully a quick question. We spent some time in Columbus this week and kind of one of the takeaways of it was when you had another filing of an ESP last week. I think there's 2 other filings on this, capacity preceding. It seems that most of the intervening parties, if not all including the commission, are pretty fatigued dealing with all these ESPs and capacity and everything else. I mean, is this an opportunity for AEP to maybe reach a settlement, maybe the parties, there's some tight budgets there, people don't have the staff. Is this an opportunity maybe for AEP to reach a settlement with interveners regarding ESP and the capacity filing?","Nicholas K. Akins","I just think we've been at this for over 1.5 years, and there's a lot of people who are fatigued about this case. And we would very much like to get this thing over with. I think if you had a recognition of the other parties involved that yes, AEP does have a transition. Yes, AEP does have a unique situation with its pool agreement and with the commitments made on behalf of the customers in PJM. Those are contracts that we need to get out of. And if given that time, there's an opportunity for settlement. But based upon the last scenario we went through with the stipulation, it's pretty apparent, unless there's some dramatic shift in the positions taken by some of these parties, it's going to be very difficult, indeed, to get a settlement of the parties in this case. I think this is going to be a case where the commission is just going to have to balance the interest involved and make a credible decision. And I think that's key because if they do that, then we get our cases filed at FERC again, we get moving along with all the precursors to move to a full competitive environment with robust competitors. And that's a tone -- a positive tone, that could be set for the state. So I think it's important for that to happen. I'm just skeptical whether there can be a settlement of all the parties that's delivered to the commission this time around.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Steven Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just building on the last question. You've laid out a potential timetable for a resolution in Ohio. Just given what you're seeing today, could you talk a bit about just the factors that could impact that timetable and just general comfort with that timetable, given the latest that you're seeing in terms of discussions?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think that, certainly, we're committed to trying to get the case over with, and I think the commission has also said publicly that they're focused on getting this case moved along pretty quickly. The procedural schedule is set so that due process could be given to all the parties. But we also know that there is plenty of information that's already been provided throughout the entire case. So I don't think there's anything new. Anybody's going to turn over. There's no new rock uncovered here. So it could give the ability to move along more quickly. I think that -- I'm actually optimistic that the schedule will stay pretty much intact because there's been plenty of time given for the parties based upon the issues that we've already dealt with. I also believe that if you get a reasonable outcome and the capacity case or a FERC orders in the capacity case, it could bring the parties closer together. And I just think that there are some major milestone precursors there, the capacity rate, in particular, that could have a benefit in terms of bringing the parties together. That's also an opportunity for a quicker solution.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just following up on a different subject on coal hedging. You have mentioned the you're fully hedged for 2012. Given what we're looking at in terms of the gas [indiscernible] fall. Is there some possibility of potentially being over hedged? And how do you think about flexibilities if you were to need to reduce shipment deliveries that are something where you have to deal with penalty payments? Or is there quite a bit of flexibility here? Can you just talk a little bit to that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, Steven, we have very good relationships with the coal suppliers that we have, and we're working through areas of flexibility that could exist. Also, from a contracting standpoint, we typically have a varied mix of coal supplies, long-term, short-term, that can be managed.  The issue that we have is that you have coal that's specific to specific units and some inventories are low, some are higher. And we're looking at the possibility of moving coals around to the various areas to mitigate the impacts of coal stockpile increases in the event natural gas prices stay low. So all of those kinds of options are being considered and looked at and actively pursued.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And just where you look at today, is there a potential that the hedge level is above the expected usage for the year? Or do you think -- do you see it sort of essentially balanced?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think we'll be okay because, obviously, it all hinges on a long hot summer, which is what we usually hope for in this business. But if you have that kind of activity, then we should be fine.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A handful of questions. One, we've talked a lot about the capacity case and ESP case. Can you talk about the deferred fuel case? It's a big number, $700 million plus of outstanding deferred fuel balances, I don't remember the exact amount. How are you thinking about both the resolution of that case, whether it's separate from or tied into the capacity and ESP cases? And how you get cash recovering? Meaning, is it securitization? Is it over a long period of time? And also, the impact on the customer bill because that's -- like I said at the beginning, it's a big number.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, of course, we'd like to get it securitized, and I think we have to get through the process to make sure we can do that portion of it. You have the reg assets sitting out there, and then you have the secure -- the fuel sitting out there, the fuel deferral. The reg assets appears to be a pretty clear of the path of the fuel issue we have to get through. But Brian, you may have some more details on that?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, Michael, that's just in Ohio. We have a similar situation in APCO West Virginia where we have nearly $400 million of deferred fuel that we are filing to securitize there. And think we're on a faster track to be able to securitize that close to $400 million than we are in Ohio. In Ohio, the securitization law requires that the fuel case be final and unappealable before you'll be able to securitize. So the amounts that we're looking at in Ohio, we'll probably won't meet that threshold of having final orders until 2013. But we believe we could be there as early as this year in APCO, West Virginia, with that $400 million.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And what's the total balance last deferred fuel plus, the capitalized interest on it, on the Ohio side?","Brian X. Tierney","It's about $500 million.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. One other question and a little bit unrelated to the fuel balance items. Distribution case. Is that also still separate from -- and how are you kind of thinking about how that also gets resolved? Are you kind of looking at there's going to be some kind of global settlement and all 4 cases in Ohio come together?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, the distribution case is pretty well done. So yes, so -- and the ESP case really is -- we still have the DRR and those kinds of activities in there. But as far as the distribution case, it's done.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Steve Fleishman from Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the coal to gas switching data, the --  a follow-up on one of the prior question. Do you see any risk of forced bond of coal? Or you think you have enough flexibility? By the way, you mentioned you don't need to do that?","Nicholas K. Akins","No, we don't have any risk of [indiscernible].","Brian X. Tierney","And then we didn't get there during the depths of the recession and we don't see the problem being as acute as it was then, and so we just don't believe that's even in the cards.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. And also keep in mind, I mean, a lot of our contracts are relatively good compared to market and rail rates are obviously good as well. So the coal that's actually running sits pretty well in the marketplace. And as you go up higher in the stack and with the designer coals and so forth, that's where you run into those kinds of issues. So we're flexible in that regard.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I'm also just curious, I realize your western region has, I'm sure, much lower coal-to-gas switching price points. Given that gas has continued to come down, is there a possibility that in the west we see these numbers move much more?","Nicholas K. Akins","I don't -- you could see some movement but typically, you're constrained on coal in the western footprint. The delivery cost of coal in our western footprint is very attractive because it's PRB coal with a good contract, a good rail contract. So those -- it'll be hard for natural gas to compete on a basis with coal in our western footprint. And then from a natural gas perspective, you have older -- many of the gas units are single-stage units with higher heat rates, so you won't see them run as much as you would, like a new combined cycle facility, for example.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question on Ohio. It seems like at this point, the capacity case is going to run and be decided before the ESP. Is that correct?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, we don't know the answer to that. It very well could be. But it could be part of the ESP. We don't know at this point.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So the schedule could get moved out so that they're decided more in line?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. And then you've got to look at what FERC doing as well. So that could play a part in the picture, too.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to clarify the timeline. I know you've talked on that a number of times on this whole Ohio issue. So one thing we do know is that you have temporary relief on the pricing on the capacity that is there until June 1.","Nicholas K. Akins","Right.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Now you'd asked to expedite the capacity case and the ESP case. Can you say that, that did not play out, or is that still a possibility? They're still looking at things July 3 and beyond. So from your vantage point, can we just lay out a little bit again the chronology of events as you see this play out in Ohio?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think you do have a gap there between the end of May when the present capacity rate drops off. And I think -- and you really have to go through the process of what the commission intended to begin with when they put that in place. And our view is, is that, that capacity rate was put in to keep the parties neutral there and dependency of all the -- all these other ESP cases going on. And there have to be, in our opinion, some mechanism put in place, whether we request an extension of the stopgap measure that was put in place or some other methods. So we don't know exactly how that would work out at this point. But certainly, as May rolls around, we see the progress of the case, we'll be making decisions on how we approach that with the commission.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also, to be clear on your position on the capacity, Nick, I mean, last time around you guys were okay with the 2 pricing mechanisms where one was the PJM RTO, the other was the fixed 255. I think you, if I'm not mistaken, have little different positions, whether in the ESP or the capacity case. Where now talking about just a non-PJM pricing-related price. So just to be clear, what is your ideal position on how that capacity should be priced during this transition?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think we have filed the 2-step type approach in the case, and the 140-something-rate was applied to those customers that already said that they would switch through the -- to the November timeframe. And those customers did have already switched based upon that premise would be included, including aggregation. And the 255 was placed there as a discounted rate. It's different, obviously, than the capacity rate that we're after. The capacity case would substantiate the 355 actual cost and we're doing the same thing in PJM. But this is -- the capacity rate, in those cases, are discrete components of a larger case in the ESP. So there's a lot of gives and takes within the entire model of the ESP. So that's where we can go to a 255 and 145 type of application on a tiered approach and it would still make sense in the overall sense with the stabilization charge and those types of things. So that's really the context in which we presented those different capacity rates.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And I know there's obviously an ongoing process, but any signals or signs that you can share with us to suggest that the commission's views this time around may be any different from what played out last time around?","Nicholas K. Akins","The only thing I can say is I think we've addressed the hot button points that the commission had expressed earlier. I can't say today where the commission is on the filing that we've made. Only they can do that. But when you think about the low load factor issue, we've addressed that. We've opened some portion up to auction and energy auction, then going to a full auction even earlier than what was originally anticipated. And then also, from the capacity standpoint, I think we've fortified the record to show that switching is occurring at that higher tiered 255 level. So I think we've done the things that we were asked to do. And it's really, like I said, is up to the commission to decide now.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And last question, also just clarifying your previous statement, so if I'm -- on the EPS outlook. So if I'm clear, what you're saying is, once you've concurrently on the commission that the '12 guidance, you'll come out with a new number. But off that, whatever that number is, regardless of what the outcome is, do you still believe '12 through '15, 4% to 6% EPS growth is doable?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes.","Operator","And now we'll go to the line of Andy Bischof from MorningStar Financial.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","In regards to BlueStar, you mentioned you had about 100,000 customers. Can you remind me what the pace was when the acquisition was announced?","Nicholas K. Akins","BlueStar had 22,000 customers, as I remember, and then AEP retail...","Brian X. Tierney","About 40,000.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, about 40,000 customers. So they continue to make progress there.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And BlueStar has pretty significant capacity in terms of servicing customers before you have to add out into that back-end capability, correct?","Nicholas K. Akins","Oh, absolutely. That's why we acquired BlueStar. And really, they have some of the best information systems relative to retail operations that we've seen, and we obviously looked at several.","Brian X. Tierney","Andy, they were building that business for a much bigger scale than what they had. And the management team over there, before we ever met them, had a very long view of what they wanted to do with that business. And so they've been very thoughtful on how they put their systems together, how they put infrastructure together. And it was that planning and thoughtfulness that we wanted in the management team, and the benefit of their systems and long-range planning that we got with the benefit of the acquisition.","Charles E.

And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's third quarter 2018 earnings call. We just completed another financially strong quarter given positive weather results, continued economic growth, albeit moderated in most sectors of the economy, and continued resolution of regulatory related matters. The headlines for this quarter are not only that our board decided to raise the quarterly dividend by 8.1% to $0.67 a share earlier this week, we're also adjusting our 2018 guidance range upward from $3.75 to $3.95 per share to $3.88 to $3.98 per share.","The economy in our service territory continues to grow mainly in oil and gas-related industries, with others such as chemical industries, primary metals, et cetera, are tempering because of tariffs and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Brian will cover that in more detail, but overall, AEP continues to deliver on its commitment of providing steady, consistent dividend growth commensurate with the long-term earnings growth expectation of 5% to 7%.","As for the specifics for the quarter and the year-to-date, GAAP and operating earnings for third quarter 2018 came in at $1.17 per share and $1.26 per share, respectively, versus third quarter 2017 GAAP and operating earnings of $1.11 and $1.10 per share, respectively. This brings 2018 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.17 per share and $3.23 per share, respectively, versus 2017 GAAP, and operating earnings of $3.07 per share and $2.82 per share, respectively.","The difference between GAAP and operating for the quarter and for year-to-date 2018 are primarily due to an impairment taken related to the Racine Hydroelectric Plant, severance charges taken in response to announced plant closures, and economic hedging activities. This has been another very positive quarter financially and operationally that should bode well for ending the year in a positive fashion.","Because of our belief that we are and continue to be on a firm 5% to 7% earnings trajectory buoyed by a strong base plan into the future, our board was very comfortable increasing the dividend by 8.1%, well within our 60% to 70% targeted payout ratio.","Moving to the regulatory activity, at this point, the notable rate case activity really includes Oklahoma and APCo West Virginia. In late September, we filed another base case in Oklahoma at PSO, our third try to correct the chronic under earning situation in Oklahoma. This case has a requested net increase of $68 million with an ROE of 10.3%.","We have proposed a performance-based rate mechanism that adjusts for certain customer satisfaction and quality of service metrics with the intent of reducing the regulatory lag while ensuring a positive customer experience. The proposed procedural schedule has now been set that provides for interim rates subject to refund going into effect in April of 2019. We are certainly hoping for a better outcome based upon the operational performance of PSO over the years, a financially healthy PSO would be well deserved.","Regarding the West Virginia case that was filed back in early May, we received staff and other intervener testimony that while disappointing regarding adjustments such as a lower ROE, exclusion of certain known reasonable expenses after the test year and lower depreciation rates, we still believe there is an opportunity to enter into constructive settlement discussions to achieve a more reasonable outcome. Procedural schedules have been set in this case with an expected order in late February, with rates going into effect in March 2019.","So now, I'll move to the equalizer chart. I'm going to hold off on a discussion of the premier regulated energy company until a little bit later. But as we look at the equalizer chart, I call it that because it sort of looks like it with the balls of different sizes of the companies, overall, we're seeing a 10.1% ROE. We generally project the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be at or near the 10% range.","Given our geographic diversity, some companies will be up and others down. But as we have demonstrated by our historical performance, we're generally in that 9.5% to 10% range. We currently have six rate cases either recently completed or in process, and I talked about a couple of those that are in process, which will help some of the underperforming companies. I'll remind you, the ROEs are not weather normalized, so generally, across these companies, weather benefited the results.","It's interesting to note though, when you look at the size of the bubbles and how they're changing with the passage of time, our Transco is now the second largest operating utility of AEP. And as you look at the diversity of the service territory, these balls are becoming more or less the same size. Six of them in the various jurisdictions are approximately the same size, so it bodes well for the diversity of the area. And then, as well, as sort of separated out APCo into West Virginia, Virginia. So, if you look at the jurisdictions, with the exception of PSO in Kentucky, they're around that $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion of average equity. So really, a good diverse footprint. But obviously, AEP Transco continues to grow considerably, and we'll be talking more about that at EEI as well.","Regarding AEP Ohio, same thing we talked about last time. You have a green bubble and a gray bubble. And actually, the gray one is the one to really look at here. The green includes some global settlement items such as the RSR payments, the fuel, the PIR, and the 2014 SEET refund. So, it shows a return on equity of 14.1%. But the actual ROE for AEP Ohio is 12.5%. So, most of these legacy items will roll off by the end of the year with a small portion going into next year.","APCo, the ROE for APCo at the end of third quarter was 9.9%. APCo's improvement ROE over second quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to weather. APCo West Virginia, as I mentioned earlier, we filed a rate case there. And in Virginia, we still have the tri-annual rate reviews, and APCo's Virginia first tri-annual review will be in 2020, and will cover the 2017 to 2019 period. So, continuing to make progress with that.","Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky is continuing to grow. It's up to 9.2%. The January 2018 rate case is complete, helping drive the turnaround of the ROE. The change in rates during the year, along with better than expected weather, contributed to that as well. And also, the economic development activity, we had a two-prong approach. Obviously, the rate-making aspects in Kentucky, but the second part was associated with economic development. And we continue to do very well in terms of having construction jobs, permanent jobs being created in our service territory in that region. It's called our Appalachian Sky process, but it continues to advance. Obviously, it helps when the denominator grows as well from a kilowatt-hour perspective.","I&M achieved an ROE of 12% at the end of third quarter 2018, and it continues to perform well in 2018, primarily driven by strong sales in all segments, favorable weather, disciplined OEM spending, and favorable one-time true-ups associated with the regulatory items. I&M is continuing its capital investment program in the nuclear distribution and transmission business units, with positive regulatory structures in place for all programs. So, really doing well from an I&M perspective.","PSO, I talked earlier about PSO, it's now at 7.7% versus 6.5% at the end of second quarter. So weather is really reflected in there. We still have the considerable regulatory lag. And also, as you know, we filed an application for rate-making there in Oklahoma. So, more to come on that.","SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO at the end of third quarter was 7.4%, and the primary reason for the increase in ROE, which was at 6.8%, is weather. And the results also reflect a full quarter of rate relief implemented last year in May in our Louisiana and Texas jurisdictions, and also the 88 megawatts of Turk that was originally attributable to Arkansas is the issue around the ROE for SWEPCO. So, we'll continue to monitor that situation.","AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of third quarter 2018 was 8.8% versus 9.5% at the end of the second quarter. And while earnings have grown year-over-year, the reason for the declining ROE is primarily due to the timing of not only the annual filings that we make relative to capital investments, but also we have a lot of intensive capital investments going on in that territory. So, lag has become somewhat of a factor there, but we fully intend on catching up with the construction activity out there.","AEP Transmission Holdco. The ROE for AEP Transmission at the end of third quarter was 10.4%, and that obviously reflects the ROE being lower mainly due to the reclassification of certain Transmission assets in July and August. And in addition, the East Transco's equity percentage of total capital is higher than filed (00:11:18) due to the recent changes in equity percent cap. So, it drives a higher equity balance, but unchanged revenues. So, we continue to do very well from the Transmission perspective and continue to invest heavily in that area as well.","So, that ends that part of it. And so in a couple of weeks, I will have been the CEO of this company for seven years, working with a management team and a board that takes great pride in our track record of providing our shareholders consistent earnings and dividend growth, while de-risking the company and taking advantage of our industry-leading businesses such as Transmission.","There has been a lot of talk externally that post-Wind Catcher, we would be tracking toward the lower end of the 5% to 7% growth rate. Frankly, I don't know where that comes from, and I just want to reiterate our 5% to 7% growth rate was not predicated on Wind Catcher and remains unchanged. That is exactly why our board approved an 8.1% dividend increase. As a premium regulated utility, we like to keep our dividend well within the 60% to 70% range. And as you can see, the adjustment puts us firmly in that range at 65%. And additionally, we're always trying to do better.","So, I guess I'm left with \u2013 and last night, I was thinking about this \u2013 what sets AEP apart from our peers in the industry? Well, first of all, there's no overhang of large, intensive, risky capital projects. We just don't have that going on. Strong financials that support a robust capital and operating plan; we have thousands of smaller capital projects that are well within our control to execute and get recovery of. There's focus on deployment of capital and process efficiencies to bend the OEM curve, and we'll be talking about some of those examples of what we're doing at EEI.","Diversity in our operating companies, which I mentioned earlier, with the regions of the country and diversity in customer makeup, we're about a third-third-third, industrial, commercial, industrial; and diversity in capital deployed in the various business units to mitigate risk. So, we have the optionality that others may not have; largest transmission provider by far. And you can see the continued, and we'll talk about that at EEI, the continued growth of Transmission with over half of our capital budget deployed on this business with a long runway ahead of us. And growing distribution companies with infrastructure replacement, resiliency, and revitalization through technology, that's going to be a continued growing wedge of the capital that we can deploy. And then, also, selective contracted renewables based upon credit quality, contract terms, and financial construction risk minimization.","We have a real opportunity to invest as we see fit, but it also fits within the general framework of our overall capital strategy around the regulated T&D business. But we can be selective around contracted renewables, and we do that.","And then finally, the culture of innovation and ingenuity, get things done through operational excellence and disciplined execution. That's what we've done year in and year out. You can look at the dividends in the last seven years, the way they've moved, you can look at the earnings, and it shows the consistency of this company.","So, as we move into the rest of the year and into next year with more detail at EEI to confirm our strong position going forward, I want to leave you all with one of my wife's favorites. She played play this 45 single, some of you may not know what a 45 is, but it is a single that happens to be on the ballot for this year's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction, Chaka Khan, and the lyrics from I Feel for You that says, baby, baby, when I look at you, I get a warm feeling inside. There's something about the things you do that keeps me satisfied. I feel that way about AEP.","I bet you never \u2013 I bet Chaka Khan never thought this would be used in an earnings call, but AEP's clear intent over the years has been to be that dependable year in and year out investment that keeps our investors and customers satisfied, a premium regulated utility. More to come at EEI. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on loading the (00:15:31) economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI Conference.","Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.26 per share or $619 million compared to $1.10 per share or $543 million in 2017. Most of this year-over-year growth came from weather and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers.","Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.71 per share, up $0.13. Rate changes were favorable by $0.09 per share. Weather was also a large driver this quarter with the $0.08 increase driven by warmer-than-normal temperatures this summer compared to cooler-than-normal temperatures last summer. These were partially offset by higher O&M of $0.06 per share. Reductions in wholesale load and a reduction in the non-service component of pension costs offset one another.","The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, up $0.01 from last year, primarily due to recovered incremental investment in Texas. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment was comparable to the third quarter of last year due to prior-period accounting adjustments which offset earnings from increased investment. Net plant grew by $1.6 billion or 26% since last September. Generation & Marketing and Corporate and Other were each up $0.01 from last year.","Let's turn to slide 7 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.23 per share or $1.6 billion compared to $2.82 per share or $1.4 billion in 2017. Our regulated segments experienced growth for the year and, as expected, our competitive Generation & Marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales.","Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.74 per share, up $0.47, with the single largest driver being weather which added $0.32. The dramatic change in weather year-over-year was the largest swing in over 40 years. Successful implementation of rate changes added another $0.23. Other favorable items included higher transmission revenues and normalized load, as well as lower non-service pension costs and taxes. Offsetting these drivers were anticipated decreases in wholesale load, as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses.","Through September, the Transmission & Distribution utility segment earned $0.78 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes, weather and normalized load, which were partially offset by higher depreciation.","The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.57 per share, up $0.01 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base, which was mostly offset by minimal formula rate true-ups this year compared to the larger one in 2017. This was expected due to the change in methodology to forward-looking test years last year. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.21 per share, down $0.04 from last year mostly due to the sale of assets.","Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share from last year due to higher interest expense and prior year investment gains. We are pleased with our results and are confident in raising and narrowing our 2018 annual operating earnings guidance range to $3.88 per share to $3.98 per share.","Now, let's turn to slide 8 for an update on normalized load growth. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales increase by three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and were up 1.2% year-to-date. Even though the growth moderated in the third quarter, the year-to-date load performance is still 1% above expectations for the year. In fact, every operating company experienced normalized load growth in retail sales this year with the exception of Kentucky Power.","Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 2.4% for the quarter and were up 2.6% year-to-date. Industrial sales growth has been strong for over a year now. However, the mix of growth across industrial sectors has started to shift. Through the first half of the year, growth was balanced across most industries and operating companies. In the third quarter, growth was dominated by the oil and gas sectors, while the remaining sectors moderated. The shift in industrial sales growth was driven by higher energy prices, the impact of metals, tariffs and a stronger dollar.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales declined by 0.8% for the quarter but remained up 0.7% for the year. For the year to date comparison, normalized usage per customer was 0.2% higher than last year.","Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales decrease by 0.5% in the third quarter, but are up 0.2% for the year. Commercial sales were up in the T&D's utility segment, but down in Vertically Integrated Utilities.","Now, let's move to Slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP's service territory was 2.6% for the quarter, which is 0.4% below the U.S.","Within the last six months, the U.S. economy has eclipsed that of AEP's service territory. The upper right chart shows the gap in employment growth is narrowing between AEP's service territory in the U.S. While the U.S. has experienced stable job growth over the past year, the job market within AEP's footprint has continued to improve.","For the quarter, job growth in AEP's territory was 1.2% with higher growth in the west. The sectors that added the most jobs this quarter were professional and business services, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality. The final chart at the bottom shows that income growth within AEP's footprint has not kept pace with the U.S. in recent months. For the quarter, personal income growth for AEP was 1.5% below the U.S.","Income growth is the key driver for residential and commercial sales growth.","Overall, 2018 has been a strong year for the economy and AEP service territory. The boost to incomes from tax reform and a robust job market created momentum through the first nine months of the year and will cause our load to finish above forecast for 2018.","Now, let's move on to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio remained flat during the quarter at 56.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 19.2%, and our net liquidity stood at about $2.3 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. Net liquidity increased from the prior quarter due to less commercial paper outstanding and recent proceeds from a long-term debt issuance.","Last week, we amended and upsized AEP's core revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4 billion, and extended it by one year to June 2022. The increase in size supports our robust capital program. Our Qualified Pension Funding improved to 104%, and our OPEB funding improved to 135%. For both plans, the funded status improved to a rising discount rate that led to a decrease in liabilities, which more than offset flat asset returns, benefit payments and other administrative costs.","Let's try and wrap this up on slide 11 and get to your questions. The strong results we have delivered year-to-date and our confidence in our plan for the remainder of the year allow us to raise and narrow the operating earnings guidance range to $3.88 per share to $3.98 per share. Our message at EEI will be that we are a premium regulated utility delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth and dividends growing in line with earnings.","Our plan has line of sight transparency to growth, and has greatly reduced regulatory and execution risk. We will provide detailed drivers for earnings by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans. We look forward to seeing many of you in San Francisco in a couple of weeks.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Nick, I love the Chaka Khan reference. And I'm going to throw...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","(00:24:24) in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame this year.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...another reference out there from Chaka Khan, Tell Me Something Good.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, I guess, the wind investment opportunity in your geographies appear to be very good. And I was just curious at a high level, sort of how should we think about the evolution of the potential for additional wind opportunities that might be smaller than Wind Catcher but still very large? What kind of steps or what kind of cadence should we think about in terms of incremental wind opportunities?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, actually, that's probably one of the lessons learned from Wind Catcher, being so intensive and the transmission being pretty intensive as well. We're looking at obviously, smaller segments, smaller wind farms with smaller transmission, multiple areas. We've already started that process. We're also, in parallel with that, doing \u2013 really refocusing our integration resource plans and evolve into various jurisdictions that support that approach. Most of it, you're going to find \u2013 we'll show more about that at EEI. But basically, it's showing renewables. But we also have to be mindful of the political situation and \u2013 in each of our state jurisdictions and the resources that they're looking for.","So, you're going to see resource plans that develop around wind resources, solar resources, perhaps some storage, but also some natural gas. So you'll continue to see that kind of development. And as I said, it will be smaller capacity segments focused on various jurisdictions. And we've already started that process.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. That makes sense. And then just switching over to transmission, just want to make sure I was clear. Given the FERC announcement last week, I guess I didn't see any significant impacts to you all from the FERC activity on transmission, but just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a nuance or how you all thought about that.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No. You're not missing anything. The settlement that was done in the east is pretty consistent with the range that came out of those cases. And I really believe even, there's some discussion of incentives. Incentives are being dealt with the same fashion. The only one we get is the RTO incentive. So, I really believe that discussion, while still initial, I still think it will be supportive of transmission investments. So, we see no change.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's awesome. That's all I have. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. So, I guess, maybe we start with the transmission side and CapEx on the transmission side. Given the support that you probably get with the ROEs, and clearly, there has been some change on the leadership at FERC side, but just wanted to understand what do you see in terms of the opportunity set on the transmission side. You've clearly had a huge impact on that opportunity, but is there incremental opportunity you see there and how do you see that progressing?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Well, certainly, transmission \u2013 I mean, we're already tracking over $3 billion a year in capital investment in transmission. And certainly, with Transource and other opportunities out there, you may see other projects come into play that are incremental. But obviously, we want to be very mindful of where we're investing. We have plant retirements that are occurring, they will encourage more transmission investment. So, we're going to continue to push the organization, the Transmission organization to do as much as we possibly can around capital deployment. So, there's always opportunities.","And also, it has to be in the context of \u2013 the distribution side is growing as well. And certainly, we want to make sure that we're doing the right thing there, too. But as far as transmission is concerned, as I said, really no end in sight in terms of our ability to invest in transmission. And actually, the reasons for transmission investment continue to change all the time. We're seeing further retirements. Obviously, some of those are ours. But also, with \u2013 I think there's no doubt, even when you think about the climate change aspects, the ESG activity, all those types of things that are occurring is going to continue to push for clean energy resources, and that means transmission as well.","We have a lot of resources that are attached and that we enable through transmission, and that will continue to grow. So we'll have more discussion on that at EEI as well.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's great color, and we'd love to hear a little bit more in terms of how to quantify that opportunity set as well at EEI, I'm sure. So, we'll come to that. And then, I guess, secondly, in terms of contracted renewables, just wanted to get a sense for how that is going. You're seeing a number of players continue to invest in renewables. The returns probably continue to get competitive. Where do you see that opportunity set on the unregulated renewable investment side?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So we look at that a little differently than others perhaps because we are accentuated by transmission and because \u2013 largest transmission by far, that's where a lot of our investment goes, but also the regulated operating companies continue to grow as well.","We can afford to be very selective about these projects. There's a lot of projects out there. Some of them have shorter duration, 5, 10 years. That's not what we're really interested in. When we look at our tenure of these contracts, we're looking for long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties, particularly utilities, which we've done across the country. We're in 32 states now.","And also, the actual development and construction risk versus financial risk, we're mostly in the financial risk category at this point in time, and that's pretty meaningful in terms of mitigation risk. So, I would say, we're fully prepared to go as deep as we want to go in that, but we don't have a requirement to be out there everywhere trying to soak up every deal regardless of what it may mean from a risk profile perspective. So, Chuck, is \u2013 I think, is it $750 million of the $1 billion that we had allocated before? And we'll have more on that at EEI as well.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Great. Really appreciate it, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning. Still getting over the Chaka Khan.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Another person wanted me (00:32:09) to use Backstreet Boys, and I couldn't get there.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay. The Ohio tax order yesterday seemed to be relatively flexible. Just \u2013 I think you had already resolved, but could you just give any thoughts on your color on that?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's very much in line with what we had anticipated. So, like so many of the other orders \u2013 and we have some detail on this in the appendix of the release \u2013 it's going very smoothly wherever we've had these occasions. And the range of flowbacks that we have, have also been very reasonable. When we talked to you early in the year, we kind of assumed flowbacks happening very quickly. But I think just about everywhere we've been, the range is 2 to like 18 years, with most of it being in the 10- to 15-year range. It's been very \u2013 and people are being reasonable and Ohio's order was just another instance of that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just in terms of the EEI disclosures on the CapEx and the financing plan, that will be out for the kind of four- to five-year period, not just for 2019, right?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","The CapEx plan will be out for five years, and I think the financing plan, we're going to go out three.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just on the dividend, which was great, just in terms of from here, we should probably assume that now that you're at the midpoint of your payout range, you'll kind of grow it in line with earnings growth from here.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, that's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, Nick. Well, Nick, I'm recovering from learning that I'm one of the only people on my team that knows what a 45 is.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, yeah. I know.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was a (00:34:12) little sad this morning. Could I just \u2013 back to sort of where Stephen (00:34:18) was going, you talked about needing to kind of revise IRPs in the states before you can kind of come with the sort of post-Wind Catcher, smaller footprint, smaller transmission type deals. What's the timeframe for that? Is this something you see playing out? Yeah, well, we'll have some more clarity in the next couple of quarters or is it going to go deeper into 2019 before you really flush (00:34:44) that out?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No, you'll see more clarity soon. And I just want to make clear to you that we already have resource plans filed in the jurisdictions that have renewables in them. I think you're going to see more definition and more focus around what the alternatives are, and also being respectful to what the individual states want to see. Those will start coming out as early as December, and then they'll continue to flow out during 2019. So, you're going to see several first passes here probably within the first quarter of 2019 and toward the end of this year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you give us a sense of where you'll start in terms of \u2013 was there an order to how these are teed up from a regulatory schedule standpoint?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. Each day is different, but I think the first one to come up is...","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Arkansas.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","...Arkansas and then Louisiana. And obviously, they were supportive of Wind Catcher, so there's some real opportunity there to really fashion it to what they're looking for. But each one is different from a scheduling perspective, and each one of them have different views of what resources are applied.","And so, we're going to have to make sure that it's mapped toward that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But we're not talking about a sort of IRP do-over type thing (00:36:16)?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No, no, no. I think it's more of a more refinement, but also there's things we know today that we didn't know even before Wind Catcher. And certainly, gas forecast will change and those types of things, and the way we present things is likely to change as well to where we're being much more of a partner with our commissions and the states in terms of what they're looking for.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, I hear you fine.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Hey, thank you. So I wanted to go back a little bit to some of the updates expected here at EEI as you think about CapEx and kind of reconcile that with the cash flows. Obviously, you've had a few updates through the course of the year. Can you give us a little bit of a sense or maybe a little bit of a preview on how you're thinking about cash flows given some of the updates year-to-date on tax reform and some of the excess \u2013 refunds, if you think about that? I know you have a little table there and even in the latest deck here.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, Julien. So we showed at last year's EEI for 2020 meeting, an incremental about $400 million in equity over the dividend reinvestment program. If we were to show another year, I'd anticipate showing another need just like that in 2021.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. And that is inclusive of the latest tax reform refunds, et cetera, that you've been able to secure for this year, right?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Excellent. Then secondly, turning over to Oklahoma here, obviously, you filed a PSO case and you've talked a little bit about some of the levers you might have over time as you think about that situation and your ownership or not. Is there a potential where you split it apart, Transmission versus Distribution, when you think about ownership and the different jurisdictions here? I mean, maybe can you talk a little bit to the jurisdictional issues, too, just as you think about your desire to be involved in Oklahoma?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, well, first of all, I certainly am looking toward a positive outcome in Oklahoma. I think there's some confusion. We have the Oklahoma Transco and certainly PSO, they're two separate utilities. But, at the same time, I think it'd be somewhat difficult to think of them independently because certainly, PSO and Transco is \u2013 Transco is new transmission, but it's transmission that's within the PSO customer side of things, and it's not all that way. And I think there's a lot of confusion even from maybe the commission perspective and others from what I've read from the investment analysts' reports.","The Transco at PSO, it is an Oklahoma Transco, but it invests in transmission based on what SPP requirements are and in terms of what the customer load requirements are for PSO. Only the cost in the Transco that go to Oklahoma customers are actually ascribed to Oklahoma customers.","And there's this view that we can short change PSO because we get higher ROEs in the Oklahoma Transco. Well, that is really very, very small. I mean, if you were to take the Oklahoma Transco along with PSO and look at the rate structures associated with that, the impact of the Transco is really only like 28 basis points. So \u2013 and I think some people think that we can have 6.5% ROE at PSO, and we're getting 10.5% to 11% in Transco that, okay, that's fine overall, but it's not because the rate base is much bigger from a PSO perspective and only incremental transmission is in the Transco.","And when you account for that, it's not like we're taking earnings and soften them off to the corporate parent. It's that the investment made in the Transco in earnest of (00:41:04) the benefit of AEP shareholders, but also, the PSO returns and investment made within PSO that's also regulated goes to the AEP shareholders as well, any earnings and returns associated with that.","So, this notion that we can average it out and everything's fine doesn't make sense. And so I think we've got to get sort of past that.","As far as PSO's future is concerned, we obviously have been \u2013 and we've said time and time again that we can't have a chronic under-recovery for years and years because obviously, our shareholders are expecting investments to be made in places where we can get very positive returns. In the other state jurisdictions, that's possible. Even in Kentucky, it's come up considerably.","PSO in Oklahoma remains that single situation that we have that really needs to be corrected. And I think we presented a very positive case to say that, okay, we're to provide great quality service to our customers and we're committed to that. But obviously, on the other side, we need to be able to invest and invest and get a decent recovery for it. And that's what performance-based rate-making does for you also in terms of bringing that investment closer to \u2013 the recovery closer to when the investment's made. That's a natural occurrence.","And I say, I think, we've got to get that message across in all of these rate filings. But it'd be hard to separate the two and do something different, and I really don't want to go there at this point. I want to get through this case. And then we look at the situation of the tax basis and leakage and everything else associated with issues of sales, and do we actually have a use for that. So, \u2013 and you're going to see more at EEI. I think there's one of the slides about sources and uses that sort of gives our thinking in terms of what we're looking at. So, I'd rather reserve a lot of that discussion for EEI, but also, as far as PSO is concerned, reserve that discussion to later, certainly after the rate case.","And keep in mind, too, that we have a second corporate headquarters there in Oklahoma. Tulsa has about 618 employees there that are not PSO employees. They're AEP corporate employees. And so, that would also have to be managed in the context of whatever the disposition of PSO would be going forward.","So, there's a lot of things to think about from that perspective, but I really don't want to go there until we fully understand what our role is in Oklahoma. And I think the commission is going to make a definite statement on that this time around. (00:44:31) that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Actually...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","(00:44:34) answer than what you probably asked for, but (00:44:37).","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Indeed. Quick follow-up on the renewables piece just real quickly. How do you see the approval process and demonstration of need for the RFP filing in Ohio? Specifically, how do you think about this given potential changes in PUCO and the wider gubernatorial change?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, I would suspect \u2013 we're following what the framework has been set up to get these approvals for the renewables. And certainly, a change in administration could have an impact, but I think the path is already set. It really is up to the Commission now. We've gone out for bid, we've done what we need to do, and that's at least for 400 megawatts. There's still 500 megawatts to go, and that's probably wind-related resources. So, we still have an opportunity to continue to progress along that path. And I don't really see an impact in terms of \u2013 or a change in the thought process of the Commission itself.","But we've got credible projects out there. We presented a filing that did not have us participating in those two projects of BPA, but given the use of our balance sheet, certainly, there was a factor that we applied to it that included provisions from our financial perspective to ensure that we remain neutral from a capital structure standpoint. So \u2013 and we made that decision and we'll make that decision on any future PPAs. And whether we're actually investing or not investing, I think that goes to \u2013 it goes to the capital discipline that we have of our threshold of returns and risk associated with any capital investment we make.","So, I think we manage it pretty well from that perspective. So, we'll wait and see what the Commission thinks about the two that have been filed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. You're in my era with Chaka Khan, for sure.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And so...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Unfortunately, we're all in the same era or just about.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Well, they don't make any good music anymore, do they?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, they don't.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Not as good as the old days. But the question on the dividend that Steve asked, I just want to be clear because I had asked this question of you guys maybe a year or two ago. You've moved your balance sheet into a really pristine position. And you've indicated to Steve that sort of this 8% move was not indicative of a desire to consistently grow the dividend a nudge ahead of the earnings guidance. So, as you think about that, is it one and done for any good reason other than \u2013 or, I mean, could you theoretically...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...continue to grow it at 8% and be in a strong balance sheet position, or is the cash flow profile, as you move out three, four, five years, in a place where you sort of meet at a place where you really would be penny-wise, pound-foolish to nudge ahead of the earnings growth?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't \u2013 well, I would say it a little differently. I mean, obviously, we've been consistent about the message that our dividends grow commensurate with our earnings. And I think we got \u2013 and we really also feel very strongly that a regulated utility should be in a healthy range within that 60% to 70%. And it started to wag a little bit, and we really felt like some of it was catch-up but also, some of it was confidence. And I think as the board looks at the dividend policy in the future, we're going to continue to focus on what the earnings profile of the company looks like going forward, and we'll be very transparent about that at EEI, and give you some sense of where the dividend will go as well.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Greg, we had previously announced guidance for 2019 for operating earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share. And that move that the board made earlier this week puts our dividend payout ratio squarely in the middle of what we previously announced of 60% to 70%, and the move that they made puts it exactly at 65%. And I think as Nick said, that's just the board in expressing its confidence in our ability to grow earnings over time.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, I get that, guys. I guess what I'm asking is a little bit more nuanced perhaps in that given how strong the balance sheet is and how good you've been in terms of being stewards of that balance sheet.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","If you continue to raise it a notch faster than the midpoint of your earnings growth target, you might be at the higher end of the payout ratio target in several years, but you'd still be comfortably in your credit metric profile. So, is that outside of the realm of possible?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","I think our policy has been from a board perspective, and this comes from the board obviously, that we'll grow commensurate with earnings. Now, okay, so \u2013 and you also have to look at the use of capital. We have plenty of places to put capital, and I think there's probably going to be more definition around that because Brian has just mentioned that we'll be showing five years of capital going forward. That will give you some insight in terms of what the earnings capability of the company is going forward. And then you can take from that earnings where the dividend policy will be.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Okay. And one last question, and perhaps you'll (00:51:09) until we get to San Francisco but when we look out five years from now, is your generation fleet, based on your plans, going to be substantially incrementally decarbonized from where it is today?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. Actually, I think we get \u2013 as far as coal-fired generation, we're in the 30-something-percent range. We've already gone from 65% to I think it's 51%, and it's going to go even further because we've already announced closures of Oklaunion and Conesville. And as you move forward, you're going to see continued activity in that regard, but also, at the same time, our fleet itself is continuing to grow from a clean energy perspective that's added on to it as well. So, that's really what we're looking at in the future.","So, as we transform our generation fleet, we're going to be in the range of 36% coal \u2013 at least down 36% from a coal perspective, up 2% on natural gas, no change on nuclear, up 29% on solar and hydro, wind, and then energy efficiency up 5%. So, you're seeing a very different view of what really is changing from a generation fleet to resources. And those resources include transmission, and they also include the efficiencies within the grid itself that have yet to really been \u2013 you haven't seen that capital picture yet. So, it's going to continue to change dramatically.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","That's \u2013 even without Wind Catcher, that's impressive.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. I look forward to seeing you, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Morning, Christopher.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about the O&M trajectory year-to-date versus your original plan, and any of the drivers that might be underlying that?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So we're going to be up a little bit as we were out with the weather being what it's come in at. Last year, we significantly throttled back O&M in the fourth quarter. This year, given where we've gotten ahead with weather, we've been able to move some things into 2018 from 2019. And so, between shifting employee-related expenses, some things we've taken on forestry, we're going to be up versus what we had previously announced at EEI for last year.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And can you give us a sense as to how much of that differential versus your original plan was due to pulling forward O&M from 2019?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","A relatively small portion, less than $0.10 per share.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my second question is as you look out over the next five years and think about your tax appetite and level of just cash taxes in general, kind of how you think about that? And does that position you well versus your competitors for renewable projects, and position you well even within any regulated renewable projects that you'd like to do in terms of the costs that you can offer your customers?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, we do have tax appetite for both the regulated side of the business and the competitive side of the business. And we anticipate utilizing that tax appetite to the point where we anticipate having a cash effective tax rate on a federal basis of about 5% for the foreseeable future","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you? How are you doing?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Just fine.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Really, just sort of one question here that I have left, and that is the ROE case in New England. I was wondering how you guys were looking at that in the context of the FERC ROE settlement that you guys came up with. And just any thoughts you have about the, I guess it's kind of a proposal, but whatever they're \u2013 what they're proposing in New England which seems to be a new policy in general? And just how you see that in the context of what you guys settled on?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, Paul, when we take that methodology and apply it to our facts, we come up with an ROE that is very, very similar to what we settled at. One of the other benefits that we got from the settlement was the opportunity to increase our equity layer from 50% to 55%. And so, even though the ROE is right on top of where we would calculate it given the New England transmission owners' orders, we think we end up even better than that given the increase in the equity layer.","And then, of course, on top of that, we had, as Nick was talking about earlier, the incentive for being in an RTO.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, when you look at it, just to make sure I understand, you see your base ROE \u2013 you think that the new proposed numbers apply to your situation, would have come in pretty close to where you are...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. We're in great (00:56:52) there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","...where you settled on?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. Very similar.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes \u2013 thank you. And that will be from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Almost missed you, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","One thing I wanted to clarify, Brian. Back on the second quarter call, you had laid out your 2021 CapEx. And now, if I'm hearing you right, at EEI, you will lay out a five-year look. So presumably, that gets us to 2023. One, I wanted to confirm that. And then secondly, should we also expect that your transmission earnings outlook, which currently is out till 2020, that you'll also extend that out to 2023 as well?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Nope. We're going to add a year to that. So, let me confirm that we are going to show five years of CapEx, and we'll show an additional year on the transmission outlook.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I got you. Okay. And then secondly, Nick, you talk about having your sort of blended portfolio ROE somewhere in the 10% range, which is obviously where you're tracking right now. But in actuality, I just wanted to confirm, when you look at what your authorized ROEs are across your jurisdictions and you compare that to the 10.1% LTM ROE that you're running, is there any regulatory lag in the system? And some of it may just be fictional and historical, but just to get a sense of the difference in authorized and actual earned.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. There is a regulatory lag, but also there's \u2013 and we sort of position our cases where they need to be done. In some cases, I mean like AEP Texas, it's a lower ROE because we're investing heavily, but it's a really good recovery mechanism in Texas. The same is true with the transmission. And then, we have the formula based rates in various jurisdictions, and Arkansas has formula-based rates now, and certainly, we're trying to get that at PSO to bring that more concurrent. But there is regulatory lag in there, and we're trying to minimize that as much as possible to bring up the effect of ROEs. That's a critical component of what we're working with our regulators on.","And as far as looking into the future, you're going to have AEP Ohio, that portion dropped off. So the legacy parts of AEP Ohio, the RSR and the PIR and all that kind of stuff, that's going to drop off. But at the same time, we expect other jurisdictions to be picking up. So, \u2013 including PSO. And so, that's part of it as well.","So, it's probably more convoluted than -you can't look at each one of them deterministically because we invest differently in each company at different times, and timing has a lot to do with it, and the O&M spend for various activities. But generally speaking across the board, we always try to get to that 10%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I got you. Last question, I also want to just clarify, at EEI, in addition to extending the time period, did I hear you folks right that given the opportunities that you're seeing, whether it's renewables or transmission, et cetera, that there's also an opportunity and expectation that the absolute amounts of investment also likely goes up as well? Just clarifying if I heard that right.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So we're going to talk about that at EEI.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. But that was not what you had signaled in your comments currently?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We're going to \u2013 we'll give you the full update at EEI, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I got you. Okay. Thank you.","Brian X.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2015 earnings webcast for American Electric Power. We are glad that you were able to join us today. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, at aep.com. Today we will be making forward- looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from the statements. Please refer to our SEC filing for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me for the call today are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Thanks, Betty Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the AEP first quarter 2015 earnings call. Just as with first quarter of 2014, we are off to a great start in 2015, with AEP earnings coming in for the quarter at $1.29 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.28 per share on an operating earning basis. This compares with 2014 first quarter earnings of $1.15 per share on both GAAP and operating basis. So we're very pleased with these strong results and the progress we have made.","Just as with first quarter 2014, the cold weather and generation performance contributed heavily to these positive results. First quarter 2014 was the coldest in 35 years; first quarter 2015 was the second coldest. But this isn't the only story for the quarter. With weather year-on-year being about the same and earnings being higher than first quarter of last year, the difference is the progress we have made in advancing our growth strategy.","This strategy of investing in the regulated companies, particularly Wires and Transmission, focus on continuous improvement initiatives, such as lean practices, the crescendo in savings over time. And a culture of continued disciplined execution of our employees around operational excellence continues to produce positive results.","We continue our commitment to this path and reaffirm our previous guidance of $3.40 to $3.60 per share and a 4% to 6% earnings growth trajectory. I know everyone gets excited and believes we should raise guidance, but remember, we are on a multi-year plan of consistent earnings growth and one quarter does not make a year. We are mindful of softer market conditions because of low natural gas prices, changes in seasonal rate structures in Ohio that reduce summer rates that existed before, and we still have significant outstanding rate cases in Kentucky and West Virginia, not to mention the timing of capacity performance in PPA outcomes to consider.","We also continue to look for opportunities to advance spending from 2016 into 2015 to further mitigate the PJM capacity auction revenue deficiency in 2016 that we have been discussing for a couple of years now.","The economy, which Brian will go into more detail in a few minutes, continues to improve. But once again, we were reluctant to change the forecast, at this point, because of results for load in the quarter, particularly in the residential sector, as Brian will discuss later. Along with a slow down in new wellhead activity, we will monitor the impact of low energy prices overall in the economy. Low energy prices have benefited parts of our economy, but more time is needed to evaluate this trend.","Our process improvement initiatives continue on pace and we continue to be pleased with the results. With the cultural initiatives through our Power Up and lean process, along with lean activities and the ultimate reward of very positive employee incentive results for 2014, employees are energized and focused to achieve our process improvement and savings objectives.","We have completed Lean implementation at 13 plants, including Cook Nuclear, and have 4 to go this year. 13 distribution districts are completed, with a remaining 19 in process to be completed in 2015. Additionally, in Transmission, one area has been completed, with the other 4 slated for this year.","Other areas, such as procurement, central repair shops, customer and distribution services, IT, commercial operations, materials management, et cetera are either completed or in process. We plan to complete all of the initial reviews in the company by the end of the year, to get the full benefit of 2016 and beyond.","Speaking of baseload generation, before \u2013 regarding the February, 2015 ESP order from the Public Utility Commissions of Ohio that contained the PPA proposal regarding the OVEC units, among other riders approved and some denied, the Commission did approve the PPA rider mechanism as a non-bypassable rider, but denied the inclusion of the OVEC units.","The order provided several factors to be considered when future PPA filings are made. AEP filed a rehearing request in late March on this issue and others. And I've since learned that the Ohio Commission did accept the rehearing request. We also, in October, 2014, filed a larger PPA proposal for several other units amounting to approximately 2,700 megawatts. And we will supplement that filing soon with additional information requested from the ESP order and will recommend an expedited procedural schedule from the Commission.","With no long-term price signals from the PJM capacity market that support baseload generation, it is imperative that Ohio defines an energy policy that makes sense for Ohio consumers, those that invest in generation, and for the state of Ohio from an economic development tax and jobs perspective. It is clear that the Rube Goldberg capacity market of PJM can not be depended upon to provide consistent revenue and price discovery to enable the long-term investment potential and maintenance of existing baseload generation. Ohio must regain control of its ability to define resources within the state.","With regard to PJM, AEP believes PJM is trying, in some ways, to fix the problem, and we appreciate that. AEP is hoping FERC will realize the importance, as well, of baseload generation for power energy and ancillary services that enable our power system to operate properly. PJM's capacity performance proposal is a step in the right direction and should be a no-brainer to FERC.","With that said, PJM received a deficiency notice from FERC in February that asked the several questions to supplement the record. From Commissioner Moeller's dissent, it appears there is some support for this proposal. And hopefully, after review of PJM's responses to the questions posed by the Commission, this proposal will be approved, demonstrating the Commission's concern regarding baseload generation in organized capacity markets.","I just got back from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction this weekend, so I still have music on my mind. So there is a song I recall that has the lyrics that a choice not to decide is still a choice. We see this indecision in both Ohio and at FERC with the PPA and capacity performance filings. These cases do have consequences. A vote for these plans are votes for stability of pricing to consumers, reliability of the grid, and the financial integrity of those that provide a critical service to our economy and our way of life. Doing nothing is not the right answer.","On the state regulatory front, the two major cases I spoke of earlier in West Virginia and Kentucky are moving along. In Kentucky, the fuel recovery case took an odd twist in January when the Kentucky Commission rejected recovery of Mitchell no-load fuel cost, even though we accounted for the treatment of these costs for decades in the same way.","We filed an appeal in the Franklin Circuit Court, which in April was stayed pending the outcome of the two-year fuel case at the Commission. Regarding the Kentucky $70 million rate case, most testimony has been filed and the hearings begin May 5. Settlement discussions are occurring and we are hopeful that this can get done soon.","Regarding the $227 million rate case in West Virginia, all testimony and hearings are concluded and we expect to get an order by the end of May. Because of the chronically low ROEs in West Virginia for several years, we were not able to settle, so we expect the Commission to render an order on this one. While we understand the economy in West Virginia has been challenged, it appears to be improving somewhat; and investment is needed to maintain and improve quality of service to West Virginia customers.","The clean power plan debate continues on several fronts. This week, NERC released its report, which follows what AEP has been saying all along, the 2020 targets are not achievable, state review tiled lines, proper electric system planning timelines, construction schedules for replacement resources, and system reliability implications must be respected.","Many stakeholders, including several states are raising red flags regarding this expansive proposed rule that impacts the resources we use and how we use them to serve our customers. FERC technical conferences continue to confirm the issues of the aggressiveness of the 2020 targets and the need for reliability safeguard mechanisms. We are hopeful that EPA will actively listen to these major concerns and that the final rule, due out during the summer, will resolve some of these concerns.","From AEP\u2019s perspective, as the owner and operator of the largest transmission system in this country, including the 765KV backbone of the Eastern interconnect, and one of the largest generators in the country, we take our responsibilities regarding the reliable operation of our grid seriously. We stand ready to work with all stakeholders including the EPA, Congress and the states, to get this right. Too much is at stake.","So now I will move on to the equalizer slide, which is page 4 and I will go through some of the states that we are dealing with here. So from an Ohio perspective, this ROE is in line with expectations sot of it\u2019s around 12% to 12.2%, some round off in there. But it\u2019s split between the last and the current ESP period. So we don\u2019t have any concern about those numbers.","The PUCO yesterday did accept the application for rehearing of the ESP matters. So that was great news that they were willing to take that on again. As far as APCO is concerned, I just talked about the current West Virginia rate case, so that\u2019s really what is occurring there. And we\u2019ve talked about that for several quarters now.","So hopefully, we will get a good outcome on this rate case for that ROE to move up. Kentucky is really atrocious, at this point. It\u2019s at 2.4%. That is because of the regulatory provision that was accorded in the fuel cost recovery disallowance that was related to that Mitchell no-load cost that I talked about earlier. We have the rate case going on there, as well. So hopefully, we will be able to move forward with some type of settlement and improve Kentucky\u2019s situation.","I&M will continue to improve. There is great regulatory framework in place there and support for capital programs at Rockport, with solar, with the nuclear lifecycle management, transmission and distribution projects. There is a lot of great work going on there. So we fully expect I&M to continue to improve. PSO is right in line with expectations. There is some O&M timing issues there. But at 9.2%, it\u2019s in pretty good shape.","SWEPCO continues to struggle with the Turk portion, the Arkansas portion of Turk. We did get some positive legislation that allowed for the ability to really roll through with a rate case and recover Turk. But we really need to wait for the conditions to be right from a market perspective, so that we can make a proper filing. So we, obviously, are watching that process.","In the meantime, SWEPCO continues with additional cases, transmission recovery in Texas. The Louisiana Commission approved the latest rates there, $15 million of revenue additional. And also, new cases will be filed in certain areas of the SWEPCO jurisdictions, as well. So we will continue to see some lagging, but hopefully, we\u2019ll get to a point where we can get the Turk portion all settled out. As far as AP Texas is concerned, it\u2019s come down quite a bit because of increased distribution CapEx. We\u2019re spending a lot of money there, with additional customers being connected and that kind of thing.","But also, we\u2019ve had to infuse equity to replace the tax obligations that were due to the related deferred taxes from securitization. So there has been an equity infusion there that\u2019s changed those numbers. And then as far as the Transmission is concerned, the holding company for Transmission is right on target with where it needs to be, and we continue to invest heavily in Transmission. So slightly down from last quarter, it\u2019s 8.7%. But we expect that to come up in future quarters.","So with that said, I wanted to talk a little bit about the unregulated generation. That process continues, obviously, with the capacity performance delay that has occurred relative to FERC. Hopefully, FERC will act on that soon, and then the markets can go forward with the capacity auctions, which are of considerable value in this process, we believe. So we need to see the outcome of that, and then see how the PPA process progresses, as well, within the state of Ohio as we move forward in those decisions. But the framework is set. The groundwork is set. We just need to plug in the numbers and understand the valuation.","So that\u2019s really an update on that portion of it, at this point. So before I conclude, I want to give a shout out to our employees, who typically listen to some of these calls, particularly at the disposition plants, which among them are those units that will be retiring at the end of May. As you know, we are retiring almost 5,750 megawatts of generation that\u2019s going to retire here in May. The closure of the plant sites is a difficult process, one in which generating units are harvested with a little investment, incquiring the ingenuity of those involved to keep running with, what I call, Swiss cheese boilers.","There is also the very personal sacrifice of those employees and their families that will now move on with their lots of others plans pr retire or several from the company. These generating units have provided the backbone of the American dream for decades, providing power to this country and countless benefits to the communities we are privileged to serve. In the age of word coal being a four-letter word in some circles and not even mentioned among America\u2019s resources, even though coal still is the predominant fuel, we want to say thank you and job well done for those that understand what it takes to make our power system work and how important your work has been so long. So overall, a great quarter, a great foundation to build upon, and we continue with all cylinders clicking. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On slide 5, you will see our comparison of 2015 operating results to 2014 by segment for the quarter. Operating earnings for the quarter were $625 million or $1.28 per share, compared to $1.15 per share, or $560 million last year. This solid performance was driven by the execution of our regulatory plans, continued growth in our Transmission segment, O&M cost control, and strong marketing results, which together more than offset the adverse effect of lower wholesale power prices. Weather had an equally strong impact on the first quarters of both 2015 and 2014.","With that as an overview, let\u2019s review the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on slide 6. 2015 earnings for the vertically integrated Utilities segment work $0.61 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions, and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by a decline in off-system sales margins and normalized load. Rate changes in regulatory provisions were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.04 and $0.03 per share, respectively.","The favorable effect of rate changes on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers. The effect of the Virginia rate freeze included in regulatory provisions added $0.03 per share. This segment also benefited from lower O&M expense, primarily due to the reduced employee related costs adding $0.03 per share to the quarterly comparison. The $0.09 per share decline in off-system sales margin was driven by much lower power prices this year. The favorable $0.04 per share PJM expenses was related to high PJM costs during last year\u2019s Polar Vortex events that were not recovered in rates.","Normalized load adversely affected the comparison by $0.04 per share and was primarily driven by lower residential sales in the East. I will talk more about load and the economy in a few minutes. The Transmission and Distribution utility segment earned $0.20 per share for the quarter, unchanged from 2014. The Transmission holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.07 per share for the quarter, an increase of 40% over last year.","Year-over-year, this segment\u2019s net plant grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 61%. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.38 per share $0.05 to the quarter. This was driven by the strong performance of our Generation and Commercial organizations. The quarterly results also benefited from lower operating expenses at our power plants. AEP River operations contributed $0.02 per share in 2015, $0.01 more than last year, due to lower operating costs.","Corporate and other earnings were $0.01 better than last year\u2019s results. In summary, our regulated utilities executed on their rate and investment plans, exercised cost discipline, and benefited from cold weather. In addition, our competitive businesses took advantages of opportunities presented to them. The combination of these efforts allowed us to exceed last year\u2019s first quarter performance by 11%. In all, as Nick said, the Company is off to a good start in 2015.","Now let\u2019s take a look at slide 7 to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right corner, you can see that weather normalized retail load was down 1.3% compared to last year. Overall, the decline in normalized residential sales more than offset the growth that we saw in our industrial class. In the upper left quadrant, you can see that our residential sales were down 4% compared to last year. However, as Nick said earlier, in 2014, we experienced the coldest winter in AEP\u2019s service territory in over 35 years, including the two Polar Vortex events, which may be skewing the year-over-year comparison.","As we discussed previously, we saw consumer behavior change during these extreme weather conditions. So while the #% drop in residential sales this quarter is noticeable, residential usage is in line with expectations. In fact, since 2013, our first quarter residential sales have grown by an average of 0.10% per year, with modest growth in customer accounts being offset by a slight decline in customer usage. Our residential customer growth for this quarter remained steady at 0.30%, in line with last year.","This gives us comfort that the load forecast underlying our 2015 guidance is on track. In the upper right corner of the slide, you see commercial sales were down 0.40% for the quarter, consistent with our projection for the year. We saw the strongest commercial sales growth this quarter in the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, where customer counts increased by 0.70%. By comparison, the vertically integrated segment saw commercial customer count growth of 0.40%.","Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you see our industrial sales growth moderated a bit from last quarter, but still grew by 1.2%. We continue to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas-related sectors, despite the recent decline in oil prices, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. Outside of the oil and gas sectors, we saw the strongest growth in the chemicals and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors, both of which benefited from low oil and natural gas prices. ","With that, let\u2019s review the most recent economic data for AEP\u2019s service territory on Slide 8. Starting with GDP, the estimated 3.3% growth for the U.S. economy eclipsed the 2.1% growth for AEP\u2019s aggregate service territory. The comparison to the U.S. should not be interpreted as weakness within AEP\u2019s regional economy, since we have seen steady growth of over 2% for the last seven quarters. I would like to point out, in the upper right chart, that the improvement we saw in our Eastern footprint this quarter was offset by a modest slowing in our Western footprint, which has greater exposure to falling oil prices. ","In the bottom left quadrant, you can see that the job market within AEP\u2019s service area continues to improve in step with U.S. employment recovery. Once again, job growth within AEP\u2019s Western territory exceeded both the U.S. and AEP\u2019s Eastern service area. The sectors showing the strongest growth for the quarter included construction, leisure and hospitality, and manufacturing. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest drop compared to last quarter is the natural resources and mining sector, which is not surprising given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts. ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening within AEP\u2019s footprint. We are still seeing significant load increases in the parts of our service territory located in and around major shale formations. For the quarter, industrial sales in shale counties were up 14%, compared to the 6.10% decline in non-shale counties. We\u2019ve added the price of oil to the slide, and it shows that while we are still seeing significant growth in industrial sales within our shale counties, the growth has moderated somewhat over the past nine months, as the price of oil began to drop.","The bottom chart highlights our industrial sales growth by major shale region. It shows that we are experiencing growth in all the major shale plays within AEP\u2019s service territory with the exception of the Eagle Ford area. The strongest growth for the quarter is happening around the Woodford, Marcellus and Utica shale regions. The shale county charts on Slide 9 show the industrial sales growth for specific geographies, which includes direct, indirect and other support industries, as well. ","On Slide 10, I would like to narrow the scope to show you just the industrial sales performance for the oil and gas related sectors. There are three sectors to examine here, oil and gas extraction, which captures the upstream activity of exploration production; pipeline transportation, which captures midstream activity and includes processing, storing and transporting oil and natural gas liquids and petroleum and coal products, which includes downstream activities of refining and producing the finished product.","We are using this chart to illustrate a few points. First, we have not seen the impact of falling oil prices in our sales to the oil and gas sectors. We have noticed some impact to customers and support industries, like metals, who provide the tubing used in drilling operations. But our sales to the oil and gas extraction sector continue to grow at a steady pace. This is consistent with the production data published by the Energy Information Administration\u2019s monthly report. Thus far, although rig counts are down 43% from the end of last quarter, production remains near historic levels.","The second point to make here is that we are seeing the most substantial growth in sales to midstream customers. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been so large that it has jumped from our 10th largest sector in 2013 to the 5th largest sector currently. Finally, while we have heard of a few delayed or canceled projects that were originally planning for later this year, we have also learned of other industrial expansions. In summary, this quarter\u2019s load performance was not a surprise and we are comfortable with our underlying load forecast. ","Turning to Slide 11, let\u2019s review the financial health of the Company. Our debt to total capital has improved to 53.8%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage, and FFO to debt have improved from last quarter and are solidly in the BBB and BAA-1 range, at 5.62 times and 22.2%, respectively. The funded status of our qualified pension decreased approximately 1% over the quarter and now stands at 96% funded. This was largely driven by a 19 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The funded status of our OPEB obligation stands at a healthy 116%, down slightly from 118% at year-end. This decrease was also driven by falling discount rates. ","In addition, our liquidity position stands at $3.5 billion. This is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. On a final note, we are working to refinance our AEP Generation Resources $500 million term loan facility. By the end of the month, we intend to close on the new facility that will result in reduced rates and fees while maintaining the strategic flexibility we need at this juncture. ","Let me close with Slide 12 by saying the Company is off to a strong start for 2015, with all of our business segments finishing equal to, or better, than last year\u2019s results. We are committed to deliver a 4% to 6% growth rate and we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. As Nick described earlier, we\u2019re in the midst of some key regulatory proceedings in Kentucky and West Virginia that could have significant impact on 2015 earnings and beyond. We are maintaining the discipline around operating expenses that you have come to expect from us. ","And finally, Transmission holdco is on track to deliver $0.38 per share of earnings this year, up from $0.31 last year. The investment in critical transmission infrastructure continues to provide us with growth opportunities well into the foreseeable future."," With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Daniel Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.","Daniel Eggers","Hey, good morning, guys.","Nick Akins","Hey Dan, how are you?","Daniel Eggers","Great. Thank you. On the Ohio generation conversation, you\u2019ve gotten a little more public as far as your prospective plans for exiting that business. Have we thought about a kind of a timeline of progression of thought, how much clarity do you guys need to see around RPM or around maybe First Energy\u2019s PPA process in Ohio before you feel like you\u2019re at a point where you\u2019re going to optimize the value of those assets?","Nick Akins","Yes, so certainly, we need to see, as I mentioned earlier, the capacity performance. Hopefully, FERC will approve that. We can get on with the capacity auctions. We have some interim auctions, as well, as a result of that. And then we also have some auctions on the Ohio side that occur in April\/May timeframe. So that\u2019s one set of issues. And that\u2019s on the right side of the ledger. On the left side of the ledger is the PPA issue itself. And it sounds like FE is going to be in hearings in June\/July timeframe. So we would want to hear directionally where the Commission is going regarding the PPAs. ","Obviously, we have the open door in terms of the last order we received that said it was legal and we could do the filings. But we really need some direction in terms of what that means going forward. Now whether that\u2019s defined by the FE case or our rehearing or our case remains to be seen.","But certainly, with the new leadership over at the Ohio Commission, we are hopeful that we can see a more consistent approach to this, and make sure we get these orders out quickly so that the market, particularly in Ohio, can understand where we are going next. So those are two big value propositions that we need to get a sense of in this overall process.","Daniel Eggers","And I guess you guys have talked about using that money, presumably, I guess, to go into transmission investment or back into the utility business. How quickly can you scale CapEx at transmission, if you were to get that large amount of sale proceeds back in? Is it a multi-year process to deploy the capital? Or how speedy can you be using that money elsewhere?","Nick Akins","Yes, so with our Transmission business, we have a really good speed toward moving projects forward. I mean we have a whole litany of projects that are ready, willing and able, from a capital standpoint. So we are ready, from that perspective. But typically, it will take a couple of years before you start to see the earnings from these facilities to be put in place.","So it remains to be seen as something we will have to feel our way through, in terms of whether share buy backs, earn outs, or something like that in a transaction. Those things are critically important to determine the amount of dilution during that period of time. And obviously, we are trying to mitigate any dilution that could occur during that period. So a lot of work going into what the options are that are available to us. But just know that we are focused on trying to mitigate any type of transition from that respective.","Daniel Eggers","Got it, thank you guys.","Operator","And your next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Looking at page 15, on the key drivers for the vertically integrated utilities, there\u2019s a $31 million favorable in the quarter from decreases in unrecovered PJM charges. Can you talk us through what that specifically is? And is that going to annualize, or is that sort of related to Polar Vortex issues?","Brian Tierney","Greg, this is Brian. Good morning. It was mostly related to the Polar Vortex issues, and it was related to costs associated with reserves and operating expenses that PJM passed through to us in the real time during those Polar Vortexes, that over time and rates, we could get reflected. But given that it happened realtime and we couldn\u2019t get those get those in rates immediately, we had to eat during 2014.","Greg Gordon","Great. While we are on subject of PJM, the deadline for FERC to allow PJM to extend its tariff and hold its capacity auction later in the summer, then the current schedule is tomorrow? Or is your expectation that we\u2019re going to get an extension?","Nick Akins","Certainly, that would be the best outcome. Who knows what FERC will come up with. But I would suspect, with the actual operator, in terms of the auctions, requesting that because of the disruption that would occur relative to the market itself, I think it's probably a \u2013 it should be a no-brainer. But it remains to be seen. But our expectation \u2013 I mean we would be surprised if they didn't, at this point.","Greg Gordon","I think, so would the market.","Nick Akins","Yeah.","Greg Gordon","Thank you very much, guys.","Nick Akins","Thanks.","Brian Tierney","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin","Hi, good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin","So perhaps to follow the sales question, can you comment a little bit about the River operations and where you stand on that, and the thought process about that in the context of a regulated mix a little bit?","Nick Akins","Yeah, so as far as River Ops is concerned, we obviously announced that we engaged Morgan Stanley to work with us on that process. That process continues. And it's another one of our commercial business is that we are looking at relative to the valuation and disposition of that business. And they are doing a great job. The company is in great shape. But we want to make sure that it fits strategically within the framework that we have going forward. And so that process continues. And I really can't say anything more about it at this point in time.","Julien Dumoulin","Do you have a timeframe that you're thinking about, though, just broadly?","Nick Akins","My view is that that transaction, if it were to occur, certainly has less issues with it, in terms of milestones to get through. So I would say that the ease of that transaction is probably very different than the rest of the of the unregulated generation on the commercial side.","Julien Dumoulin","Got it. And then turning to the regulated business here, let's go down South, Arkansas. In terms of Turk, can you comment on the process to address that and avenues for this year?","Nick Akins","So at this point, I mean SWEPCO is in a situation where the market with natural gas and those types of issues are of legitimate concern. So you want to make sure you can put the best foot forward whenever you do go in for recovery of Turk. And the legislation certainly helped out in terms of bypassing a CCN process and being able to file part and parcel to a rate case type environment. So we have to make sure that from an overall rate case standpoint, that it would make sense to file in Arkansas, not only in terms of valuation of Turk and be able to put forward a credible case, but also where you stand from an overall spend situation in Arkansas, as well.","So we're going to have to figure out the timing of that kind of filing. Meanwhile, SWEPCO continues to work on other things to reinforce the valuation. We have a large steel customer that's coming online later on this summer. And also, we've got several other cases in Louisiana and in Texas, with the recovery mechanisms in place there, with formula rates and so forth, and transmission, actually, true ups of those kinds of investments. So it's sort of a patchwork to fill in until such time we can get Turk in line.","Julien Dumoulin","Got you. Excellent. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Okay.","Operator","And our next question going to come from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go head.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. How are you?","Nick Akins","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Ridzon","Looking at slide seven, just kind of the residential sales were very strong last year, down this year. But this isn't a weather adjusted slide. Is this just kind of modeling errors on your weather adjustment, because things were so extreme?","Nick Akins","Paul, we've been debating this one for a quarter now. But it's sort of interesting. I'll give my rendition, and certainly Brian has a lot deeper information on this. But when I was doing load forecasting early in my career, it was down in Texas. And you'd have 45 days of 100 degree weather. And you'd see this thing occur that would wind up being a step change and a super peak. And I think it wound up with customers deciding, to heck with it, I'm going to turn my air conditioner on in this heat. So you would see a step change. I think you saw the same thing in the Polar Vortex in 2014, where it's consistently sub-zero for a long period of time. And at some point, people decided they wanted to be comfortable. So you're sort of measuring a present day versus an anomaly. And that sort of drives a skewing of the residential information. That is why I said earlier, we want to see how that settles out from quarter to quarter going forward, so we understand exactly what the steady-state aspects of that is. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Paul, just adding to that a little bit. I think across the industry, we saw weather normalization in residential in the first quarter of last year look similar to ours. And it looked a little bit out of whack, and it sort of normalized over the balance of the year. That's why, as Nick said, the quarter-on-quarter comparison of this year to last year looks kind of negative. We're interested in seeing how the balance of the year flattens out and what that looks like. But we really believe last year's first quarter weather normalization to be a bit of an anomaly.","Paul Ridzon","So it's an art, not a science. Okay. And then last year, after a very strong first quarter, you started talk about pulling forward some O&M from the forward year. At what point are you comfortable doing that in 2015?","Nick Akins","Yes, Paul. We're starting that process now. Actually, we've already started it. We do have some O& we've identified that could be pulled forward. But at the same time, it becomes \u2013 we pulled $60 million forward last year. So now, you're really getting into areas where, okay, can you pull forward, from that prospective? So it becomes a little bit more difficult. So we're having to reach deeper and think really hard about how much we can actually move forward. So that process is continuing and something that we are very mindful of, given that we started the year somewhat ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Is there reluctance to do it until you get a little more of the year under your belt?","Nick Akins","No. No. I think we have identified and started that process and we will continue it on. Now keep in mind, last year we had relatively mild summer. So we will continue looking at the levers and looking at the quarter by quarter performance, and we will make adjustments accordingly. We've gotten pretty good at that.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Nick Akins","Yep.","Operator","And our next question in line will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go head.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Nick Akins","Yes. I can hear you.","Paul Patterson","First of all, on the trading business, that seemed to be pretty beneficial this quarter. What are the expectations for the year?","Brian Tierney","we think it's in line with what we've previously stated for the business, Paul. There are a couple things going on there. They continue to do their normal activity. So the trading and marketing they do, they had a couple of big deals that they got closed in Texas, which were positive for the quarter. But don't forget that when we laid guidance out for 2015, there is about a $0.35 hit associated with changes in capacity revenues in that business. So we think we're on track. We are little bit skewed towards being ahead for the quarter. But the real drags on that business are going to be the latter half of that year, as we experience the fall off in capacity revenues.","Paul Patterson","And what happened in Texas? I'm sorry if I'm missed that.","Brian Tierney","We had some normal ongoing marketing activity that we do down there. So as we own these businesses, we're going to continue to operate them with an eye towards the long term. And they were able to renegotiate and change the terms a bit on a couple of contracts that they have down there, which is normal ongoing business for us. But that was beneficial to the quarter.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Then in terms of just Ohio, I mean is everything pretty much going to be \u2013 I mean, obviously, there is all this focus on PUCO. Is there any potential for the Governor or any other direction to sort of come from, I guess, legislative or the executive branch, in terms of the direction that the state wants to go into? Or is it really just going to be something that PUCO is going to be wrestling with on its own? Any thoughts about that?","Nick Akins","I think for the time being, it\u2019s going to be centered at the Commission, because Andre Porter has moved over as Chairman, who previously was involved with the deregulation that occurred some three years ago. And so he knows and understands the issues. And also hopefully, understands the lessons that have been learned since then, as well. And I think he and the Commission, under his leadership, will continue to provide direction, but also consistency and get these orders done.","He has also brought on a new chief of staff, which we have certainly met. And he appears to be very, very professional about what he is doing, as well. So I think with some sense of consistency around leadership and in terms of direction associated with the staff itself, at least I am hopeful that things will start moving pretty expeditiously in Ohio.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just finally, it was the seams issue between PJM and MISO. There\u2019s been some activity in it. And I think there\u2019s been sort of a push on the part of FERC to move things along. Does that \u2013 do you guys see any significant impact from that, positive or negative? You guys have served in different areas there. And of course, we\u2019ve got questions about what\u2019s going to happen with the merchant sector anyway. But anything we should be thinking about with respect to that and how it might impact your merchant plants?","Nick Akins","No. I don\u2019t think we see much impact, from our perspective, and as far as MISO is concerned. I mean, one thing is for sure, they really need to start thinking \u2013 PJM and MISO need to administer that contract they have with each other, from an operational standpoint. I know there have been issues that have come up relative to how they actually administer the flows over the lines. But I think as far as we\u2019re concerned, though, we\u2019re in pretty decent shape.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brian Henn with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Brian Henn","Hi, good morning. Just a quick one.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Q \u2013 Brian Henn","On the 4% to 6% EPS CAGR growth rate outlook, in general is there a Brent crude oil price environment that you are thinking about when you reaffirm that guidance? I realize these things are probabilistic. But it would be helpful to know if you\u2019ve got an oil price in mind.","Nick Akins","Certainly, we haven\u2019t gotten down into the fundamentals that much. But from our perspective, it\u2019s really around natural gas pricing. As far as oil pricing is concerned, it\u2019s a measure of how much the rig count changes. But that\u2019s reflected in natural gas as well. So from our perspective, we continue to look at, at least our factors relative to the industrial mix that we have and the impact of energy prices, because even low oil prices can reflect well in the economy that we serve.","And so we have sort of a natural hedge going on here, where oil and gas pricing has benefited some counties, with shale gas production and that kind of thing. But on the other hand, low natural gas prices have helped chemical manufacturing, car manufacturing and so forth. Brian, do you have anything you want to add?","A \u2013 Brian Tierney","That last point that you got nailed it in my mind, Nick, in that we do have that natural hedge going on. And we see things like transportation equipment manufacturing is positively impacted by the low oil and gas pricing. So where we see some delays or closures in terms of economic expansion, we also see some expansions going on. And those things, to date, have really offset one another.","Q \u2013 Brian Henn","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","Good morning, guys. I have a question on slide 6. I guess in three of the business segments, you guys had some cost-cutting error, some cost management where O&M was off, operating costs were a positive driver. How much more can we expect of that going forward, or is this more of a timing issue?","Nick Akins","Some of it is timing. But overall, you will continue to see O&M continue to be consistent from the perspective of ensuring that we mitigate any increases. Because obviously, you have overheads, salaries, those kinds of things continue to go up. But we\u2019re mitigating that, in many respects, from an O&M perspective. So our O&M stack continues to be consistent, relatively consistent from year-to-year. We expect that to happen. So Brian, you may have something else.","A \u2013 Brian Tierney","Anthony, we\u2019ve worked really hard to keep that O&M flat to down over the last several years. And then looking out into 2016, as we have those capacity revenue challenges in that year, we are very, very focused on keeping O&M in a very tight range. We have been able to keep it in that $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range, even with some of the natural increases that you would expect that we would have associated with things like our transmission expansion. So the Lean activities that Nick talked about have us very focused on O&M, keeping it flat to down over the long term. What you see on slide 6 is what you should anticipate seeing going forward as well.","Nick Akins","So I think it may be a part of both. But keep in mind that there will be a consistent view toward that perspective.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. And just lastly, I know you\u2019ve probably spoken ad nauseum of it, just the unregulated generation in Ohio. If I understand correctly, before any decision is made on how AEP handles it, you want some clarity on the capacity performance auction and also the Ohio PPA process. Is that accurate?","Nick Akins","Yes. That\u2019s accurate.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. How are you?","Nick Akins","Fine, fine.","Ali Agha","Nick, just listening in to the commentary and from the results as well, is it fair to assume that first quarter puts you somewhat ahead of budget? Obviously, it\u2019s very early in the year. And if so, how much cushion is there for you right now \u2013 you talked about pulling forward some expenses. Is there any way to quantify how much cushion you have as we look for the rest of the year?","Nick Akins","I think we have enough cushion to be comfortable with starting to take steps and being more aggressive about what we do, relative to moving O&M up and doing other things to reinforce the issues that we have in 2016. So just as with last year, where we got ahead, we will be looking at taking additional steps. And we will manage that from quarter to quarter. In this case, though, I think you have a quarter where, certainly it looks \u2013 it\u2019s really positive.","But you have a different set of underlying factors to consider, like last year at this point in time, there really wasn\u2019t much of a rate stack to fill in or anything like that. And this time, there is some larger swings that can occur. So I would say, overall, we are very confident about our ability to aggressively pursue in a positive way. Obviously, it\u2019s a better problem to have than if it was on the downside. So we feel good about where we are at.","Brian Tierney","Ali, you\u2019ve come to expect from us over the years that we are going to manage our way through a year and across years. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. So the guidance that we laid out, we are still comfortably within that guidance for the year. And as the year goes on, depending on what happens with earnings and cash flows and the like, you\u2019re going to see us managing our way to stay in a range that puts us in that guidance, and then within that 4% to 6% growth range that we\u2019ve talked about over several years.","Ali Agha","Got it. And also, just to clarify another point on the merchant, in the past, Nick, you\u2019ve been fairly consistent that you expected to reach a resolution over the summer timeframe. We have talked about some things getting pushed back. Even if the PJM capacity gets pushed back, I think they\u2019re still talking June through August. So I guess technically still in the summer. But the PPA rider may be further down the road. So is summertime still what we should think about? Or how should we think about, given some of these delays in some of these milestones?","Nick Akins","Yes. I think it\u2019s difficult to tell at this point. Because obviously PJM is trying to push aggressively to get the auction done as quickly as possible. So if we hit early summer and that kind of thing \u2013 and then the previous questioner obviously was asking somewhat the same thing. From the Ohio perspective, we just need to know directionally what Ohio is going to do. So whether that comes from our rehearing, or FE\u2019s PPA case, or ultimately our larger PPA case, we just need to understand what that sense of direction is going to be. And so I am not going to say it\u2019s going to fall back at this point, from a decisional process.","Certainly, the delay takes away some of the wiggle room that you had for the summer. But it\u2019s really hard to hard to say, at this point. We will have to keep our ear close to the ground, in terms of what FERC is doing and what the Ohio Commission is doing to resolve that issue. I guess my main point is that we have gone through the analysis. Our Board has been involved every step of the way. So our reaction time is very minimal, at this point. We just need the factual information.","Ali Agha","Okay. And one last quick question. In your longer term Transmission growth slide that you\u2019ve shared with us, you\u2019ve had higher growth case scenarios, particularly for 2016 and 2017 that are fairly meaningfully higher than base scenarios. Any of those projects yet that are moved into base, as we look in the 2016-2017 outlook?","Brian Tierney","Not in that timeframe. We\u2019ve been able to fill in some of the gap in 2015, so far. But Ali, as you look at some of the earlier questions that we got, if there are going to be transactions, in terms of use of proceeds, that\u2019s primarily where we would be focused on filling in the gaps.","Ali Agha","All right. Got it. Thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thanks.","Nick Akins","We\u2019re focus is really on 2016 and the issues around that. Because we certainly want to give some sense of continuous improvement in terms of earnings and be able to really approach that in the right way. So 2017 and 2018 and beyond, we\u2019ll probably have more color on that by the time EEI rolls around in November.","Operator","And next question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, congrats on a good start of the year. ","Brian Tierney","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Lapides","When we think about last year, you had a great first quarter, and you talked about moving some O&M into 2014. And you\u2019ve talked a little bit about doing it this year, although it sounds like there is not as much wiggle room there. One of the other things you did last year is you moved up a couple hundred million dollars of transmission spend into 2014, or you raised your transmission CapEx view, for prompt here. Just curious whether you\u2019re likely to do the same thing this year, given such a strong or healthy start to the year.","Brian Tierney","Michael, a couple of things on that. One is, we had about a $200 million planned and funded to higher transmission spend. We\u2019ve been able to move dollars out of other CapEx buckets that we\u2019ve had into transmission. And that includes both the transmission holdco and the vertically integrated utilities transmission spend. So of that $200 million, we\u2019ve been able to fund about $80 million of that. And then just on the prior question from Ali, if there are to be proceeds from transactions that might happen later this year, the primary place for that to go would be the transmission spend.","Michael Lapides","Yes. And I\u2019m just thinking outside of transactions, because that\u2019s kind of bigger dollars versus where I am focused here. I didn\u2019t know if you are making another increase to expected transmission spend, given a strong first quarter 2015, similar to like what you did in the first quarter of 2014.","Brian Tierney","Not at this point.","Nick Akins","Not at this point. ","Michael Lapides","Yes.","Nick Akins","But just know that we continue to advance our transmission spend. And if conditions wind up that way, we will be happy to do it.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And because when I start looking, Brian, at the balance sheet and your capitalization ratios, they\u2019re getting pretty healthy. They\u2019ve been getting healthy for the last couple of years. But they are now reaching \u2013 I think your FFO to debt is, on a percentage wise, getting at or even better than some of your targets. Just curious about when the health of the balance sheet, regardless of having had such a strong first quarter, enables you to deploy more capital in the transmission maybe a little bit earlier than you thought.","Brian Tierney","Yes, so very good point there, Michael. I think the CapEx that we spent last year, the 4.4 that we spent this year, were predicated on those improving credit metrics. Again, if we were to change the portfolio of businesses that we have, we think we would have even more balance sheet capacity. I think you saw Duke get an upgrade on the sale of its competitive generation business. We would expect a similar actions by the rating agencies if we were to transact going forward, which would give us even more balance sheet capacity. And if and when those things happen, you know where we\u2019re going to be spending those dollars. It\u2019s going to be on that transmission growth story that we have going on.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Last question, just thinking about transmission. We\u2019ve seen some changes come out of the FERC regarding transmission ROEs. We\u2019ve seen a multitude of cases in other RTOs in the Midwest ISO and in ISO New England. We have not seen a lot of activity regarding that in PJM. Just curious for your view on kind of why PJM is one of the few regions where we haven\u2019t seen a lot of Section 206-type cases for ROEs.","Nick Akins","I think you haven\u2019t seen the ROEs out of the realm of reasonableness. So there\u2019s a bandwidth for that. And certainly, I see FERC continuing to encourage the investment in transmission. And so, you see some of these one-off type of cases. And they have their own situations, whether it\u2019s their RTO premium, that kind of thing. And when you look at the aggregated total from a ROE perspective, we\u2019re still within the range of reasonableness, comfortably. So we don\u2019t expect much change, from our perspective.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Betty Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you very much. So I have two questions again, about the merchant power business. Just so we\u2019re clear, assuming that the capacity auction clears at strong levels, would that be a bullish indicator for a possibility of PPAs in Ohio, in a sense that that would allow you guys to prove that those PPAs would be beneficial to rate payers?","Nick Akins","Angie, you bring up a great point, and certainly one that we think about a lot. Because there\u2019s two sides to the equation that are working here. And as you talk about PJM and what FERC can do and the capacity auctions, if the capacity auctions improve considerably, then that may, in fact, have a negative impact on the ability for PPAs. And I am saying negative from our perspective, because the market is saying the value that capacity is going up considerably. So you look at what Ohio is doing. Ohio looks like a long-term PPA customer to us. And typically, long-term PPA customers will enter into contracts when prices are lower so that they can lock in value for customers in the future. ","And my concern is, if the market continues to increase considerably, that we will be looking at investors saying, why are you entering into PPAs with a market going up considerably? And that will be a problem for us. So I think the Ohio Commission, and the state of Ohio, really needs to think about that, in terms of the long-term stability of Ohio and where it\u2019s placed in the right now. Because we\u2019ve demonstrated that the PPAs are a benefit to customers over the long term. And so a decision needs to be made. So to me, I think, in some cases, the race is on. And we have to get this resolved.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And secondly, assuming that you do sign those PPAs for 2,700 megawatts and that similar things happened for synergies assets and potentially other diversified utilities in the state. So how do you think those PPAs are going to impact the value of the remaining 5,000 megawatts that you will be planning to sell on a merchant basis?","Nick Akins","Yes. So the units that are placed in the 2,700 megawatts, they are ones that are still fit well in the market, but they\u2019re probably the most at risk. And Ohio has to look at that from \u2013 we want to keep the generation. We want to keep it running. We want to keep the taxes, the jobs, but there is still a benefit to customers. So the other generation will continue to fit very well into the market. And then from the PPA perspective of generation fleet itself, if it is approved the way we presented it, with a long-term approach that\u2019s essentially life of plant and those kinds of things, it becomes somewhat neutral. Because you have a situation there where it is quasi regulated.","So I think it could wind up being a really good fit, because you would have the certainty around a portion of the portfolio in Ohio. And then Ohio could still take advantage of any market fluctuations that may occur, just like we do with any other portfolio we have. There\u2019s a fixed portion. There\u2019s a variable portion. And I think that\u2019s ultimately best for customers, just like we do fuel.","Angie Storozynski","Very good. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Betty Jo Rozsa","Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Brad, would you please give the replay information. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2015 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the AEP third quarter 2015 earnings call. Once again, AEP is reporting a strong quarter performance driven by the strength of our regulated utilities in our transmission business. And as a result, we are also increasing our 2015 guidance as well. For the third quarter 2015, AEP is reporting GAAP and operating earnings of $1.06 per share compared with $1.01 per share for third quarter 2014. This brings 2015 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.22 per share and $3.21 per share respectively compared with 2014 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings of $2.95 per share. With the positive quarterly and year-to-date results in hand, AEP is increasing our 2015 guidance range from $3.50 to $3.65 per share to $3.67 to $3.77 per share and reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate.","As you already know the Board of AEP increased the dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 per share representing a 5.7% increase on annualized basis indicating once again confidence in the direction we are taking to become the next premium regulated utility, the tag line we used at last year\u2019s EEI Financial Conference. While load was also up in all three sectors, residential, commercial and industrial, the third quarter year-on-year, we continue to analyze the makeup of load and margins of each sector as Brian will discuss in more detail later.","Our employees focused on continuous improvement and culture initiatives have been instrumental in not only achieving our earnings objectives, but redesigning our lines of businesses for future success. Lien activities continue to progress across the enterprise. This has been a three-year effort of what is now over 65 initial 3 to 4 months deployment efforts generating over 20,000 ideas from employees to improve efficiency and deliver better outcomes. We are in the process of finishing up the few remaining deployments and we will begin the process of ensuring the sustainability of the cultural and process-related changes that enable continuous improvement. This is because of primarily these efforts along with investment growth in the regulated companies and transmission as well as the outcomes from the PJM supplemental auctions that have improved our confidence regarding 2016, more to come on that in November, the EEI Financial Conference.","As you know, we announced the sale of AEP River Operations to American Commercial lines for approximately $550 million plus the assumption of capital lease obligations of approximately $235 million. We are very pleased with the outcome from the process we began back in March to sell River Ops at a fair price to a company we truly believe understands what it takes to be successful on the River. AEP will receive about $400 million in net cash proceeds to invest in our regulated businesses. We have followed through the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance and don\u2019t expect any delays. So, we should close in November. I do want to take the opportunity to recognize and thank the entire River Operations management and the operations team for their continued emphasis on providing value to AEP and its customers over the years. This sale represents a step towards the desired direction of delivering customer and shareholder value as a regulated utility company.","The PPA story in Ohio continues to develop with ongoing hearings that are occurring and should conclude here very quickly. We don\u2019t know the outcome yet, but AEP is actively pursuing discussions with various parties in the case to ultimately drive to a solution that makes sense for AEP, its customers and other stakeholders. We believe the PUCO should be able to render a decision sometime before the end of the year. Because we believe the timeframe for decision is in hand, this will have a direct bearing on AEP\u2019s ultimate decision regarding long-term PPA coverage generation assets within our ongoing strategic evaluation process regarding the unregulated generation in Ohio. The PPA arrangements are important for the security of supply and pricing for Ohio customers and will provide an important segment regarding future investments in Ohio. We will complete our review with the Board as expeditiously as possible and as we deal with such issues that you all continue to ask about concerning strategic options, sale proceeds, user proceeds, potential dilutions, share buybacks, etcetera, fully expect not only the PPA decision, but the broader strategic decisions to be we answered in early 2016.","AEP continues to work with each of our states regarding the clean power plant. We believe our state should follow initial plans with the EPA by September of next year to ensure the state maintains ownership and the development of resource plants that makes sense for their particular jurisdictions. AEP in the industry needs clarity regarding investment decisions in new resources and will continue to work with the space to develop integrated resource plans that comport with the requirements of these ultimate state plans.","During the last quarter, you may have seen AEP\u2019s investment in Greensmith, an energy storage integration platform company and our continued development of utility-scale solar in Indiana and Michigan as well as our relationships with the universities to define energy solutions such as rooftop and utility-scale solar along with battery technologies. These investments in combination with our bold technology in transmission and other distributor-related investments will move us toward a cleaner, more balanced energy portfolio that is focused on the quality of service to our customers. You will hear more about this during the EEI in November as well.","Now, moving to what I usually call the equalizer chart of ROEs by operating unit. Note that the overall ROE has improved to 9.4% from 9.1% from last quarter. As I go through the state, I will mention what\u2019s going on in each of one of those, so you can have some sort of a trim line on what to see in the future. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE forecasted.","For APCO, Virginia earnings are expected to remain study during the period because of the previous legislation and the rate freezes in effect. For West Virginia, we had recently the rate case order that should address the weak returns there that was where our issue was and the APCO jurisdictions. The order authorized rate increase of 99 million with an authorized ROE of 9.75. Rates were implemented in June of 2015. So we expect to see higher ROEs for APCO for the balance of the year.","Kentucky, I know that looks a little strange to you. We did know what to do when the return for the quarter was actually negative 0.1%. It almost looks like last year we probably should have just put the Kentucky investment into amateurs, but just understand that we did recently get through a rate case there and we expected to continue to improve. And that was part of the strategic decisions we made previously about what gets included in rate cases and the timing associated with them. So we expect Kentucky to move up to 4% by the end of the year. And then by mid-year, it will be \u2013 mid-year \u201816 it will be back in the 8% to 9% range. So, while we have this short-term probation of lower ROEs, we expect that to improve.","For I&M, I&M continues to be on track to grow earnings and achieve its authorized ROE range, which is around 10.2%. I&M had a good third quarter as it continues to execute major capital investment programs in generation Rockport SCR, solar and the nuclear lifecycle management along with PJM transmission-related projects. PSO, its ROE is about the same as last quarter. And we continue to progress there through the rate case process. Base rate case was filed in July \u201815 to recover generation, environmental control investments and cost increases since the last base rate case. We expect new rates to be put in place by first quarter of 2016.","SWEPCO transmission costs recovery in Texas in the form of the rate true-up in Louisiana as well as a true up and increase in wholesale customer rates were the primary drivers for SWEPCO ROE improvement. Although, we continue to see it under pressure, because of the Arkansas portion, what we believe is the Arkansas portion of Turk that we ultimately will be looking for in terms of a retail solution, but the timing has yet to be determined. For AEP Texas, we expect the ROE in AEP Texas will continue to decline through 2015 as the distribution CapEx increases are put in place. And we are looking \u2013 presently looking at alternatives for addressing the ROEs coming down in that jurisdiction either through distribution costs recovery or DCRF or rate case, but we are still looking at those options. AEP Transmission Holdco, its Holdco return of 11.3% is in line with the authorized return. So that keeps plugging along and we keep investing more and more in transmission.","So with all that said, as we look at the accomplishments of the third quarter and year-to-date, it should be instructive as to what the future holds for AEP. I am reminded that yesterday, October 21, 2015, was Back to the Future Day, the day that Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown Time Travel into the future from the 1989 sequel to back to the future. When we look back at 1989 and where we are today, during that time AEP has reduced SO2 emissions by over 80%, NOx emissions by over 80%, mercury emissions by over 54% and CO2 emissions since 2005 levels of 15%. More recently, we have deployed battery storage technologies, the bold transmission line, utility and rooftop solar, and now embark on the infrastructure of the future to define a better customer experience.","These are all examples of back to the future\u2019s version of hoverboards and self-time sneakers, but all of this is to say that we believe AEP is uniquely positioned both financially and culturally to be successful during this huge transition that is occurring within our industry. We will continue to focus on infrastructure development, technology and resources of the future and a renewed focus on the customer experience. Our investors expect consistency in quality of earnings and dividend growth, so any decision we make should be viewed through the lens of being the next premium regulated utility.","Now I will turn it over to Brian.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 5 with a review of the major drivers affecting the earnings comparison for the quarter. This year\u2019s third quarter operating earnings were $1.06 per share or $521 million compared to $1.01 per share or $493 million last year. This solid performance was driven by our regulated businesses, which were all at or above last year\u2019s prior results. With that background let\u2019s review the major earnings drivers by segment.","Earnings per share for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.56, up $0.11 from last year. Key drivers in the quarterly comparison included rate changes, which added $0.09 per share and are related to the recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. Warmer temperatures in 2015 also contributed significantly to the earnings adding $0.07 per share. Cooling degree days were 25% higher in the east and 18% higher in our western service areas. Margins from normalized load were off $0.03 per share for the quarter due to lower residential sales and a slight decline in the average realization. Off system sales were down $0.03 per share primarily due to much lower power prices this year.","O&M expense was higher than the prior period adversely affecting the quarter by $0.03 per share mostly due to the higher employee-related costs. This segment did benefit from higher AFUDC as a result of our capital spending program adding $0.01 per share and lower state and federal income taxes contributed $0.03. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 from last year. The primary driver was an unfavorable regulatory provision recorded last year that was not repeated in 2015, which contributed $0.04 per share for the quarter. The remaining other variances were relatively small, including rate changes in Ohio and weather in Texas each adding a $0.01 versus last year and these are offset by lower off system sales and higher O&M.","The Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.09 per share for the quarter, up $3 million over last year. We remain on track to meet our guidance level for this segment for the year. Year-over-year, the Transco\u2019s net plant grew by approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 51%. The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.19 per share off $0.05 from the third quarter of last year. We are beginning to see the adverse effect of lower Ohio capacity revenue and earnings partially offset by lower O&M. AEP River Operations declined $0.01 per share and corporate and other lost $0.02 per share, down $0.04 from last year, primarily due to higher O&M and franchise taxes.","On Slide 6, we have a view of year-to-date operating earnings compared to last year. Operating earnings for the year-to-date periods stand at $3.21 per share or $1.6 billion compared to last year\u2019s $2.95 per share or $1.4 billion. Similar to the quarterly comparison, growth from our regulated businesses are driving the improved results with the competitive businesses performing at or below last year. Consistent with our original guidance for 2015, our Vertically Integrated and Transmission Holdco segments are realizing strong growth driven by our continued capital investment in rate base and execution of our regulatory plans. Favorable weather also contributed to year-over-year earnings growth.","As expected, we are seeing a decline in year-to-year earnings in our competitive generation business, reflecting the loss of capacity revenue, which was tempered by lower O&M and the performance of our commercial and retail teams taking advantage of market opportunities. The combination of all our businesses allowed us to exceed last year\u2019s results by $0.26 per share. These strong results and our confidence in our plan for the remainder of the year allow us to raise and narrow the operating earnings guidance range to $3.67 per share to $3.77 per share.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at Slide 11 \u2013 I am sorry, it\u2019s Slide 7 to review the normalized load performance for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, you see that our load increased by 0.09% for the quarter with growth spread across all major retail classes. This brings our year-to-date normalized load in line with last year. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales grew by 0.08% compared to last year. The growth in residential sales is coming from a mix of customer and usage growth. Most of the customer growth is happening in our Western territory, especially Texas, where residential counts are up 1.2% versus last year. The growth in residential usage is coming from Ohio, where we saw the strongest growth in employment for the quarter.","Year-to-date, residential sales are down 1.1% versus last year, but this is mostly caused by the weak normalized growth reported in the first quarter and remember that had the impacts from last year\u2019s Polar Vortex in that as well. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were up 1.3% for the quarter. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio, which is consistent with the economic indicators we will discuss in more detail later.","Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales grew at 0.07% compared to last year. We continue to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas related sectors despite the decline in oil prices, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. I would like to point out that most of our load growth for the quarter and year-to-date period is coming from our T&D utilities segment where we only recovered the wires portion in our rates. Unfortunately, normalized sales are down 0.08% in our Vertically Integrated Utilities where we recovered the full bundled rate. This means even though our normalized load is similar to last year, we lost approximately $0.08 for the year due to the mix of our sales by segment and class.","With that, let\u2019s review the most economic data for AEP service territory on Slide 8. Starting with GDP, you can see that the estimated 1.6% growth for the AEP service area is about 0.5% less than the estimated growth for the U.S. This is not surprising considering that the impact of falling oil prices, especially in our Western footprint. While the nation benefits from lower fuel prices, the regional economies supporting the shale plays are experiencing the direct impact of lost jobs. For example, there are number of metro areas like Shreveport, Tulsa and Abilene that have fewer people working today than they did at the start of the year.","The bottom left quadrant shows that the job market within AEP\u2019s service area is holding steady, but grew at half the pace of the U.S. Job growth within AEP\u2019s Eastern territory exceeded the Western service area for the first time since 2011. The sectors showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest employment decline this quarter is natural resources and mining. This is no surprise given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening in AEP\u2019s footprint. Given the impact lower energy prices are having on a regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, we continue to see significant load increases in the parts of our service area located near major shale formations as illustrated in the upper left chart. We are still seeing nearly 10% growth in our sales to the oil and gas sectors this quarter, despite oil prices being down 50% from last year, rig counts being down nearly 60% and the fact that there are over 10,000 fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of last year. The upper right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads were spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus shale regions.","If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components, as shown in the bottom left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the midstream pipeline transportation sector, which grew by over 33% over last year. This was mostly due to the expanding natural gas infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas. Our upstream oil and gas extraction sales were up nearly 8%, while downstream petroleum and coal product sales declined by eight-tenths of a percent. We still have a large number of new oil and gas related expansion expected to come online over the next 18 months that will drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. In contrast to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper left chart show the sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 3.1% in the third quarter. In fact, through September, half of our top 10 industrial sectors were down from last year\u2019s results. One industry clearly affected by the low energy prices is the mining sector where sales were down 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year.","On a lighter note, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by nearly 1% this quarter and is now at a healthy 53.4%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.7 times and 21.6%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding declined a bit this quarter dropping from fully funded last quarter to 97% this quarter. This is a result of declining equity values and a slight decrease in interest rates. Our pension assets are now weighted to 60% in duration matching fixed income securities with the balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance as we approach full funding late last year. Our OPEB obligations remain fully funded at 112%. Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.6 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018.","Our treasury group was active during the quarter taking advantage of the low cost of that capital. First in August, Texas North accessed the market for a $125 million of senior private placement notes. The offering utilized that the late funding structure and realized the weighted average life of issuance of 13.4 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.04%. Secondly, in September, the Treasury Group and Texas Central management accessed the market for $250 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 3.85%. Over the past two years, the Treasury Group has been able to lower AEP\u2019s weighted average cost of debt to 4.64%. We are well positioned as we approach 2016, where we have a manageable debt maturity stack of slightly more than $1 billion.","Finally, before we turn the call over to your questions, let me review on Slide 11 some of the information that we will be providing at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference. We will confirm our previously stated 4% to 6% growth rate, which assumes the sale of River Operations and the retention of the other businesses in AEP\u2019s portfolio. We will provide an updated operating earnings guidance range for 2016 with detail by segment. As in the past, our growth rate is predicated on our continued investment in our regulated properties. So, we will provide a capital expenditure plan for the next three years, details on transmission and utility investment opportunities, and a 3-year financing plan for getting it all done. We will also have some slides detailing our generation fleet transformation over the past several years as Nick just described. These slides will demonstrate how AEP has invested over $8 billion to transform the fleet and the resulting dramatic reductions and emissions that this investment has enabled. This story is becoming increasingly important to a certain class of investors and we believe AEP has a great story to tell.","Finally, we will surely be talking about any developments in both the Ohio PPAs and the strategic review of our competitive generation business. With that preview for the future, let me now turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning guys.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers","You guys made a great progress on the equalizer chart as far as improving the overall earned ROEs. How much more room we thought about \u201816 given the rate cases you see coming? Where do you see the \u201816 ROE headed and how much more improvement do you need in ROE to be able to hit the 4% to 6% growth rate?","Nick Akins","Yes. I think it\u2019s going to continue to improve, Dan. We are probably on the order of 9.6% to 10% in that range for 2016. So, it will continue to improve overall. And then with Kentucky coming up, that\u2019s helpful, although Kentucky is pretty small in the overall comparison, but the others are doing quite well.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And I guess preemptive on the Ohio generation side, but given the weakness of the power stocks in the IPP sector, is there a market of buyers still sitting out there who will be willing to transact on your assets right now or are market conditions potentially going to slow down maybe the year since you are making a decision on those assets?","Nick Akins","Yes, I think there is still a set of bars out there. It\u2019s just \u2013 it certainly goes with the question whether spend option is \u2013 while it\u2019s still on the table, it\u2019s more difficult, because you have the paper involved with those companies, but for sale, there is still parties out there and some of the recent transactions have shown that.","Dan Eggers","And I guess just one last question, when you guys look at the load trends going on right now, how was the residential versus commercial trends having there in which guys expect to see for load growth next year?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, commercial continues to improve math like that\u2019s probably the bright spot of the portfolio. And you have these cycles that change as we go along in the residential. That\u2019s going up and down the last few quarters and it really does drive this view that we need the economy there really start picking up back, particularly from the energy policy perspective if we start exporting or if we continue a build out of the economy that\u2019s focused on energy than our economy will pickup as well. So we are getting some benefits from auto manufacturing and that kind of thing. But primary metals on the world market, mining those kinds of activities are certainly having an impact. So I mean we have been in sort of a strange period for several quarters and actually years now. And we obviously need to get the economy moving again from an energy perspective.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Nick Akins","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","Couple of questions, first the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration, is that still off the midpoint of the original 2014 guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 a share?","Nick Akins","Yes, it is.","Greg Gordon","Okay, great figures. You earned $3.43 in \u201814 and this year you are at the new midpoint you are going to earn $3.73 even if that weather normalize that, that\u2019s $3.65. So now withstand the deceleration in load growth trends that you are experiencing, one would presume you are doing very well relative to that aspiration. So I have to ask, does that aspiration build in the expectation that there will be some dilution from the sale of generation assets, which gets offset over time as you redeploy that capital into the transmission?","Nick Akins","Go ahead, Brian.","Brian Tierney","Greg that assumes the business as usual case that we continue to own the properties that we do today with the exception of river operations. And we will do for you at EEI like we do the normal waterfall stair step between 2015 and what we anticipate \u201816 to be. In addition to weather, which if you look across all our businesses is probably closer to $0.12. We have had things like inception gains at generation and marketing that are about $0.06. We have had the benefit from the sale of some plants and reducing ALO obligations that\u2019s another $0.06. So you can pretty easily do a stair step that would take off that $3.72 about $0.24 for things that we don\u2019t anticipate to be recurring parts of our business.","Greg Gordon","Okay, that was addressing my question. I appreciate that.","Nick Akins","Yes. Greg, I think you have to sort of look at like in the previous quarters we have been talking about working to drive to try to get to a solution for 2016. And now we move to confident about 2016.","Greg Gordon","Certainly, you have been taking into account the things you just articulated looking back at your aspiration at the beginning of \u201814 you are doing very well.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Greg Gordon","The second question is with regard to the timeline for getting an answer from Ohio on whether or not you will be able to contact a portion of that fleet and whether that is the gating factor for concluding an asset sale or whether there is a deadline at which you would move on to the asset sale and not wait around for sort of in an open ended process?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, it won\u2019t negate the discussion. I think really what matters here is as we get through the process with Ohio by the end of the year we have a result that says these particular units are going to be covered by a long-term PPA. Then that says that we are sort of ambivalent whether assuming the PPA addresses our concerns as certainly being long-term. We have lots of plan out there and as well some of the other provisions to ensure that we are able to make it quasi regulated, then we are somewhat ambivalent as to whether we hold those units or not. And I think it certainly bodes well for our ability to hold on those units and still be a regulated utility for the remaining assets that aren\u2019t covered by the PPA. There is still a process ongoing. And so we will go through this. And as I said earlier, our Board has been I mean for the last 2 years as you know, we have been going through this with our Board and the PPA because originally we thought it may be later for decision. No one knew, because we didn\u2019t have the schedule. We are concerned by that and we weren\u2019t going to wait for it. And now there is a scheduled employees. There is hearings that have occurred and we will conclude here pretty soon. We will have a result pretty soon and the PPA is very, very important to our standing in Ohio overall and whether we keep that portion of the generation or not, but it doesn\u2019t change the objectivity and the measure of approach that we are using to go through this process to ensure that we are making the right decisions for our shareholders and so, because we get a PPA, it doesn\u2019t mean certainly that the process is off for any of the remaining generation that\u2019s not covered by that type of PPA.","So, we are looking at this very straightforward and we have been very consistent in our discussions. I know last quarter or previous quarter we were saying that we were after the capacity options, the capacity performance supplemental options that we would know and understand a lot more we do. We were assuming that it was a never ending approach associated with getting a PPA resolved and it appears that the Ohio Commission has taken this on seriously and are moving forward with determining where their solution would be. And so we are going to go through that process, fully understand it. And by first quarter next year, our Board will certainly know all the ins and outs of the issues that we are dealing with and then we will move forward.","Greg Gordon","Great. Is there with the potential there has been chatter about the potential for substantive settlement talks on the \u2013 in the contract discussions, is that going on or not?","Nick Akins","You are talking about the PPAs?","Greg Gordon","The PPAs, yes.","Nick Akins","Well, certainly there has been a lot of chatter and a lot of discussion with multiple parties in this case. And it\u2019s a complex issue and certainly we continue to have conversations and certainly FE can speak for themselves, but we both have the firm belief that there needs to be some kind of support for this generation in Ohio and it\u2019s really a discussion around what those mechanisms would look like. And so we will continue in discussions with the parties. I will stop there.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you guys. Take care.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Crowdell","Hey, good morning. I didn\u2019t know you guys are such back to the future fans, but\u2026.","Nick Akins","Yes, we all remember that. Some of us do anyway. I am probably talking to some people that don\u2019t even remember us.","Anthony Crowdell","If we wanted to [indiscernible] at EEI, Nick, I am okay with it, but\u2026","Nick Akins","Well, you don\u2019t want to happen to think about that, when I was talking about the bold line, boldly going where no man has gone before.","Anthony Crowdell","Just great answer as was my question, but just quickly when do you think on the PPA process if we don\u2019t reach a settlement or whatever of fully \u2013 if we end up going on fully litigated track, when do you guys expect that to be finished?","Nick Akins","Well, so if it\u2019s fully litigated we still expect to get in order by the end of the year. And that\u2019s now fully litigated means, I mean obviously there will still be, I am sure, there will be appeals and all that kind of stuff, but we are actually focusing on the commission order itself, because that really tells us where the policymaking decision in the state is moving towards. And so we certainly believe that will occur before the end of the year.","Anthony Crowdell","Do you think such a big issue like this for Ohio with giving a PPA or entering into PPA, do you think the appeals process would be I guess lessened if you do get a fully litigated order meaning on the parties that are also getting a litigated order just so that the appeals process is maybe less shorter or the record is stronger versus the settlement?","Nick Akins","Yes. Certainly, I think it depends on what the order looks like, but certainly the \u2013 I mean, the commission certainly has taken a deliberative approach to this. And we have certainly done a lot of analysis along with others you participate in hearings about can a PPA be used. We feel really good about where we stand from a legal perspective going forward. I think the real issue is the commission needs to come out with an order that comports with the discussions that occurred relative to the PPA. I mean \u2013 so if there is deviation from that in some fashion maybe you could be open yourself up to more substantial appeals. But we have given the recipe, the recipe is there. And certainly, it drives a positive solution for the customers, for Ohio and the commission certainly has the track record to be able to put that kind of thing in place that holds up.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","Hi, thanks so much for taking my call.","Nick Akins","Thanks.","Praful Mehta","So my key question was on generation business and as we look at it from an EBITDA perspective year-to-date for the generation business, you have already achieved about $725 million of EBITDA, relative to guidance midpoint of about $5.90 for 2015. So just wanted to understand more long-term like is this more specific things that have happened in 2015 that are driving 2015 EBITDA to be higher, but longer term your guidance stays consistent?","Nick Akins","Praful, a couple of things going on there, one is for the first half of the year we still had some considerable capacity revenues coming from Ohio, that dropped off in May and we will be experiencing that negative impact through the balance of the year. So that\u2019s something that on an annualized basis you need to factor that out of the business going forward. We also had two other pieces that contributed to the general marketing results this year that we don\u2019t think you need \u2013 you can consider as regular ongoing items. One is we have had inception gains of about $0.06 per share. And the other is we have had reductions in liabilities that on a positive way flow through O&M associated with the sales of two plants. One is Muskingum River and the other is co-empowerment that we were able to sell. The combination of those two items is another $0.06. So there are some things that you need to factor out if you are going to annualize that business on a go forward looking basis.","Praful Mehta","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then finally just a key question on Ohio, I heard your points around the ESP and the PPA, I guess I am just trying to understand from a long-term perspective, I get the message that if it\u2019s long-term, it\u2019s a different answer or you are at least in different between sale versus keeping it. What defines long-term is it 7 years long-term enough if we don\u2019t get the full \u201815, at what point do you say, I actually do have a difference between keeping the business versus selling?","Nick Akins","Certainly, I don\u2019t want to get into that too much, because \u2013 long-term, to us, I mean we have followed for the life of plant. And I will just say this, the term has to be substantial, because we have to have a feeling that we can invest and with the large capital investments that we make in generation, we need to know that we can do that and be secure from a future perspective. So when I look at even for our FERC wholesale contracts, we have had contracts that are 10 years, 15 years. We have had same customers for 75 years. So when we talk about long-term, it has to be substantial enough for us to make that kind of investment. And so I am not going to say an actual number at this point, because we have lot of plants sitting out there and that\u2019s what we believe what it takes. And we will wait and see what it wants up being. But I can tell you this, 3 years, which is the length of the capacity deal in PJM that was a 3-year capacity market, that\u2019s not long enough. And that\u2019s a problem within PJM and the state has an opportunity to fix that.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Thank you so much.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson","Hi, how are you doing?","Nick Akins","Fine.","Paul Patterson","I just want to follow up I guess on that question about the generation business in the asset retirement obligation. And I saw that we are cutting out a little bit. On Slide 22, I noticed this that there was a $62 million benefit. And just to make sure. I understood that, a lot of that has to do with the asset retirement obligation going away through it, because of some plant sales. And for the most part, you don\u2019t see that recurring is that correct?","Nick Akins","Yes. We had reserved asset retirement obligations that ended up being higher than what we were able to realize by selling the plant to a third-party. So, we were able to get the third-party to take those obligations for less than what we had recorded on the books and that allowed us to flow the difference between what we had recorded through O&M. And we have gone back now and checked the remaining plants both from an engineering standpoint and from a marketing standpoint \u2013 from a market standpoint, those values that we have recorded the AROs at and we believe those values to be accurate as they are in the books today.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just with respect to the AEP Dayton ATC liquidations, which seemed to be sort of leveling off, how should we think about how they actually impacted year-to-date earnings in generation and marketing and how do you see the outlook for those in 2016?","Nick Akins","We think those prices are going to continue to be under pressure, but I will say this, Paul, and we have talked about this before. We do have, as we go into a year, significant component of that generation is hedged. So, for the third quarter of this year, we are at about 60% of the margins in megawatt hours. We are hedged going into that period. So, we will have similar amounts hedged going forward in 2016. So for two things, one, we will be able to take advantage of prices that they do recover and we do see them under pressure right now in 2016, but also if we were to have unit outages or increase load from our hedges, we wouldn\u2019t be subject to market pricing for that as well.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. And then back to Ohio in the PPA situation, I mean, take this with a great install, but just over the \u2013 with the outcome if you thought in terms of settlement versus fully litigated, what would you say the odds are that it would be settled as opposed to fully litigated?","Nick Akins","I wish I could answer that at this point. There is a lot of context within discussions and there is multiple aspects. There is not just the units that are the generation that\u2019s within a PPA, but really what\u2019s the total answer for Ohio. And I even think about it from a clean power plant perspective. The state of Ohio needs to have some framework for foundation of a transition with base load generation that allows it to make plans associated with ultimate retirements of that generation and replacement with new resources that are put in place. And all incremental resources are either going to be natural gas renewables, certainly, efficiencies regarded the grid itself. Those are the kinds of investments that I think can really drive Ohio to a more balanced energy future that mitigates lot of risk for consumers. And so what we are talking about here is the foundation that we provided for a transition and that\u2019s clearly important. And I think it should be important to the governor, it should be important to the policymakers in the state. And if you drive that kind of solution, you could wind up at a much better place than you would otherwise. And so I know a several lot other than what the direct question you are asking, what\u2019s the percentage of chances, but I think I am going to those kinds of things that should and will be discussed in the framework of supporting a PPA top arrangement.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And just I gathered from your previous comments that you feel pretty confident that we will get a decision one way or the other by the end of the year that we just want to make sure that as you know sometimes regulators whatever there is an issue that\u2019s got some whatever \u2013 a lot of speculation, etcetera associated within this delay, default what I am saying. I mean you don\u2019t get the feeling that that you feel pretty confident am I wrong, tell me if I am wrong that you feel that this is very likely to be settled one way or the other by the end of the year?","Nick Akins","I think, it will. There is \u2013 it certainly should be settled by the end of the year. And I think goes the settlement route. Then you have to think about okay, how do you argue about the settlement, that kind of stuff and who is involved and all that kind of stuff. If you litigate it, well, the commission needs to make a decision. I am really focused on making sure we drive to a solution as quickly as possible. And this has been 2 years by the way. The first case, it was filed by APE and then FirstEnergy followed up. I think both were certainly, check and speak for them self, but both companies need to get on with the investment and the decisions that need to be made relative to these assets. And I certainly believe there is recognition by the commission that they do need to make this decision.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Akins","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning. So perhaps just to follow-up a little bit of detail from the last question, and again I hate if you will go too much. Is there a minimum tenure that that defines getting a long-term solution for a PPA, I know it\u2019s a transient question, but kind of how do you think about that?","Nick Akins","Minimum tenure would be a long time. I just want to make sure that everyone understands that if regardless of the solution here, if there is a PPA, there is sort of two parts of the gate here. One is that the commission approves the PPA. The second is what does the PPA look like? And AEP has been very out-front and very focused and measured in our discussion about this to say that our expectation is a long-term PPA, one that goes past a 3-year ESP cycle or has adjustment mechanisms or all that kind of stuff. We want to make sure that we have a long-term PPA that we can depend on and that we can actually make the investments we need to make. So minimum is long-term.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Very clear now. Secondly, sort of a bigger picture question, when you think about CPP, obviously we got that finalized recently, how are you thinking about coordination between the various states that you have operations in T&D utilities fully integrated, when do you think you start to get clarity about what needs to happen in each of those states through the filing process, etcetera. I mean and perhaps to add to that, do you have or do you need legislative approval in any state to kick off the CPP compliance?","Nick Akins","No, I think we want to make sure that the commissions are certainly involved to this. Now the states are going to take their own approach. I mean, they may litigate. I am sure, some states will litigate it. And \u2013 but that could be done in parallel. Our message is regardless of what you decide to do. You really need to work with us on developing a state implementation plan, because that\u2019s the only way that not only can a state have its own approach. And we keep in mind PPA did allow the states to say, okay, come back with a plan and tell us what the reliability implications are. Because I believe that when the states look at their plans and they go through with the process that needs to occur and if there are reliability implications, they are in a much better position to have a plan and the factual information to support that. So \u2013 and then who knows what administration changes and all that occurs along the way. But you are also in a much better position to negotiate relative to your own state implementation plan as opposed to one size fits all federal plan that it\u2019s very difficult for one state to change. So this is why we are sort of staying out of the arguments whether states and attorney generals and all that get involved from that perspective, from the litigation perspective. We want to make sure that the states continue to move forward. And for us, states that do work with us on developing these plans will be in a much better position, because every filing we make relative to our resource plan, integrated resource plan or other types of plans, we will be able to comport with what the state really wants to see. That maybe based upon their own unique views of where \u2013 how they want to approach this. So, we want to be part of that and be part of that discussion. We want to be able to drive that discussion, because we have a lot of factual information that I think the states will benefit from.","We have already started those discussions and we will continue with that dialogue for states that just refuse to do a plan, will continue to look at the clean energy economy of the future and the technology of the future and we will continue to advance that within the resource plans that we have. So, we just want to make sure we have answers to the questions of where states preferences are in terms of resources if they want to move forward with and that were there to do it. And so that\u2019s where we are at. And I believe the states, obviously, have to make their own decisions relative to this, but we are working with the state EPAs and the state public utility commissions. As far as legislation is concerned, we believe each individual state is unique from that perspective, but we will be working with the commissions and we will be making our voice known in terms of where we think it should go in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning. We definitely need more Sci-Fi movie references on earnings calls. So, thank you for that.","Nick Akins","Okay, we will work on it.","Stephen Byrd","So, most of my questions have been addressed. Just had to or wanted to discuss transmission has always been a good area of growth for you and you are in a pretty strong financial position. I wondered if you could just comment on how bullish you are in terms of finding additional transmission growth opportunities and to the extent that you do see more opportunities, could you talk at a high level at the types of transmission opportunities that you see out there?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, we continue to have, I mean, like I said, I think I said last quarter, there is well over 2,000 projects that we are working on today. We have other projects that are waiting for capital and we constantly are reviewing the capital situation that occurs if we wind up with bonus depreciation or other opportunities that we could advance capital. And actually in anticipation of the sale of River ops, we started the transmission spend last quarter when we raised the transmission in anticipation of that, so that we wouldn\u2019t have the delay in terms of the earnings power of transmission associated with that. So, we are constantly looking at ways to do that. You are going to hear more about that at the EEI. So \u2013 and we will have more to say about and I think Brian was talking about the capital plans for the future. We will have more to say about that.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And then just thinking about you had mentioned utility-scale solar investments, when you look across your territories and you think the ability to actually invest capital versus entrants at PPAs. Could you talk at a high level in terms of the regulatory landscape for the decision or preference between direct investment versus being an off-taker?","Nick Akins","Yes. We historically have been an off-taker of renewables. We have like over 2,000 megawatts of wind power little tired of others taking credit for wind power when they wouldn\u2019t exist without the PPAs that exist from AEP. So, we are going to be obviously much more outspoken about what we are doing relative to PPAs. But also from an investment perspective, we believe for utility-scale solar we should invest in that, because it is a resource of the future and we have very good operations maintenance and project management expertise that we believe we have something to bring to the table in terms of efficiencies associated with that. So, when we talk to our regulatory jurisdictions, remember, our regulatory jurisdictions are sort of on the cusp of dealing with these kinds of situations. So for us, when we follow resource plan, you are going to see some portion natural gas, you are going to see utility scale solar and you are going to see other grid top efficiency technologies to put in place whether it\u2019s energy storage, whether it\u2019s integrated volt\/VAR control, information system deployment, advanced metering, those kinds of things will be key to our future. And that\u2019s something that we are very focused on. So we have transmission. Transmission is a great opportunity for us, because it\u2019s a large scale system that needs refurbishment, so as distribution. Distribution is a great opportunity for us. But even the build out of distributed generation, particularly this type of utility scale, we know where to place it on the system. It could be part of a resource plan that\u2019s filed with commissions. And we are in the best position to build and own that type of generation.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, that\u2019s great color. Thank you very much.","Nick Akins","The other thing just to add on to that, the other thing that we are doing is we are focused also on PPA arrangements with customers \u2013 directly with customers. And we have done that in some respects with the Ohio State University, with Denison University and others. And as long as we have \u2013 again a long-term PPA to back up supply provisions for energy storage, for utility scale solar, for rooftop solar, we will do it. And so that\u2019s why I say, AEP has a very firm foundation. We are not having to spend large amounts of capital on environmental equipment like we spent $8.2 billion that Brian mentioned earlier. We are about done with that. And we have a real opportunity to advance this company in the future from a new age energy supply perspective.","Stephen Byrd","Great. Thanks very much.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Nick Akins","Good morning Hugh.","Hugh Wynne","Good morning. I had a question about the AEP Transmission Holdco. You have had a very good result year-to-date, cents up \u2013 earnings up $0.07 off of 2015 base 30. But third quarter had a uncharacteristically poor result with a sort of flat earnings year-over-year. And I was wondering if you could perhaps explain a little bit what happened if there are any implications for the future?","Nick Akins","So, we had a one-time blip there, Hugh, related to O&M. ETP, we had a cross arm issue from some of the build out that we had to do there and we had to spend some dollars to address that physical issue. We don\u2019t anticipate that to be a recurring item. And we believe there was a blip for the quarter and we will be able to get back on track for the end of the year.","Hugh Wynne","Okay. And then if I could just quickly following up on the prior question on the Clean Power Plan. Is there a form of regulation or a structure of regulation that you are trying to push your states to consider or are you happy to work with states on their individual objectives even if those are taking materially different structures to regulatory approaches?","Nick Akins","Yes. I think we are willing to work with the states on their own individual unique circumstances. And we will be working in that way. Now, what we are looking at is we would rather see and this is so attentive for us because we are still looking at a mass-based approach, because that\u2019s more amicable to trading within states. But we got to have the state solutions before we really understand how important the trading aspects are going to be, but we believe we are better off of the mass-based approach.","Hugh Wynne","Is that a view that your other CEOs share or is that a subject to debate?","Nick Akins","Yes. You would have to talk to them. Their states may be in different places. I know, California obviously is in a different place and \u2013 but it will be unique to each individual region of the country, I believe and really what kind of resources that you are transitioning from within the states as well.","Hugh Wynne","Great, alright and I appreciate that insight. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul Ridzon","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but can you remind us what your indicative guidance for \u201816 was?","Nick Akins","It was 3.45 to 3.85.","Paul Ridzon","And any time on how you feel about where in that range things are looking?","Nick Akins","We will be updating that at EEI in a couple of weeks.","Paul Ridzon","And given that, I guess, the decision of what to do with the Ohio generation is going to be a big driver of \u201816, how you handle that in guidance?","Nick Akins","Yes, that\u2019s what Brian said earlier that the forecast for 2016 and the guidance that we will give in November will still include those generation resources. It\u2019s not an assumption that we are going to continue to own. And I will be careful with that. What it does say is that\u2019s what we know today and so we will plan for 2016 with that assumption. And if something does happen first quarter or whenever a transaction is actually completed, then we will have to re-benchmark and adjust.","Paul Ridzon","And you indicated you expect oil and gas to expand through \u201816, are there any particular regions where you are driving that expansion?","Brian Tierney","Yes, it\u2019s all shale related, Paul. So, it\u2019s Texas, in particular, and then West Virginia and Ohio.","Nick Akins","Yes, keep in mind while the rig count is not going up, the electric load is and that\u2019s because there is a lot of consolidation that\u2019s occurring and efficiencies around compressor load that continues to get added. So, just sort of de-link what rig counts doing versus what the electric load itself is doing.","Paul Ridzon","Basically, we are behind the curve on the development of the infrastructure to move the gas out and that\u2019s going to continue through \u201816?","Nick Akins","That\u2019s right.","Paul Ridzon","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","I know we will touch on 2016 at EEI, but just under a scenario where you retain the approximate 3 gigawatts under a PPA and you sell the remaining 5-gig, does that scenario necessarily have to lend itself to dilution or do you have enough levers to pull IE or 2000 plus power transmission projects or even buybacks to mitigate any type of a dilution opportunity?","Nick Akins","Yes, I think you are sort of answering the question and that is we have to understand what, certainly, what the proceeds would be. If there is dilution, then there is all kinds of transactions that could be done to mitigate that. But also from a share buyback and that kind of thing, you could make adjustments there as well. So \u2013 but, it\u2019s too difficult to answer at this point. I mean, there is so many moving parts in that analysis, but we will certainly go through that process.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Excellent. Just one last question, obviously, we have got staff throughout on the PPAs and sort of when you look at sort of what the recommendations are, obviously, what\u2019s the most contentious item. Is it the tenure of the PPA? There was certainly some comments as far as the ROE, is everything sort of up for negotiation?","Nick Akins","Yes. I guess probably the most contentious issue is the PPA itself. The staff said well, we object to a PPA, but it can work under certain provisions. So, if you get to the second door, then it\u2019s probably tenure and those types of things that would be discussed. I mean, just like with a long-term wholesale provider that we provide to you all the time, it\u2019s always priced tenure and what the provisions are, but I would say certainly on the former getting the PPA addressed and then secondly around tenure and then what\u2019s included.","Shahriar Pourreza","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is open.","Andy Levi","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Nick Akins","Yes, I can hear you.","Andy Levi","Great. Just on the PPAs, could you categorize the settlement talks that are going on?","Nick Akins","Well, I have said there were discussions going on. And so we are obviously going through that process and talking about a lot of issues. And really, I can\u2019t say anything more at this time about that, but I can tell you that we are discussing with several parties.","Andy Levi","Great, thank you. And then on the potential asset sales generation, I guess, there are two buckets is kind of the way to look at it that could become one bucket or be broken up into two buckets depending on the PPA? Is it possible that the bucket that is not involved in the PPA gets moved before the PPA gets resolved?","Nick Akins","I would say not likely, because we are looking for an overall answer to this. I mean, obviously, if the PPA is not put in place, then we have a larger amount of generation that we have to go through this process with. So, they will probably be answered at the same time.","Andy Levi","And if you were to get a PPA on the first bucket, would it be possible that you would pursue a PPA for the second bucket?","Nick Akins","Well, that\u2019s an interesting question, but I think getting the PPA through and getting whatever units are included in the PPA, well, I would say that the open units that aren\u2019t included in the PPA, we are not going to assume that they are going to be brought back in at some later time. So besides, we really don\u2019t have the time for that.","Andy Levi","And just regulatory wise, right, the only potential for PPA at this stage is with what\u2019s been filed for, right? You wouldn't be able to add megawatts or assets to that to a settlement process could you?","Nick Akins","Unless, there is a settlement.","Andy Levi","So through a settlement, it\u2019s possible to add megawatts for no better way to put it I guess\u2026","Nick Akins","Well\u2026.","Andy Levi","Is that correct or?","Nick Akins","Yes, but then you wind up with a lot of additional discovery and that kind of stuff around that. So, I am just saying, potentially it could be done, but it would open up perhaps another can of worms that we have to deal with.","Andy Levi","Got it. Okay. Thank you. See you soon.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And that will be from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. I know that, Brian, you mentioned that on \u201816 guidance you have assumed the sale of the River Operation, but you have kept the generation as is. Should we assume that sale at least from a timing perspective is dilutive in \u201816? Is that a fair assumption?","Brian Tierney","The sale of River ops?","Ali Agha","Yes.","Brian Tierney","No. So, Ali, let\u2019s just look at recent earnings history from that business. Last year, we earned $0.10. This year, we are forecast to earn $0.08 for the year. In \u201812 and \u201813, we earned $0.02 per share from that business. So, I would not think of that as being dilutive for 2016.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then also Brian, as you mentioned earlier, your current 4% to 6% growth is based of the midpoint of the original \u201814 guidance. So, as we look forward is that sort of the way to be thinking about it that when you are looking at 4% to 6%, we should use like your original midpoint of your \u201815 guidance as you move things forward or conceptually how should we be thinking about what base to use for that 4% to 6% going forward?","Nick Akins","We will lay out a framework for that at EEI. I need to stop talking about 2014 original guidance, because that\u2019s getting pretty far back in the rearview mirror now, but we will layout that framework at EEI. It\u2019s \u2013 our long-term anticipated growth rate is 4% to 6%. And we can normalize everything and take you through that discussion in more detail at EEI with some charts that were put together.","Ali Agha","I got it. And last question, Nick, as you looked at the timeline on strategic issues on merging the Ohio PPA. Obviously, things have moved as other events have gotten delayed. Are you now at a point where you say, look, we think this will happen by year end and so we will get 30 by early next year, but if regulatory processes continue to get shifted further, is early next year sort of casting stone in your mine to finally resolve the strategic issue on merchant or would you still be flexible depending on how the PPA staff is moving?","Nick Akins","This thing is going on long in that. And I think that we have to get on with making a decision and really our Board has been dealing with this for 1.5, 2 years now as well. So, it\u2019s very important that we get the answers that we need from the commission, so that we understand what Ohio\u2019s policy is going to be in the future. So, my view is that first quarter this coming year, we will have an answer ready with the commission that we know not so much whether it holds up in quarter or anything like that or what the thinking is. And that\u2019s what\u2019s clearly important is the way we address this process and to not be thinking about it for a long period of time or not hearing what people are thinking about it externally from a policy perspective. That is very important to us. So, my view is our patience is sort of run then here and we need to get on with it.","Ali Agha","Just to clarify, so if the PPA ride their discussion for whatever reason is continuing beyond Q1, you are not going to wait for that to continue beyond that, is that fair?","Nick Akins","I think that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s fair. Now, I can\u2019t say that on January 29 or January 30, we think we are going to get an order on February 1 that we are going to pull the plug on January 30. We just \u2013 but we fully expect the commission to get done by year end and then, we will go about the process as quickly as we can to focus on what the future holds. And so I am just saying that first quarter will be, we should be in a position where we move on.","Ali Agha","Understood. Thank you.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information?","Operator","Certainly.

[Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations Betty Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Betty Jo Rosza","Thank you Nick. Good morning everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2015 earnings call for American Electric Power. We're glad that you were able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at AEP.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining us this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas Akins","Thanks Betty Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's second-quarter 2015 earnings call. AEP once again had a strong quarter performance. At the risk of being redundant there are several reasons for this positive performance.","The strength of geographic and state jurisdictional diversity, the passion and culture of AEP employees to continue our journey of efficiency gains through lean optimization activities, positive regulatory outcomes through our focus on operating company performance, continued expansion of our transmission business, increases in all three customer segments; residential, commercial and industrial; and continued positive performance by the unregulated business despite lower than forecasted power prices.","These results continue to illustrate the disciplined execution of our business segments to produce consistent earnings performance for our shareholders. That's what is expected from the next premium regulated utility, our tagline at last year's EEEI financial conference.","The second quarter GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.88 per share, compared with second-quarter 2014 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.80 per share. For year-to-date with the positive performance of the first quarter as well, AEP's earnings stands at GAAP $2.16 per share and operating earnings at $2.15 per share.","As you already know, two days ago the board of AEP authorized dividends to be paid to shareholders of $0.53 per share making this the 421st consecutive quarter of dividends being paid in the history of AEP. It was Plato who said, there is no harm in repeating a good thing.","So in light of that, as we did last year, we are raising our guidance for 2015 from $3.40 to $3.60 per share to $3.50 to $3.65 per share and increasing our capital spend and transmission another $200 million from $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. We are also reaffirming our 4% to 6% earnings-per-share growth rate based upon our original guidance. 2015 is stacking up so far to be another great year for AEP, but we still have 1\/2 a year to go. We aren't popping the champagne corks or anything like that. But we are leaving the second quarter with a smile of quiet confidence as we enter the second half of 2015.","As we have maintained for the last two years, 2016 is a significantly challenged year because of Ohio issues of deregulation and capacity auctions, but we have and continue to chip away at the deficit because of actions taken to continue our expected earnings growth profile. Let me address a few areas before Brian takes over with the details.","While customer load remains somewhat tenuous if you're looking quarter to quarter, during the second quarter all three customer classes, residential, industrial and commercial, increased; particularly commercial load. Continued industrial growth is interesting given it's primarily driven by the oil and gas sector. We usually hear of new rig counts decreasing but that doesn't necessarily translate to load decreases, however.","We continued to see production and load increasing in the shale regions primarily due to continued optimizations of the oil and gas fields including the additions of compressor load. While overall load increases have been slightly less than forecast, the mix between customer classes continues to impact financial outcomes. We will continue to watch the load sectors closely as we gauge the robustness of any potential overall economic recovery.","We continue to be pleased with the progress of our continuous improvement and cultural aid initiatives through Lean and our Power Up and Lead programs that enable a culture and an expectation of continuous efficiency improvements, with decisions made as teams in all levels of the organization.","Regarding Lean activities, we are now complete with 15 plants, with one remaining and have extended into areas such as Cook Nuclear Plant and centralized repair shops as well. We've completed 20 of 31 distribution districts with 10 remaining for this year and one that will extend into the first quarter of 2016. Three of five transmission areas across the AEP have completed Lean reviews, with the remaining anticipated to complete by the end of the year.","Additionally Lean activities are in progress in other areas such as IT, supply chain, inventory management, fleet operations, customer and distribution services and others. This activity has and will continue to be a very important part in engaging our employees to achieve not only our 2016 objectives but also to redesign our business processes and supporting culture for the future.","Starting with the rate case activities, we have completed cases at APCO in West Virginia and in Kentucky. We also initiated rate case at PSO in Oklahoma. The West Virginia rate case outcome met our expectations of improved revenues to support the quality of service to our customers and improvement in the recurrent expectations with investments made at APCO.","The order authorized an increase in rate with an ROE of 9.75% with additional revenues for vegetation management, confirmation of the base rate transfer of the Mitchell plant, resolution of the consolidated tax issue, among other areas that really set a positive tone for the future.","Regarding Kentucky, the rate case outcome there again was constructive for future investments. The $45 million rate increase authorized included 10.25% ROE for several riders regarding certain Mitchell and Big Sandy activities including incremental vegetation management. Also importantly, it allowed the recovery of North Zip compliance costs, signaling the recognition by the commission of the importance of these types of expenditures. It also settled the issues related to the fuel cost recovery case that was before the court.","While with these two cases completed along with the formula base rate adjustments at I&M and SWEPCO we have now secured the forecasted rate changes for 2015. Additionally we filed a base rate case at PSO to recover generation and environmental related costs, as well as other cost adjustments with the request of 10.5% ROE. Rates in that case are intended to be effective in first quarter of 2016, so overall a great story regarding regulatory performance.","As you all know by now, FERC had approved the capacity performance model that PJM had proposed and last night threw a wrench in the plans for at least a supplemental auction being held next week. But regardless, the upcoming base residual auction will ultimately help define the forward view of generation value. The supplemental auction remains important for our risk-adjusted 2016 performance.","We'll be participating in all of these auctions, of course not saying how. But we are hopeful to see improvement in valuations of our generation. These auctions will affect the financial outlook for unregulated generation, in particular baseload generation and will begin to answer some of our 2016 risk-adjusted assumptions. More clarity on the subject will be provided when we get 2016 guidance at the EEI Financial Conference.","The forward view of generation will also be an important data point as it relates to our evaluation process of the unregulated generation. The process continues with these instructive and perhaps substantial data points that we have been discussing with our board for a couple of years now. Chuck Zebula and his team have done an outstanding job compartmentalizing the risk of this business and are positioning the business in a positive way regardless of the outcome.","PJM and FERC have done their jobs in at least making some progress in allowing for a potential path for improved generation value. The only holdout is the Public Utility Commission of Ohio on the PPA question. We would not have presented the PPA option through the Commission if we did not think it was important. It's important for Ohio and its energy policy, Ohio jobs, taxes, economic development and in fact, the future of the generation business in Ohio. Governor Kasich once give me some advice. Don't get so buried in the financial expectations of the company that you lose sight of doing the right thing.","If we take a look back at AEP's proud history of owning and operating generation in Ohio, we have always supported the economic engine for growth whether it be the assets themselves, the ancillary assets such as transmission, the supported economic developed or the development of domestic Ohio fuel to support the generation.","So what's happened in the last few years in Ohio? Well, for AEP over $0.5 billion in write-offs, the incremental loss of capacity revenue or approximately $200 million, each and every year in the last three years and a state that is left short of generation capacity to serve Ohio customers. Not a good story for generation investment in this state because we serve 11 state jurisdictions of almost all regulated jurisdictions as well as significant transmission across the country, we have managed the loss of Ohio revenue pretty well. That's the value of diversity.","But this is really about the customers in the state of Ohio. It's about volatility of electric pricing, particularly in extreme heat or extreme cold that impacts all customers' pocketbooks. It's about Ohio's energy and financial future by developing its own resources such as natural gas and maintaining existing resources. Continual delays are not the answer. It's time for the PECO to do the right thing.","Moving on to another subject, we continue to participate in the EPA dialogue regarding the clean power plan. We've talked at length in previous earnings calls about the challenges the proposed rule produces for the state utilities and other stakeholders so I will not cover that ground again. I will say that I believe through conversations at the White House and the EPA that there is an understanding of the major issues involved, namely the aggressive front-end 2020 emission targets and timeline and the reliability applications. What they ultimately do about it in the final rule we don't know.","We will continue to work with our states to understand the final ruling implications and engage in the succeeding deliberations to achieve an ultimate result that is reasonable and rational and its impact on customers costs and reliability of supply while maintaining to achieve environmental progress.","Let's turn to the next page. The famous equalizer graph, there is a couple of start things in the equalizer graph that I will get into here but from an Ohio power situation, the ROE for AEP Ohio decreased this quarter primarily due to lower earnings driven by increased PJM and property tax costs and lower margins due to seasonal rate adjustments. However we do expect the AEP Ohio subsidiary will finish the year in line with the 12% ROE forecasted.","For APCO you just heard about the rate case in West Virginia and the outcome there. So rates were implemented in June or 2015, so we expect to see higher ROEs for APCO for the balance of the year and that will continue to improve. The primary drivers - and Kentucky is one of those areas 0.6% does not look too good. But the primary drivers for the decrease in ROE were the $36 million regulatory provision that was reported for the fuel cost recovery disallowance related to Mitchell, plus an additional $7 million that was recorded in 2015.","Also Off-System Sales have been off slightly in Kentucky as well, but we expect the ROE will grow to approximately 5% by the end of 2015 and should be in the 9%-10% range by the end of 2016. We should see a measurable progress here in the next year and a half.","I&M continues to do well. It's on track to grow earnings and achieve its authorized ROE range. They are in the middle of several capital investment programs particularly in generation with Rockport SCR, solar installations, nuclear lifecycle management and its well transmission projects, so we continue to see that one improve.","PSO did improve modestly as a result of higher retail margins primarily on increased rider revenues and lower O&M expenses. A base rate case, I mentioned earlier, has - had been filed July 1, 2015, so we expect continued recovery there as well. And SWEPCO, the transmission cost recovery in Texas and a formula-based rate true-up in Louisiana as well as a true-up in increased wholesale customer rates were the primary drivers for SWEPCO's ROE improvement during the second quarter. However the ROE continues to be under pressure because of the Arkansas portion of TERC and we continue to analyze our alternatives and timing associated with addressing the 88 megawatts of TERC that are still outstanding.","AEP Texas we expect the ROE&A there to continue to decline somewhat through 2015 as distribution has raised their CapEx and the need to infuse equity to replace tax obligations due to related deferred taxes from the securitization. The AEP Transmission Hold Co. is doing well. Its Hold Co. returned 11.9% is still in line with its authorized return so it continues to do well.","So from an equalizer standpoint the numbers are reasonable. The overall has come up, it will continue to come up and Kentucky which is the one that is showing extremely low, will make rapid progress so we're in good shape there. The transformation of our industry is occurring. AEP will continue to position itself to succeed.","If I could borrow from Jim Collins, the famous business author, of Good to Great, Great by Choice and other books, what our investors have witnessed over each quarter of the last four years has been the beginning of AEP's version of the 20 mile march. With dogged determination, disciplined execution and AEP ingenuity, we will be successful as the next premium regulated utility. Brian, I will turn it over to you.","Brian Tierney","Thank you Nick and good morning everyone. Let's begin on slide 5 with a review of the major drivers affecting the earnings comparison for the quarter. This year's second quarter operating earnings were $0.88 per share or $429 million compared to $0.80 per share or $390 million last year. This solid performance for the company was driven by our regulated businesses where we are investing for our customers, executing on our regulatory plans and spending O&M wisely.","With that overview let's review the major earnings drivers by segment. Earnings per share for the vertically integrated utilities segment was $0.43, up $0.12 from last year. Key drivers in the quarterly comparison include rate changes which added $0.11 per share and are related to the recovery of incremental investment to serve our customer. This improvement includes the effect of annual true-ups related to FERC formula rate customers.","Warmer temperatures in 2015 and higher normalized margins each added $0.01 per share to the quarter versus last year. The growth in normalized sales is primarily driven by improvements in the commercial class. I'll talk more about load and the economy in a few minutes. The vertically integrated segment also benefited from lower O&M expense, adding $0.02 per share for the quarter. Partially offsetting these favorable items is a $0.03 per share decline in off system sales margin which was driven by much lower power prices this year.","The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.16 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 from last year. The $0.02 per share decline in normalized margins is due in part to the elimination of seasonal rates in Ohio beginning in 2015. This will reverse over the balance of the year.","This segment was also adversely affected by $0.01 per share from higher O&M expense primarily due to higher transmission costs in Ohio. These two unfavorable items were partially mitigated by earnings on incremental. investment and distribution facilities to benefit customers in Ohio. The Transmission Hold Co. segment continues to grow, contributing $0.13 per share for the quarter, an increase of $0.03 per share over last year. Year-over-year the Transco's net plant grew by approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 57%.","The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.16 per share, off $0.04 from the second quarter of last year. As expected we're beginning to see the adverse effect of lower Ohio capacity revenue. You will remember our 2015 forecast included a capacity revenue decline of $0.35 for the year beginning in June. Despite this decline, the segment benefited from favorable hedging activity which helped offset the impact of weaker market prices.","AEP River Operations declined $0.01 per share quarter over quarter, reflecting a decline in barge revenue due to high water conditions in May and June. Corporate and other earnings were unchanged from last year's results.","On slide 6 we have a view of year-to-date operating earnings compared to last year. Operating earnings for the period end at $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion, compared to last year's $1.95 per share or $950 million. Similar to the quarterly comparison growth from our regulated businesses is driving results with the competitive businesses performing close to last year. Weather had no impact on the year-to-date comparison.","Earnings per share for the vertically integrated utilities segment were $1.03 per share this year up $0.15 from last year. The major drivers for the segment include the favorable effect of rate changes for $0.15 and the effect of the Virginia rate legislation adding $0.03 per share.","Remaining drivers were discussed at length during our first-quarter call; as a reminder these include lower normalized margins, primarily due to lower residential sales in the East, the effect of lower power prices this year on both our Off-System Sales margin net of chairing and PJM expenses and lower O&M this year primarily driven by a decline in employee-related expenses.","The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.36 per share for the first six months, down $0.02 from 2014 consistent with the second quarter. We're on track to achieve the segment's earnings target for the year. The Transmission Hold Co. segment earnings through the first half of the year are at $0.21 per share, up $0.06 for the same period in 2014. Similar to the quarter, increased investment is driving the year-to-date results.","The generation and marketing segment matched last results through the first half of the year. As I mentioned we're seeing the adverse effect of lower capacity revenue but our trading and retail activities have offset this impact. And finally AEP River Operations remains favorable for the first six months driven by lower cost in the first quarter.","In summary when you look at our performance for the first half of 2015, you see our regulated utilities executing on their investment and rate recovery plans while demonstrating cost discipline with day-to-day operations. Our competitive businesses, despite being challenged by the decline in capacity revenue, have produced earnings at last year's level as the commercial and retail teams continue to take advantage of the available opportunities.","This combination has allowed us to exceed last year's results by $0.20 per share. Strong results from the first half of the year and a stable outlook for the balance of the year serve as the basis for raising the operating earnings guidance range to $3.50 per share to $3.65 per share.","Now let's look at slide 7 to review the normalized load performance for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, weather normalized load grew by 0.009% compared to last year. With growth spread across all our major retail classes. This brings our year-to-date normalized growth within 0.003% of last year's results through the second quarter. In the upper left quadrant residential sales are up 0.003% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The growth in residential sales is largely coming from customer growth which is also up 0.003%.","Most of the customer growth is happening in our Western territory, especially Texas, where residential counts are up 1.2% versus last year. Year-to-date residential sales are down 2.2% versus last year; this is mostly a result of the weak normalized growth reported the first quarter. Remember that last year's first quarter normalized load was unusually impacted by the polar vortices.","Looking to the upper right corner of the slide, commercial sales were up 1.9% for the quarter. Here we saw growth in commercial sales at every operating company except for Kentucky Power. Once again the strongest growth in the commercial sales is happening in the West, where we also saw the strongest growth in non-farm employment.","Finally in the lower left quadrant, industrial sales growth moderated again from the previous two quarters but still grew by 0.006% compared to last year. We continued to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas related sectors despite the recent decline in oil prices. Outside of the oil and gas sectors, our industrial sales were down 3.2% compared to last year. As many of our export manufacturing customers are starting to feel the impact of the strong dollar and weaker global demand.","With that let's review the most recent economic data for AEP's service territory on slide 8. Starting with GDP you can see that the estimated 1.7% growth for AEP's service area is about 0.5% less than the estimated growth for the U.S. This is not surprising given the impact of falling oil prices, especially in our Western footprint.","As you know, AEP's service territory covers five of the seven major shale areas that the EIA has noted are responsible for 95% of domestic oil production and all of natural gas production growth since 2011. While the entire nation benefits from lower fuel prices, the regional economies supporting these shale plays experience the direct impact of the lost oil and gas jobs in those areas. In fact this quarter marks the first time in over four years where AEP's Western GDP growth fell below that of the East.","In the bottom left quadrant you can see that the job market within AEP's service area to improve in step with U.S. employment recovery. Here job growth within AEP's Western territory exceeds the Eastern service area. The sectors showing the strongest job growth for the quarter included construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest decline this quarter is the natural resources and mining sector which is not surprising given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts.","Now let's turn to slide 9 to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening within AEP's footprint. We continue to see significant industrial load increases in the parts of our service area located in and around major shale formations as illustrated in the upper left chart. It's remarkable that we saw 10% growth in electricity sales to oil and gas related sectors despite oil prices that are down 45% from last year, rig counts being down nearly 60% and 8000 fewer oil and gas workers than we had at the end of 2014.","In the upper right chart Oil and Gas loads spread across all major shale plays within AEP's service territory with the strongest growth located around the Woodford, Eagle Ford and Marcellus Shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components that is upstream, midstream and downstream activities, as shown in the bottom left chart, you see that the strongest growth is coming from the midstream pipeline transportation sector which grew by over 34% in the second quarter. This is mostly due to the expanding infrastructure being built in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales.","In our upstream sector, oil and gas extraction, volumes are up nearly 6% while the downstream petroleum and coal products sector grew by just under 2% this quarter. I should point out that we expect a number of new oil and gas related expansions to come online over the next 18 months.","In contrast to the growth in our oil and gas sectors, I'd like to focus your attention to the red bars on the upper left chart. This shows the trend in our industrial sales excluding the oil and gas related sectors. You can see that the rest of our manufacturing sales are not growing as they were last year at this point. Down 3.2% in the second quarter. In fact through June, 6 of our top 10 industrial sectors are down from last year's results. The only sectors showing growth are the three oil and gas related sectors along with transportation equipment manufacturing which benefits from low oil prices.","The stronger dollar and weak global economy have developed into headwinds for many of our export manufacturing customers. For example, sales to chemical manufacturers were down almost 9% this quarter, while primary metals volumes were down 10%. This is something we will continue to monitor closely as we work through the balance of the year.","On a lighter note, let's turn to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital is very healthy at 54.3%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.6 times and 21.5% respectively.","Our qualified pension funding has improved and is now fully funded at 101%. This improvement was driven by our reduction in liabilities from increased interest rates which more than offset a small decline in pension assets. The company also made a $92.5 million contribution to pension assets in June, as planned which is equal to the company's estimated annual service costs. Since our OPEB funding stands at 122%, no funding will be needed in 2015.","Finally our liquidity stands at $3.2 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. At this point I would like to point out some of the opportunities our Treasury group has taken advantage of during the quarter.","First, at Appalachian Power Company, they redeemed a high coupon issuance and refinanced at a much lower market rate. Secondly the Treasury team extended to April 2017 the $500 million AEP generation resources term loan with a flexible lower-cost facility. And finally, the team partnered with local banks in the Indiana and Michigan service areas to grow that company's local bank facility to $200 million with an expiration in May of 2018.","The company has worked very hard over the last several years to strengthen its balance sheet. As you just heard, our Treasury group is active in the debt markets and working with our banking partners to secure low-cost capital to put to work for our customers. This when combined with our strong operating results give us the confidence to increase our capital spend by $200 million this year.","Let's see if we can wrap this up on slide 11. Clearly the first half of 2015 is off to a strong start for our customers, shareholders and employees. Conditions have been favorable and our operating commercial and corporate groups have made the most of the opportunities available to them. Based on our strong results to date and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're comfortable raising our operating earnings guidance range to between $3.50 per share and $3.65 per share.","Based on our operating cash flows, our strong balance sheet, and our continued access to low-cost capital we're confident in increasing our capital investments this year by $200 million. This incremental spend will be in our transmission businesses, both at the Transmission Hold Co. and at our utility operating companies. And finally, we are reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth range. We have some challenges related to Ohio deregulation and an unsettled economy but we're managing our way through with disciplined O&M spending, the continuous improvement initiatives that Nick mentioned and increased investment in our regulated businesses.","With that I'll turn the call over to the Operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers","Nick, I know you cannot control the government and all regulators but certainly delays in Ohio and the [indiscernible] last night pushed that timeline the clarity on the generation business but can you walk through how you and the board are approaching a decision on monetization. What datapoint you guys think you need to see before you are comfortable formalizing that decision?","Nicholas Akins","Dan, clearly we were looking at the capacity auctions to look at the long-term value generation. The supplemental auctions are by and large sum of the risk-adjusted items and filler in for 2016 and 17 during those years, but in particular 2016.","If those supplemental auctions continue to occur before certainly before in September, October time for an even then we will have a good handle on what we 16 looks like. But the base residual auction is clearly the important one in terms of long-term valuation of generation and we continue to expect those valuations to improve. Our board has been along with us all along the way.","As a matter fact we had a board meeting with them this week. And when over the issues involved and the primary issue was the upcoming auctions that would be a large part of presenting to us our options relative to the strategic valuation of generation. That is the key component. As far as the PPA is concerned that will continue on. It's really hard to tell when the pew co-will focus on that. I would say that we continue to push for the PPA obviously but the main determinant right now with the board is the capacity auction. Once we get that we will have a major data point for the board and we can continue our process of the strategic evaluation.","Daniel Eggers","And on guidance and we're going into the summer but if you look at generation now above your full-year guidance and transmission and the run rate equals your full-year guidance, what are some of the things we should think about tempering the second half results to stay within this elevated band and how particular on some of the segments.","Nicholas Akins","I think you have O&M spent obviously that there is timing issues with O& M. As far as the remaining they could be storm related activities, many things we hedge on. I know that sounds like sandbags to a certain point but it's not that. It's really we're trying to risk adjust some of these issues that can occur. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Yet another big driver is that PJM capacity revenue declined $0.35 almost all that is in the back half of the year. Five cents of that was in second quarter but the remaining $0.30 is back half of the year.","Daniel Eggers","I guess maybe, just the other way how much O&M do you think you can incrementally pull forward from '16 into '15 just to give you a little more breathing room for next year given some of the other built-in challenges there already?","Nicholas Akins","We pulled some already the sequential beyond what we did last year. It's around 14 million. It's getting harder and harder to do that obviously. You can pull some input you cannot pull everything in. I'm seeing that as more limited right now.","Operator","Thank you. Now we will go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to touch on transmission, you're making great progress in terms of incremental spend. I wondered if there were further opportunities that you saw or if you could maybe give us more color on the outlook there to create additional opportunities. What sort of - what are the drivers here as we should think about your ability to grow transmission even further.","Nicholas Akins","There is a lot of color here. We have a lot of incremental spending that we can do in transmission. Right now transmission you think about it we have over 2000 projects going on right now. And those are small projects and larger projects in all that kind of thing. But it shows the bandwidth of what transmission is doing with look at the investment profile for transmission particularly for AEP in it continues to be - it's a huge footprint that we are able to invest in from Transco perspective and from an individual operating company perspective. We mentioned this last time. Just the rehabilitation of the existing grid we are challenged to keep up without that alone put an additional enhancements and we really want to do that because it improves the quality of service ultimately to our customers. And so we have a lot of runway left a lot to transmission. No question about it.","Stephen Byrd","And switching back to clean power plant, after we see the final rule from EPA could you just talk about sort of the process overall. I know you\u2019ve a bunch of things to think through but how should we think about how you might respond over time in terms of what that will mean for your overall spending plan and how the grid will look and make the power plant etcetera. Can you talk at a high level as to how we should view that for you?","Nicholas Akins","Sure. Obviously it depends upon what the final rule looks like. If you look at the categories - if you're having to adjust natural gas dispatch versus call dispatch example that is one thing.","That ultimately impacts the fuel cost to customers. As a result when you do that kind of switching, but in terms of infrastructure, we've made the plan - our initial approach to this is going to be we get the final rule and if the EPA is fully aware of the issues involved from a reliability standpoint but also from a implementation standpoint and if they wind up being respectful to the state of the resource process that they go through and allow time for that to occur and targets are more rational instead of - 11 states have over 75% of the requirement in 2020 and many states there's over 50% of requirement in 2020. That has to change. It's too early and it is too aggressive emission reduction targets.","If they come off of that and have a rational plan to allow technology to continue to improve and we can actually wind up at a better place at the end of the day in 2030 then that would be a good outcome. In that case we could be able to work with the state. They obviously care about what we think in terms of liability standpoint and the infrastructure that we put in place and how quickly we can do it and that kind of thing. But it is a state plans. And the states have to have time to review those plans and then we start taking actions based upon or our individual states want us to go. In my mind it depends upon certainly the president because the president is driving the bus on this thing.","And the EPA obviously is looking at the issues - all the issues involved and if there is moderation associated with the targeted implementation and being respectful of the state process that need to occur and the infrastructure and timing of infrastructure and having reliability provisions that make sense, then we can get about the process of investing from an AP perspective. We're in the middle of a transformation anyway. The industry is in the middle of a transformation. We've already reduced our emissions by 15% since 2005.","And that process continuing with the advent of natural gas shale gas activity in the advent of renewables putting in solar and doing wind farms, but energy efficiency and better technologies are coming into play as well. There are real opportunities for us to invest in the right things for the future and actually balance out our energy portfolio which is a good thing for this company and the country as a matter fact.","Stephen Byrd","And assuming that again the EPA rule does give you a realistic path as you pointed out is that the past that is - you really couldn't achieve, should we be thinking about resource plan that can be filed and overall plans over time that you would submit that would be out how you see the best path forward and what that would involve in terms of spend an asset mix?","Nicholas Akins","Yes that's right. We be working with the states to file the resource plans and then we was start the actions associated with it. This is a little different than the March reroll per customer approval was planned specific endpoint specific the new index we need to do. This it has got tentacles in many aspects of the electric utility business itself. And it will take some dialogue and serious dialogue and contemplation of how to address these types of issues to me state jurisdictional perspective. And will be a part of that process will follow our resource plan and we will go from there, just like we always have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","You're for the couple times to the 2016 risk-adjusted assumptions. Could you just clarify exactly what you mean by that?","Nicholas Akins","When you go into forecasting a year you are looking at what loads doing and obviously load is moving around on us. The customer mix is moving around on us. Capacity auctions were contemplated whether PPA would occur during that period of time and then of course looking at any transmission investment and those kinds of things that we need to evaluate. Those are important pieces but I think probably [indiscernible] thing we can do is come up with a plan and budget that risk-adjusted many of these items and some of them are externally driven.","Significantly externally driven like the capacity auctions and the PPAs approach in Ohio. So as we go forward in the year, we obviously like to get more information that we can make - really make a quality forecast of what 2016 looks like. I think made a lot of progress. Because we know what we've done relative to the continuous improvement enhancements that have occurred that crescendo over time. And we expect that in our benefit in 2016. These external items are more difficult to tell and really what happened last night is another indication of how things can get adjusted at the last minute. So it's difficult to scale but I think in the next two 22 to 3 months we will see a lot of clarity.","Brian Tierney","And even with all those factors that make mentioned, Steve, as with that we 16 we're still into the operating earnings guidance range that we\u2019ve given for that previously of $3.45 to $3.85 per share.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. As part of this trying to judge how much you need to manage cost and move stuff around depending on how these play out? Is that also what currently you're referring to?","Nicholas Akins","Yes absolutely. We've been moving costs from 2016 into 2015 and 2014. And now we're reaching the point of conclusion where we understand those cost components going into the year. It really is about load forecast and ladies external issues that we are doing with. But those will play themselves out in the next couple of months.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And maybe this is a bit of a commentary in the question but just I know you continue to focus very much on the auction outcomes and maybe a lesser extent PPAs in Ohio for the decision on generation. But there are a lot of other things that affect the value of the portfolio commodity prices, stock market, financing conditions, all those kinds of things. How much do you need - how are you weighing kind of answers to some of these questions versus just there can be periods of time where it's hard to get transactions done.","Nicholas Akins","Obviously the answer is rate environment. We continue to deal with and certainly with Janet Yellen is trying to do with interest rates in the future. Might have an impact but as far as the sector itself and our performance within that sector, we feel very good about the past that we're taking and that is to take risks out of our business. And to make sure that we are able to invest in those things that provide quality returns to our shareholders. And. That is what we control.","And we have to be very disciplined at it and there may be external things that occur around the world or nationally that could impact it but typically though even if you look at commodity prices I think where we're at right now is somewhat of a tenuous economy because we see residential commercial and industrial moving back and forth all during the year. It's like you're in a waiting stage. Who knows what will happen but you could have and energy economy take off or you could have an energy economy that stagnates but these based on public policy whether you exporting or we two other things. It would have an impact on the commodities themselves. And I think it's important for us to be knowledgeable about those kinds of issues so that we can manage our business around aggressiveness met shoulders consistent returns. And that's what we're doing.","Steve Fleishman","Last question, the page with the credit metrics particularly the FFO to debt or the EBITDA metrics clearly shows you are way stronger than your targets. Can you give some thought on what's the ultimate goal? I assume your goal is not to stay dramatically above the targets.","Nicholas Akins","It's to be within those targets, Steve. Part of that rationale is why we increased the CapEx for the balance of the year and of course will be looking at what we expect those metrics to be in 2016. And adjusting our apex forecast accordingly.","Brian Tierney","A lot of this is about making sure that the business is on firm and sound financial footing so that we can make continual judgments about where he put our capital. And we have this huge hedge out there called transmission that we are able to essentially do acquisitions all-time. And it's a good place to be but at the same time we improved our currency value we improved our position from a risk tolerance perspective.","And it is an opportunity for us to reposition this company for the future. We just retired 3500 MW of coal-fired generation. So you are starting to see a rebalancing of the portfolio to address what customers truly want in terms of resources we believe a balanced set of resources is important including cold but we've got to get through the process of ensuring that we're advancing from the other technologies and addressing customers concerns relative to quality of service and that's what we're doing.","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc","Paul Ridzon","The 200 million of incremental transmission capital, how is that going to be divided between holdco and the utilities?","Brian Tierney","About $80 million of that will go to the Transco and remainder will go to the integrated utility operating companies.","Paul Ridzon","Could you give more flavor as to what went better than planned to allow you to raise guidance at this point in the year?","Nicholas Akins","I think we covered that during the meat of the call to a large degree. Rate increases and whether were stronger than what we had forecasted. The regulated businesses are doing very well and the competitive businesses are doing about as well as last year. Cash flow is ahead of expectation and you put all of those things together in that gives us the confidence to raise the operating earnings guidance and raise the CapEx that we talked about","Brian Tierney","And the continuous improvement activities, they are starting to culminate across the Board. So it's cost control, it's certainly the underlying fundamentals of the business are very positive and it gives us the confidence to raise the earnings.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of [indiscernible]","Unidentified Analyst","Can you talk about the scale of the open position at AEP generation resources as you look out over the next few years or how to think about that as a sensitivity?","Nicholas Akins","They are trying to stay in a hedged position of about 60% -70%. I think they've done that to pretty good effect really since early last year when the business started. And that allows them to do a couple things. Allows them to hedge in what some of the earnings are going to be at prices that they find attractive and they do that through both retail - they also auction they have to serve FFO vote and their normal trading activity.","But then it also leads them with an open position to take advantage of what could be higher prices like they have during the Polar Vortex sees of last year. Take advantage of that. And to cover things like unit outages or load spikes or price spikes that can happen in the short term. They don't want to be sold out and fully committed. They want to have a significant portion hedged and a portion to cover from on expected short-term opportunities","Brian Tierney","Chuck and his team continually evaluate that but the 60 to 70% has been a target for a very long time now. It's for that reason - we are risk-averse from that standpoint because that business is really focused on making sure it continues to be an airtight business that has like I said earlier, Easton a great job of compartment slicing the risk. And that is a part of that ability for them to do that.","Nicholas Akins","The assets that Chuck has in that business are great assets and the risk management they've applied to that is this has been phenomenal through some really pretty volatile circumstances over the last year and half. We really proud of the way they are managing that business and they've done it very to good effect financially.","Brian Tierney","Really when we look at it's not internally what the issues are because we can control what happens all to have Power Generation operates from operational excellence perspective. And how we manage risk within that envelope. The real issue is what happens outside with the regulatory commissions, FERC, Ohio and elsewhere. But certainly yesterday was another indication. Markets moving toward a certain set of conditions for the auction and it gets changed at the 11th hour and that is a concern because you never know what the rules of the game are and they can change at the last minute or change afterwards. And that is troubling. I think consistency - we have consistency internally. It's consistency externally that we need.","Unidentified Analyst","Is it presents us to say that you are bullish about power prices?","Nicholas Akins","I wouldn't say that's presumptuous. I really believe we have taken substantial amount of capacity that's been retired and we believe that capacity prices will improve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Any update on the River Ops transaction that you talked about last quarter?","Nicholas Akins","The process we're going through terms of valuation continues. That's really all that we can report at this point.","Operator","And we will now go to the line of Paul Fremont with Nexus. Your line is open.","Paul Fremont","I guess I wanted to follow up on the PECO [ph] decision yesterday to get further consideration at some point in the future of your rehearing request in the [indiscernible] proceeding.","Nicholas Akins","It just looks like it is some continued delay really. We don't seem to be getting answers or schedules or the things we need to be able to get the answers we're looking for. They seem to be putting some of the decisions further out into the future and as Nick said we need some clarity and we don't seem to be getting it.","Brian Tierney","I don\u2019t know far you can delay these things. It's an issue where there needs to be an answer and I'm just concerned that we are either waiting until after the capacity auctions or whatever. Ohio needs to be concerned about - yesterday was another indication if you're going to depend upon from the federal side to address the market issues that changes will occur that you didn't - you may not anticipate. And I think from a generation perspective we've got to make sure that Ohio continues to develop and certainly with the natural gas out there that nothing will happen until there is some resolution so you're in a hold pattern. We're not going to make any investments in central station generation in Ohio. I have not seen many others step up to the plate. I know there's maybe one or two units that are being built out there but keep in mind you've retired thousands and thousands of megawatts and you're short in Ohio. And so the delays need to come to an end.","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to the line of Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin","Just a brief one on your earlier balance sheet comments, clearly the metrics are looking a little better debt to cap numbers of strategy around and even the pension funding numbers looked really solid. Given all of that does it make sense on the margin to reconsider capital deployment towards maybe looking at the dividend policy as opposed to truly looking at transmission CapEx? And marginal changes there to think about?","Nicholas Akins","The real question is what happens to the dividend.","Brian Tierney","In so many words, yes.","Nicholas Akins","Yes. Usually we review the dividend policy in the October timeframe and our board certainly will be considering the dividend policy. We still maintain our 60% to 70% range we stated earlier and the dividend will be commensurate with the earnings profile looks like. We stand by that. There's no reason to see it will change but obviously we look at the baseline of the business and with the forward long-term view would looks like and the board will reevaluate and do that in October timeframe.","Operator","Thank you. We will go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony Crowdell","I guess this is a softball question. Do you think Governor Kasich entering into the race slows decisions down in Ohio? It looks like [indiscernible] with the endgame is where they are looking to punch you but do you think this slows things down or speeds things up or has no impact?","Nicholas Akins","My bet would be no impact because Governor. Kasich obviously has confidence in the commission and certainly Andre Porter is chairman has taken over there and my belief is that he is going to leave it to the commission to decide what this Ohio policy looks like. I don't see his running for office of the president to slow things down. I guess the real question is will the PCO actually speed up? That is something that they need to address.","Anthony Crowdell","Do think they are waiting for - Brian had used that football metaphor for they keep punting. Are they punting to a certain calendar date or a certain time whether it's PGM is resolved or is that their target or is not really sure?","Nicholas Akins","Only they can answer that. It's one thing to have one delay but to have delays of several cases occurring, that's really not a good message. And to said energy policy in the state, you've got to have the courage to step up and make a decision.","Brian Tierney","And see them score touchdown or field goal rather than punt again.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","I just wanted to make sure I heard your original commentary correctly, with regards to your thinking on the generation business. So as you said these Ohio PPA [indiscernible] most likely now we\u2019re looking at that maybe in 2016. But if I'm hearing you right should we still expect your final decision on the merchant business this year in the remaining months of this year? Or is that also going to be dependent on when this PPA rider stuff now comes out?","Nicholas Akins","I think certainly the capacity performance and the base residual auctions are significant piece of that discussion. We're going to have to see - what the lay of the land is after that is concluded to visit with our board and determine what the next steps are. But that doesn't stop us from pushing ahead with the PPA proposals regardless of the outcome. But certainly I think Ohio could send a great message by proving those PPAs. It remains to be seen whether we're going to actually wait.","This can't go on for a long time. We're after certainty for our investors and from a shelter perspective, we cannot have this overhang because it really not only confuses us on how to invest in the unregulated generation or lack of investment, but it also is so convoluted that it is difficult to understand exactly what it is you have in terms of valuation of that generation. And so the steps being taken particularly with the clean power plan and other things that are occurring I think those units will survive the clean power plan because there absolutely needed.","They are great units and they are 2\/3.1\/3 gas. A lot of fuel switching occurs between coal and gas. So they are valuable units but they just need to be reflected that way. I just think it's something we've got to get a handle on. As far as timing is concerned, we want to make that decision as quickly as we possibly can. But we have to do what is right for the shareholders and we have to do on analysis based upon what we can determine the best we can with the value of that generation on the forward basis will be. If you get a great capacity performance number, then that may diminish the need for PPA. But I still think PPA is needed. It's an important part of the hedging for customers in Ohio.","It's important part of that generation being maintained in Ohio with the jobs taxes and everything else I've talked about. We're not going to - we have not and will not give up on the PPA approach with the commission. They need to answer that question. It would be great if the answered it relatively quickly so we can get on with the business at hand. But certainly those two items are still outstanding and we're hopeful that at least one of them will get resolved very quickly, so that we can start filling in the blanks.","Ali Agha","And from a logistics point of view, Nick, there would be no constraint for you to exit the merchant business while this PPA rider application was still outstanding ask","Nicholas Akins","We don't believe there is a constraint because the real value of the PPA is again to maintain the generation in Ohio and make sure that economically there is still there and regardless of the outcome of the disposition of that business.","Ali Agha","And last question, is it fair to assume that previously you had looked at scale and spin off as two trajectories. Is still look a little more likely outcome than spin off? Is that fair to say?","Nicholas Akins","We don't know that yet. We've all these events look at things like the tax efficiency and other parameters before we can really make a decision on sale versus spin. Or for that matter keep but certainly sale and spin which you mentioned. Those are areas where we have to look at the economics and it depends on - you've got to be offered a sale price that overcomes the tax efficiency of the spin and there is other things involved with it from a business perspective as well. I would say both are still part of the decision process.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","A quick question if you look at all and get some clarity around transmission spending, [indiscernible] has been The gems been evaluating reduction in the forecast but from what I understand you are investing below the [indiscernible] level as in its basic transmission investments at the lower KV.","How do think about the impact of potential reduction in PJM load forecast relative to your investment plans near term and long term it's actually in the context of having more proceeds from any prospective sale of the River Ops or [indiscernible] etcetera.","Nicholas Akins","I don't anyone knows what the load forecast is at this point and certainly we don't know the level of investment needed from a transmission perspective. We are in the process of redefining this electric grid. And we have retirements that occurred on one of the transmission has been built because of the retirements but also there continues to be optimization across the grid as a result of their will be more optimization after the clean power plan gets resolved. The changes occurring in PJM now are more about generation and certainly reliability and less so about load. And so I wouldn't put much context in terms of a forward-looking transmission plant.","We've seen over and over how transmission plans change with varying degrees and sometimes we get irritated by that because we plan transmission like PATH and things happen. But if you look at the underlying fundamentals of transmission, the grids is changing dramatically. The flows on the grid are going to change dramatically. So when you look at the four power transmission system you can be bullish about that and then the underlying which you mentioned the lower KV levels be some transmission and those levels, there is a massive amounts of rehab work and follow-up work to forward purchasers and at least be done. And we happen to have the largest transmission system in the country so that bodes well for the investment potential for AEP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Perhaps just to clarify if you will, in the increase in transmission spend off late and just thinking about the sensitivity if there were to be a shift in the RTEP [ph], it seems that you guys have historically had some element of comfort around projections given that they don't primarily seem to flow out of the [indiscernible] process, if you could elaborate a little bit. Just getting some sense of how hedged are you presently to changes either way in RTEP.","Nicholas Akins","We have a bunch of big buckets and a lot of those big buckets are not RTO dependent.","Brian Tierney","Our transmission spend and forecast is not dependent on a RTEP load forecast. I would not put a lot of stock in a RTEP load forecast anyway.","Operator","We will go now to the line of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Couple of ones, first one with the transmission auction have you guys heard from PJM or do you guys have any idea when the new schedule might be or when we might get more information on that?","Nicholas Akins","Yes we will know soon. I think certainly PJM will have to speak about the ins and outs of that but we suspect it will be within maybe a month or three weeks delay or something like that. I don't think it's a substantial thing. Still have to observe the same performance criteria when they did in. I think it should be a large delay.","Unidentified Analyst","If it might be before the PRA?","Nicholas Akins","I don't know about that. They will have to answer that obviously but I don't think we're talking about moving into fourth quarter or anything.","Unidentified Analyst","Let's hope not, just another quick one for you. In terms of the potential asset sale or spend which you guys be open to idea of accepting other entities currency like a stock deal? I'm sorry guys would prefer cash if short sell the Junco would you guys be open to the idea of maybe taking the equity of whatever one of the players out there that has been acquiring these things?","Nicholas Akins","Paul, at this point is worth evaluating. I think everything would be on the table. We wouldn't say no to that if we felt that was the highest value for our shareholders.","Brian Tierney","I think we haven't closed off on any of these parameters that we keep talking about because frankly we don't have the full answers yet.","Unidentified Analyst","On the delays that have been happening in Ohio etcetera, have you sensed any change in tone or issues that have come up or any flavor as to the environment there with respect to this? Or is this regulatory stuff that happens in a lot of major proceedings that are not exactly run-of-the-mill?","Nicholas Akins","Obviously the PUCO I speak for supplement issue but it is a major issue. You can't get around that. I'm sure there's a lot of deliberations occurring over in their camp and it's part of the regulatory process. Many times I think it support for policymakers to understand the business disruptions that occur relative to either waiting for decisions or not making decisions let alone the wrong decisions. We really do need some consistency and delivering on orders and rulings on a timely basis. I think it's particularly important to the industry and particularly important to electric utilities in Ohio.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay but you have noticed a significant shift I guess or any change in what's going on there other than normal back-and-forth and what have you? Or have you?","Nicholas Akins","I don't think there's been a significant shift or anything. I think there's a lot of dialogue going on. We have dialogue going on these issues in the Ohio business Roundtable and the close partnership and of course at the commission as well. It is an important issue but I haven't sensed a change. I think it's a very deliberative approach.","Operator","The final question will then come from the line of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","We have touched a lot on PGM and PPA. Fix it over to transmission back again. Could you talk about what you guys are thinking any update on potential alternative structures? I know last time you talked about the restructure doesn't make sense for you guys. Any updated thought process on that? And the second non-related question that could you talk about what you are - I know demand looked pretty good on normalized basis. Angel more insight into with respect to you see pattern to what you're seeing there are what sort of aside from just a general economy improving that striving the growth or demand improvement there?","Nicholas Akins","Brian, covered the economy piece of it. As far as transmission is concerned we have in changed our approach to the transmission business we're still heavily investing in it and we still want to make sure that we continue to do it in a positive way from a state perspective. We haven't changed our approach from that perspective. Brian?","Brian Tierney","I think on the customer usage side a large part of what is driving residential in particular is customer counts. We are seeing average customer usage hang in there. We're not seeing decreased to the degree some others are. But it is customer count that is driving it. I've been this job for five and half years maybe more and I've been talking about 5.3 million customers that whole time. I'm finally through to be able say we're rounding at 5.4 million customers. Customer counts particularly in the West helping us out. It's largely driven by is not the talk about macro factors but a lot of it is shale gas and with the economy are doing well. We are seeing increased usage. In places like Kentucky Power that is being particularly hard-hit by mining shutdowns in the like we're seeing customer counts decrease and used down. It really does unfortunately follow the macroeconomic factors that we are seeing and we are blessed to have the shale gas plays in our service areas and that's really driven a lot of the load increases that we've seen.","Betty Jo Rosza","Thank you everyone for joining us on today's call.

Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kaylee. Good morning everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2016 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining AEP's first quarter earnings call. Financially, 2016 is off to a steady start that delivered earnings consistent with our plan for the year, so all is in good shape there. It was not without challenges though, we overcame the winter that never happened, and of course, the anticipated changes from 2015 such as loss of capacity revenues related to the Ohio transition order that ended in May 2015, and the loss of AEP River Operations revenue due to the sale that occurred late last year.","Positive rate changes, continued benefits of managing expenses and disciplined market hedging activities enabled GAAP and operating earnings to come in at $1.02 per share. This compares with $1.29 and $1.28 per share of GAAP and operating earnings respectively for 2015. The impact of weather was significant for the quarter. Brian will cover this in detail a little bit later, but we had the sixth warmest winter in the last 30 years in 2016. And remember, we're comparing against the second coldest winter in 2015.","So considering this difference, I would say we had a great quarter from an earnings perspective that showed the resiliency of our plan for the year and the strength of our foundation for continued growth. We are reaffirming our guidance range of $3.60 per share to $3.80 per share and our 4% to 6% growth rate to further signal our confidence in how the year is likely to shape up for AEP.","I'm sure many of you have questions concerning last night's FERC order. So let me put some perspective on that. Obviously, we are disappointed with the FERC decision to review our PPA arrangement under the EDGAR rules based upon the presence of non-bypassable charges, but that being said, we embarked on the best mechanism within the existing Ohio legislation that we felt could withstand legal scrutiny that would allow the Ohio Commission to have a say regarding the long-term viability of resources and the development of new resources within the state.","And the positive note regarding Ohio activities during the first quarter is that the PUCO did the right thing. They approved the PPA and not only sent a message regarding investment resources located within the state, but also focused on moving toward a balanced set of resources that included renewable development that would have advanced any potential clean power plant objectives. But FERC has spoken. And unless we have the patience for what could be a lengthy review process by FERC, this option could be off the table.","So here is what I want to be absolutely clear about. AEP is moving toward being a premium regulated utility, one that is advancing toward being the next generation energy provider that has a vibrant energy grid with not only a balanced set of generation resources but the technology deployment of tomorrow to enable a clean reliable and affordable energy product to our customers. We have no interest in getting involved in a protracted FERC state jurisdictional dispute. So we will move as expeditiously on Plan B as possible to resolve any uncertainty regarding our being the next premium regulated utility.","So this is a two-prong approach that will be pursued in parallel. So we can still meet our objectives as quickly as possible. Number one, we already have a strategic review that I will update you later regarding the non-PPA assets. We will begin a strategic process for the PPA assets as well.","Number two, we'll push for re-regulation in the Ohio legislature to repeal and replace SB 221 or enable the transfer of and cost recovery for certain resources in AEP Ohio, thereby eliminating the need for a PPA. This will secure Ohio's role in determining its own resource mix with a structure that enables long-term and short-term deployment of generation related resources in the state. These two prongs will progress in parallel, and whichever results in AEP becoming fully regulated earliest will be completed.","All of these state related issues are occurring out of frustration with organized markets such as PJM that have an inherent inability to allow states to make decisions regarding their own resources. Ohio needs to decide expeditiously, does it want to control its own development of resources within the state, or leave it to PJM in the federal government who have conflicting multi-state interest.","Regarding the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, we believe that these two remanded cases should be taken up together at the PUCO because they clearly are interrelated. The first order concerning the capacity charge and the energy credit set by the PUCO, the court said clearly that the AEP should recover our generation capacity cost and that the PUCO erred in its use of the energy credit instead of listen to AEP's concerns.","The second order concerning the rate stabilization recovery mechanism said that it was permissible to have deferred capacity cost recovered in the RSR, but not the component of the RSR that reflected transition or financial integrity revenue. All of these together say that the remand to the PUCO requires the recovery of all of AEP's capacity cost. Therefore, once the debt settles on which buckets costs are attributed to, AEP expects the result to be neutral or positive to earnings.","The last topic to review is an update of our strategic process, so that you will know where we are at. We have opened a confidential data room. There is considerable interest by several parties and the process is moving according to schedule with final bids in the third quarter and aggressively completing a transaction by the end of the year.","Now, at this point I'll move to the equalizer chart on the next page to talk about some of the state regulatory activities. So overall, we're seeing a 9.4% in return. As you recall from the last quarter, it was 9.6%, but we expected it to come down during the first half of the year and then move back up towards that approximately 10% that we had discussed earlier. So everything is still on plan for that.","Looking to the Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with our expectations and we expect to finish this year in line with the 11.9% ROE forecasted. For APCo, the decrease in ROE from December to March is primarily due to unfavorable weather this winter, 2015 reversal of previous regulatory provisions as well as the performance of the merchant portion of the Mitchell Plant. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016. So we'll see that start to kick-in. And as they phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend at or near the 2016 forecasted ROE. For Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized a $45 million rate increase that was effective in July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE during 2016 as the year goes on.","For I&M, it achieved an ROE of 10.2%. I&M continues to benefit from good regulatory frameworks in place for the major capital investment programs it has going at our Rockport, SCR, solar, the nuclear lifecycle management at Cook and Transmission PJM related projects. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016. PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. In December, as you would recall, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million that's subject to refund on January 15, so that's kicked in and we should expect that ROE to continue to improve.","SWEPCO, we expect to see some improvement in ROEs from some recent filings, but they continue to be challenged by some of the wholesale revenue that's rolling off there, but also the positive indications are that they're filing an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover our retrofit investments in Welsh and Flint Creek Power Plants and then in Texas, we filed Transmission & Distribution riders there as well.","In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric loads and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. So on April 6, TCC and TNC filed distribution cost recovery factor filings seeking recovery of distribution investment from July 2006 through December 2015 with rates expected to go into effect September 1. AEP Transmission Holdco, the transmission side of things, its return is 10.9%, which is in line with expectation. 2016 forecast is 10.2% because of the heavy investments being made there as well.","So all in all, it's been a great quarter. I think that the fundamentals are showing through the company, and certainly we have several opportunities and we'll continue to work on those, but it has been eventful, but our employees' discipline and execution toward a common strategic objective is becoming more evident every day. No doubt our progress will continue toward being that next premium regulated utility. And we can't help but saying, because I just got back from the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, I'll end with a quote from a famous Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame inductee and it says, you will always tell when the groove is working or not. That was from 2004 inductee Prince. At American Electric Power, I can tell you the groove is working.","So Brian, pick it up.","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on load and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position.","Turning to slide five, operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $501 million, compared to $625 million or $1.28 per share in 2015. At the highest level, the decline in earnings this year was driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the expected decline in earnings in the Generation and Marketing segment due to the reduction in Ohio capacity revenues. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, growth in normalized margins and our regulated businesses, and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment.","With that as an overview, let's look at the drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.57 per share, down $0.04, with the single largest driver being winter weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.11 per share.","As Nick said earlier, 2016 was the sixth-warmest winter, and 2015 was the second coldest winter for AEP in the last 30 years. Other major drivers for this segment include the reversal of a 2015 regulatory provision in APCo produced a drag on earnings of $0.03 per share. Off-system sales declined by $0.02 per share due to substantially lower power prices. Higher O&M expense unfavorably affected this segment by $0.04 per share, primarily driven by higher employee-related costs.","Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were rate changes, which were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.06 per share to the quarter, and higher margins on retail sales, mostly related to the timing of mix of sales, which added $0.04 per share. We will look in detail at load and the economy in the next three slides.","Finally, this quarter was bolstered by $0.04 per share from a lower effective income tax rate due to prior-year tax adjustments and tax versus book timing differences accounted for on a flow-through basis.","The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.22 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. This segment's major drivers include rate changes, higher transmission revenues in the Texas companies, and lower O&M expense, each of which added $0.01 per share for the segment. The O&M reduction was due in large part to a contribution to the Ohio Growth Fund made in 2015 that was not repeated this year. Partially offsetting these favorable items is a decline of $0.01 per share related to milder weather in Texas compared to last year.","Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.02. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $910 million, an increase of 39% since last March.","The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share down $0.24 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.12 per share due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio's standard service offer to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.07 per share due to power prices liquidating 32% lower than last year. While the trading and marketing organization performed well, it was not able to replicate last year's exceptional results and was off $0.03 per share.","Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year, primarily the result of having no earnings from AEP River Operations due to its sale in late 2015. Despite mild weather, softness in residential sales and power prices, our performance for the quarter was solid. We have been planning for a couple of years to be ready for the capacity revenue challenges in 2016, and our actions and planning leave us well-positioned to achieve our earnings targets for the year.","Now let's take a look at slide six to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales were essentially flat for the quarter. However, the other charts on this slide show that the growth in commercial and industrial sales has been offset by the decline in residential sales.","Normalized residential sales were down 1.6% for the quarter, although we experienced modest growth in our residential customer counts compared to last year. Most of the customer count growth was concentrated in Texas, where favorable demographics support new household formation. This was partially offset by fewer customers in our eastern territory, specifically around the Appalachian Coal Basin. On the positive side, commercial sales grew by 0.7%. This growth was spread across most of our operating companies, which is consistent with the growth in the service sector employment that we experienced across AEP's service territory.","Finally, industrial sales grew by 0.9% this quarter. The majority of this growth came from the oil and gas sectors, which I will discuss in more detail later. The growth in these sectors helped offset the drag from the primary metals and mining sectors. The weak global demand, oversupply of Asian steel and strong dollar combined to create challenging markets for export manufacturers within our footprint.","Now let's turn to slide seven to look at the most recent economic data for AEP's service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, you see that the estimated 1.8% growth for AEP's service area is now only 0.3% behind the U.S. For the first time since 2014, our eastern territory is now growing faster than the U.S. This was not the case for our western territory where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices.","While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing the negative impact of lost jobs. The charts at the bottom show the employment growth within AEP's service area is holding steady, but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is no surprise that job growth in AEP's eastern territory exceeds the western service area by 0.5% given what we just discussed. The sector is showing the strongest job growth for the quarter, include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 16,000 fewer natural resources and mining employees working in our service territory than last year. Approximately 12,000 of those jobs were located in our western footprint.","Now let's turn to slide eight to review our industrial sales trends by region. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we continue to see the strongest growth in our industrial sales to the oil and gas sectors. The chart in the upper left shows our industrial sales in shale counties were up over 9% versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that oil prices, rig counts and employment in the oil and gas extraction segment were down significantly from last year.","The bottom left chart shows that growth in oil and gas sectors was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus regions. The map on the right now includes our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we are seeing some significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down over 17% this quarter. Low natural gas prices and environmental regulations combined with the drop in metals production and corresponding demand for metallurgical coal have created a perfect storm for Appalachian coal producers. You are likely familiar with the number of bankruptcies and mine closures that have been announced over the past year, citing these exact reasons.","Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were up nearly 1% for the quarter. Some examples of industries that are still seeing modest growth this year include transportation manufacturing and plastics and rubber manufacturing, both of which are tied to auto sales where production benefited from lower fuel prices.","Now let's turn to slide nine to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital rose by 0.5% this quarter and remains healthy at 53.7%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.45 times and 20% respectively. Our qualified pension funding decreased 3% this quarter to 94%, although plant assets increased by 1.2%, plant liabilities increased by 4.5% due to the discount rate coming in lower than the assumed rate of 4.3%. We plan on funding our pension with about $93 million in the second quarter equal to the estimated service cost for the year.","Our OPEB funding now stands at 104%. Plant assets decreased by 1% and plant liabilities increased 4% for the same reasons as the pension plan. The estimated O&M to service both plants this year is expected to be about $20 million.","Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $3.2 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the second quarter of this year, we plan to refinance these facilities with an anticipated tenure expected to extend in the June of 2021. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions.","And finally, so we can quickly get to your questions, let's turn to slide 10. I want to reiterate that the first quarter's results were in line with our expectations. In spite of last night's late breaking news, we remain on track to earn within our previously announced operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2016. As Nick said earlier, our previously announced strategic review of our competitive generation business will continue according to schedule and we will share the results of that process as soon as we can. We expect that to be in the third quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh good morning, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Or good afternoon, whatever it is to you at this point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I think it's good morning, but thank you for such crisp comments on short notice. One question I had is that you talked about the plan with the PPA assets to engage in a parallel path strategic review or re-regulation. Is it possible that that strategic review could somehow be folded into the ongoing process around the non-PPA assets, or do you see these as definitely sort of separate track?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're going to start the process obviously with the PPA assets. We don't want to slow down the other assets. So we're still looking at that to see what can be done to address it, but we don't want to slow down the existing process that's going on. We're going to stay on schedule and we're going to continue cranking away and then we'll initiate the process and actually initiating a process on the PPA assets is relatively easy to do because we've already done it for the non-PPA assets. So it can move along relatively quickly as well. The question is you know I mean to all of a sudden roll it in to the existing process, it may be challenging. We'll just have to take a look at that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just to clarify on timing, I think Nick in your remarks you said you'd hope to have a sort of process fully wrapped up for the non-PPA assets by the end of the year. And I think maybe I heard Brian say, you'd update us on the third quarter. So is there a possibility that year-end is the outside date and things happen quicker?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, obviously, we would want an announcement in the third quarter. And then we'd want to close as quickly as we can and we've been able to close transactions relatively quickly before and it's a known set of assets. So we feel like it may be aggressive, but we want to close by the end of the year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you share when bids are due or anything like that?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have initial bids in a cycle that, I think, occurs during the second quarter and then the third quarter will be final bids.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then can I just (24:38) sort of the other part of the parallel path? Where are you on this re-regulation proposal?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is it kind of standing start or is there some momentum kind of in the background? We've obviously just have the Chairman of the PUC step off the desk or about to.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And can you just kind of update us on how you see that and how likely it is that something could really materialize faster than a strategic review?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I just probably make a distinction because even before we started the PPA, I said the State of Ohio needs to decide, but I'd also said that the Commission needs to decide and because we were trying to do something within the purview of the existing legislation and it being left out to the difference of the Commission to decide. In this case, we're not talking about the Commission. Now obviously we'd love for the Commission to be part of that process. They need to be part of the process but this is a legislative issue. And our concern is, and I think there has to be a broader concern about the state of Ohio and that's represented by the legislature, what do we do to enable Ohio to take a firm hold of the capacity and energy situation within the state, the development of new resources, the jobs, taxes and all those things that we talked about earlier.","And it's not like you're starting at ground zero to do this. I think the issues in Ohio are well-known from an energy policy perspective. Matter of fact, we just got through the review, through the Ohio business round table, the Columbus partnership's been involved. There is definitely already steps being taken. It's a question of, okay, what steps? And there you're talking about, okay, is there a stopgap measure to basically allow the transfer of certain assets within the state of Ohio to AEP Ohio directly and avoid any kind of affiliate transaction, which probably, I would say is probably a better chance of accomplishing something like that and a full re-regulation, but I wouldn't take that off the table either. I mean because I think there's broader issues that are involved here like, for instance, if Ohio wants to move forward with renewables and renewable implementation and balance out the portfolio and focus on natural gas, those are clearly areas that can fall within some form of re-regulation.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Would a transfer like you suggest require FERC approval?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, but that kind of approval, they've already done before. We already did it for net book transfers from our Ohio, what was our Ohio fleet to other jurisdictions, and they were approved without a hitch. So I think there is probably plenty of precedence on that one.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Thank you, Nick. That's all and I also want to thanks for your time this morning.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. How are you doing?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. Fine.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","In the case of let's say total re-regulation, is the Ohio fleet enough to serve returning load, let's say? I mean I'm thinking about the over, I think, a much larger implication that that might entail for the utility, or do you have to build additional generation under that kind of a scenario?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So the first answer is, no there's not enough. Secondly, we'd have to deal with the capacity deficiency either through the market or building new capacity. And I think it's a perfect opportunity for the state of Ohio to look at natural gas and renewables to fill out that approach. And as long as Ohio has control in doing that kind of thing, then we're ready willing and able to move that direction.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Have you already been in touch with members of the legislature to begin the process at this point, or basically this is initial reaction off last night's news?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to address that. I think certainly people are aware of the issues with energy policy in Ohio, and there have been discussions relative to the PPA with legislators, and they're fully aware of what the issues are, and it's not a huge stretch for them to ask the question, well, why don't you just re-regulate?","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","And would it be more accurate to say, this is more like a three-track process where you would go \u2013 re-regulation is track one, and track two might be transferring plants into rate base, and I guess instead of a \u2013 and third is to sell the plants, right, through another process, right?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we have to look at, and probably do have to have discussions about what is the most expedient process, because I mean there's several options here that we can talk about and some of them maybe stopgaps, some of them maybe longer term. And certainly I think that others in the state will agree that we need to respond quickly to enable us to continue to do what Ohio wants us to do with that generation.","And so I'd say we're obviously discussing several options internally among ourselves, but we haven't gone out with specific policy objectives, at least detailed objectives, on how we want to approach it because obviously we want to do what's the most expeditious way to do it. Because in my book, the race is on. The race is on between our option of the strategic evaluation versus our option to have some form of re-regulation coverage. And it maybe a misnomer to call it re-regulation, but we'll have to see what that means. I think AEP has reached the point where it's time to get this resolved once and for all.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. So just to understand this. If you were to be able to transfer stuff into rate base, that would require legislation, is that not correct?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We'd need approval from a legislative standpoint to transfer back into AEP Ohio.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. How long do you think that might take legislatively? I mean how should we think about that as analysts? How quickly do you think that they might be practically able to address something like this?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's probably what we're going to find out, but as far as your timeline, you really ought to be going by our other option of the strategic evaluation. And if we do something earlier, that's great.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I got you. So you're not going to wait for \u2013 you want resolution one way or the other pretty quickly, it sounds like?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're not waiting.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And here's just an idea that \u2013 and if this is crazy, let me know, but what about the idea of \u2013 since this is an affiliate issue at least the FERC order that came out, just simply AEP is assigning the PPA to FE and FE is assigning the PPA to AEP. I've realized that there'd have to probably be some changes, but since PUCO doesn't seem to have that big an issue with it, I mean I'm just wondering is that something that could realistically address the issue, or you follow what I'm saying?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I follow what you're saying. I think probably FERC would follow what you're saying too. So I think that would probably wind up being an issue because you know FERC, they hinged their order. I mean it wasn't just an order saying, come in, let's take a look at it. It was basically saying we don't like the non-bypassables and...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","In the context of an affiliate transaction now. I mean this wouldn't be an affiliate transaction then. I mean I realize it's sort of legalistic, but I mean you guys want to be affiliates at that point?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We will certainly look at that option but...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I just thought...","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I just don't want to introduce any novel issues that would drive our schedule to be even longer, and I think anything to do relative to FERC at this point most likely would be a longer schedule. So we'll have to look at it and see. I mean obviously we'll hold those kinds of options open, but I'm just trying to say our primary options are number one and number two that I had talked about earlier.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","And we'll go next to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Is it reasonable then, and maybe you don't want to answer this, whether the re-regulation scenario or some type of cost of service return on these assets is like a two-year event, or no clarity on that at all?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. It's not a two-year event. I don't think it's a two-year event. I mean, these issues are well-known, and really, I mean what we asked for Senate Bill 221 if you scrap that and kept \u2013 and it goes back to the previous legislation, then there's opportunities there, or it could be specific issues that are dealt with within a smaller legislation that's sort of a stopgap measure to allow the transfer. And so I think that's a relatively simple thing to think about.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","All right, great. And just a quick follow-up. Are there any other instances at all that AEP uses an affiliate waiver that may also be contested?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think we have anything else there.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Oh, great. Thank you so much for my taking question.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to next to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Good morning. Nick, just to clarify your overall thinking on your merchant exposure. I think you said for the non-PPA assets announce something Q3, get it all done by year-end. Is the plan for the PPA assets, whatever it happens to be done by year-end as well, or could this spill into 2017?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think realistically the PPA assets could likely fall into 2017, but I wouldn't think far into 2017 because obviously we have to get a confidential data room with all the analysis and all of the things around those units done, but the parties that are interested in capacity and PJM, they're pretty well-known now. So I think there's probably things you can do to shorten the schedule, but I think to get the non-PPA assets done by year-end is an aggressive posture, but doable but I think probably the PPA assets could fall into first quarter, second quarter next year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Also you said in the past, the PPA assets are the most competitively flattened higher cost coal assets. I mean is one scenario to just throw in the towel and say, you know what, the market isn't giving us the right signal, we don't have any other avenues, we may just shut down this capacity?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we need more data before we can make that kind of decision. So I think you've got to test the market and who knows, I mean, you could have a strong summer and the whole world changes. So I wouldn't have any conjecture on that at this point.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And just on the timing perspective, can you just remind us, when does the legislature meet? I mean, what's their schedule. So if it doesn't happen in this current one, when is the next time they meet, just if that is the option that we're going to be also focused on?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, they can meet anytime.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. They're in session now, but obviously with the presidential election and all that kind of stuff could slow things down, but that doesn't stop you from doing all the education and everything until after the presidential activities are over.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. And fair to say that the FERC coming in that's not done, you're not getting involved in Ohio versus FERC that kind of thing?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. I missed that question.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","With the FERC jumping in and stopping the waiver, I think, did I hear your comments right that you don't see any avenue there that that's just going to be take too long and that's not a realistic path for that whole process to play itself out?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's fallen back to the third option and really we'll have to take a closer look from a legal perspective, can the FERC process be short changed at all and any provisions that could occur there, but I think FERC is pretty well spoken. We could perhaps ultimately prevail, but it's a long circuitous route to get there unless we can find a way to get a more, a clear and concise and quick response from FERC. So I think that's probably a longer hurdle at this point.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Last question. Nick, when you look at your company, the premier utility company assuming these merchant assets are ultimately gone. Does 4% to 6% still look like the realistic growth target or could you look at a perhaps even higher target given the growth that your Transmission business is showing for the next several years?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So I think we'll probably give you some more insight on that in November at EEI, but it's clear that we are reaffirming the 4% to 6% for now, and then and you see the utility growth that's occurring. I mean we show those numbers too. So once we're fully regulated, we'll give a view of what that looks like going forward as well.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Is there any potential if you get expeditious re-regulation that there might be better value in putting some of non-PPA assets into rate base? Are those \u2013 ?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't know really. We don't know the answer to that at this point, because the assets that were in the non-PPA side of things, they were natural gas assets primarily, and the market has certainly valued those assets. So we'll have to look at the numbers and responses. We'll know that pretty soon. And then we'll be able to tell you. But at this point, I think it's just conjecture to assume that but we'll be looking at all the options, don't worry about that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And who is the data room, is it private equity, is it strategics?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's plenty of parties that are in the data room. I just wouldn't want to go any further than that at this point. They'll become known pretty soon.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. If we can move out of Ohio and go a little further south. Louisiana is going to talk today about their tax items. Any insight would you expect to come out of that?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So from a Louisiana perspective, I think, it's really taking a step out there to start to deal with the phantom tax issue. Texas has dealt with it before and that obviously was taken care of. West Virginia the same thing. So, unless Louisiana wants to be unique from every other jurisdictions, but that if they do choose to do something like that, then they're going a very different route. And obviously there's no ex parte communications in Louisiana. So we'll obviously be having discussions about all that with our commissioners.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You have not had a discussion...","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, anything you want to add?","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the update.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","We'll go next to line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. My questions have been asked and answered.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Gregg. Thanks.","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gregg.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, good morning, anyway.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yep. Good morning.","Operator","We'll go next to line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Want to focus on the core business actually and looking at slide four, are you seeing degradation? If I were to look at the same slide for the last year or so, are you seeing some degradation, I mean I'll use a handful of examples. PSO, AEP Texas, SWEPCO, pretty big subsidiaries, numbers appear potentially heading the wrong direction or have headed the wrong direction there. Can you give a little more detail about the dollar rate increase request at SWEPCO and AEP Texas? When you expect those to go in and what kind of impact you expect that to have on regulated returns in both markets?","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Let me start with Texas first. TCC and TNC, we've recently filed the distribution and cost recovery factors there. And those requests are TCC about $54 million, TNC about $16 million in terms of when we expect them to come in place, to propose effective date for both of those is September 1st of this year. And so the effect of those increases will come in, in this chart over the course of the following 12 months in that regard.","In SWEPCO, we also have a Texas TCRF that's in and we've requested an increase of about $4.9 million, a very small average customer increase. In addition, we've had a SWEPCO distribution cost recovery factor, where we've requested another about $9.2 million. So very much trying to take advantage of the relatively quick recovery mechanisms that they have with the cost recovery filings that are short of a full rate case in the Texas and trying to get those increases reflected as quickly as possible to help get some of those Texas and SWEPCO ROEs moving in the right direction.","In PSO, we've implemented a rate increase, effective January 1 of this year, subject to refund and are expecting an order out of the Oklahoma Commission sometime this quarter. And again that should have that PSO ROE moving in the right direction, up closer to the upper 9%s, closer to 10% range.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And keep in mind, Michael, some of this is deliberate too. I mean, like transmission for example, I mean we're spending a lot of money there and obviously it is a great recovery mechanism, but we're still chasing the recovery mechanism because we're investing so much. And in the other jurisdictions, you know we are following rate cases to catch up in certain areas. But all-in-all I mean we look at it like; we're managing these across the board. So some may be you're seeing drop a little bit but there may be specific reasons for that that we're investing in or that we expect rate making aspects to come around at some point, but we're making very deliberate choices. And even during the first quarter, I mean we didn't cut back on our planned O&M or any of those activities because it's the first quarter.","Generally you'd have to say that, yeah probably if you looked at it two years ago, you know we were probably at 10.3% that we estimated for the year but you're still in that 10% area. And that's where we try to manage this thing to ensure that we're meeting that threshold across the board. So you know I wouldn't be looking at SWEPCO, for example, I'm saying. Well that's the general trend for everyone. We've talked about the specific issue at SWEPCO and it's that Turk piece, the 88 megawatts of Arkansas that we really need to resolve, but timing is going to be an issue there.","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know the equalizer chart that you referred to on slide four Michael is very much a heads-up display for us. And when we see those lower ROEs, we are either taking action or have taken action to try and get those improved. And you see that across the board whenever you see those bubbles or balls there whatever you want call them, getting in the lower end of the range.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And I want to follow-up and I know it's a small subsidiary for you, but if I look at Kentucky earning 5.5%, you've got nine months of the rate increase already in effect right now. So you've only got one more quarter of the rate hike coming in. Just curious, what do you do structurally or process-wise to get that closer to a normal earned to return level?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So in Kentucky, we're likely to be making another filing. So when that occurs you'll continue to see that improvement as well. So I sort of look at Kentucky like the little engine that could, because we get some progressive things out of Kentucky like the cyber rider that we had, and obviously it was our first jurisdiction we were able to do a transfer to. So, there are some benefits of being in the Kentucky jurisdiction, but you have to look at this thing in the overall context, it is a small bubble but it's one that's on the uptick from an ROE perspective and we'll continue progressing that way.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Last question. What is the, at the regulated subs, especially T&D and the Vertically Integrated Utilities. What's in guidance for O&M growth year-over-year?","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's either flat to down, Michael. It's that trend that we've had going back to 2011 to have it be between that 2.6% and 2.8% range and we're right about in the middle of that throughout 2016.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","About 2.9% yeah.","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","2.75% really. And Michael that's non-bypassable non-offset O&M, okay.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yep. No. Understood. Just trying to check in on that, because O&M can have a big impact on earned returns as well.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciate it.","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my call. And sorry to go back to the PPA aspects, but looking on the non-PPA, I'm a little confused with the timing and the sequencing. Because if your goal is to get an exit quickly on the non-PPA asset, but you also want to attempt to try to re-regulate, I just don't see how the timing works because if you want to just sell the assets you've probably got to execute pretty quickly rather than wait to try and re-regulate. Could you help me just understand how the timing could work there?","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So there's two different things here. I mean, the non-PPA assets are part of the process that's already ongoing. And that process is already in play. There's already confidential data rooms. There's already a review going on. There's all kinds of things going on with that transaction, and really the schedule is pretty aggressive, but we're going to get it done. The -","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sorry I meant the PPA assets. I was trying to -","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So the PPA assets, obviously we're going to have to do the same thing there in terms of getting a lot of data associated with that. Now just think about \u2013 the original non-PPA assets are plants that are wholly owned, there's no partners, there's primarily natural gas, which is pretty easy to evaluate with Gavin obviously, and Gavin is the piece that people have to take a look at as well. With the other set of assets, I'm sure, we've got to get a lot of data and information together for them to present them in a positive way to ensure that potential investors can look at those assets and give them time to do that.","So we wouldn't want to slow down the existing non-PPA for that. And you can only move so quickly with those kinds of transactions, particularly as it relates to the existing PPA assets, but we'll start the process. We'll move as quickly as we can, but I'm just trying to be realistic in that it will take a little bit longer than the existing schedule we have for the non-PPA. And now what it also says is, is that the re-regulation or anything, any potential option thereof is going to have to move very aggressively. And so we don't have any time to spare on that, because I think that \u2013 but I'm just saying that that's not the critical path. On the critical path, we have two projects: one, the existing non-PPA, and then now we have the existing PPA assets, and we're going to move as quickly as we can. There's been a lot of homework done on it, lot of analysis done on it. So we don't have to do any of that and recreate it, but we've got to make sure our process is robust enough so that people can understand probably a more complex set of resources.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Got you. That's very helpful.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just secondly for both the assets, PPA and non-PPA, could you just remind us, given there's a little bit of timing difference, but broadly both are going to be sold. If that's the base case, could you just remind us in terms of the tax basis or the tax leakage expectation, if any, and the use of proceeds, if it's just going to be for reinvesting in the Transmission side or you're also going to do some share buybacks?","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we've not shared the tax basis on those assets. And really the use of proceeds discussion would be likely timed to when we would announce what a transaction would be, but we have a great opportunity to reinvest in our organic business with those proceeds, as you saw us do, when we had a \u2013 bonus tax depreciation got extended, we're able to increase the CapEx for 2017 and 2018 by $1 billion immediately, most of that going into the wire side of the business, but more a fulsome discussion on what we would do with use of proceeds would likely be at an Analyst Day following the announcement of the resolution of that strategic review.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","What I can tell you is we're very mindful of is that we have a whole laundry list of potential places to put any available cash that comes in. You named one of them, obviously transmission, which we have substantial ability there. There's other things on the list that we continue to invest in, not only the operating companies but also on the competitive side with purchase power arrangements. So those are opportunities that we can continue to develop in anticipation of cash proceeds coming in. But what I want to make sure of is that, we're not going to just get a pile of cash and have it burn a hole in our pocket and we wind up doing something stupid.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Most of my questions were answered, but just on the legislative route. I know it's not probably the primary route you want to take, but this is probably the first instance that I can remember that all the utilities seem like they're unified within the state. So when you're sort of thinking about taking the legislative route, is this something you're going to collaborate with, with your neighboring utilities, and has this sort of been a preliminary discussion?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think our interests are consistently aligned because there's a problem, and everyone knows there's a problem. And for some probably, it's more of a problem than others, but it's still a problem. So we're going to continue to address it, and you'll have to ask Chuck at FE and others, what their thoughts are, but I would venture to say that our interests are aligned in many ways from that perspective because there is a problem.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, good. And then just lastly, not to drill another parallel path here, but is there an option to hold a competitive RFP process for the PPAs and allow the other gencos to bid into this?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess the question is, is there enough capacity? I'd just have to take a look at that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, good. And then just lastly here bypassable...","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just say this, though...","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","... I really don't want to get to a point where we have 10 options that we're evaluating, because I think it's pretty clear what we need to do.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, great. And then just I probably know the answer to this, but a bypassable route on the PPAs is not something you'd want to take up.","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that is an option but we'll have to investigate it and see what actually that means for the company financially but that is an option that has been initially discussed, but whether that prevails or not, we'll just have to take a look and see.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent.

And do you need to have a bill submitted in order for the government to call a special session?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll have to take a look at that. I don't know. Do we have any of our...","Brian X.

So there's no deadline for legislation being introduced.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then I guess the second question is, if you go this route and this whole FERC process doesn't work out, are you still subject to the refund that they discussed in the order yesterday?","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing's been collected yet, so there's nothing to refund.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But their refund order stays in effect if we were to begin collecting, but given what they said about the waiver, we can't begin collecting because we can't implement the PPA.

Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No problem there.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","And then totally different topic. Do you have any comments or thoughts from the Senate Energy Bill that has been passed there and needs to go to reconciliation?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think certainly Senator Murkowski has been working very hard to get bipartisan support for the bill has energy efficiency provisions, has provisions for the grid in terms of certainly the focus on making sure the grid is reliable. I think that's a good bill. And obviously, it has to go to conference and Fred Upton has been working on the other side on the House side. So they'll have to put those two together and they're very different in some respect. So we're going to have to work through that process, but overall, though, anything that Congress and the Senate can do to come together from a bipartisan standpoint to focus on reliability of the grid, integration of all these activities that we are having to deal with is a good thing, and I think it's a good start. Now, there's some heavier lift issues that eventually will need to be addressed but you got to start somewhere, and I think Lisa Murkowski has done an incredible job \u2013 I think it's Cantwell on the other side of the aisle \u2013 but it's good to see.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Is it premature to discuss what sort of impact it might have on your company, the bill, in terms of incremental CapEx?","Nicholas K.

How are you doing?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just fine.","Michael Simon Worms - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Nick, I think with regard to potential for re-regulation, I believe you've indicated earlier that there is not enough generation to meet load. And so I guess the question would be under such a scenario, what would the impact be to the consumer in terms of building out the system to meet the load relative to what the market pricing is today under the current environment?","Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we haven't neither created nor destroyed capacity out in the market. So there may have to be interim solutions of capacity to get through until the state can actually decide what does an integrated resource plan look like for the state going forward. So the capacity is probably available but because we transferred our capacity as well and retired capacity, we'll need to make sure we have a plan to recover from that.","I think from the customer standpoint, to put new capacity in place or buy existing capacity that's out on the market, would be a positive thing to provide certainty in terms of their bills in the future. And I just see a very volatile future for Ohio customers and usually that volatility happens at bad times, where customers can here afford to be able to pay a bill, I think. The utility sort of focus, as particularly an integrated utility is sort of a big budget biller. And when you open it up to market forces, the budget biller is not in the game anymore. So I think there's value in that.","Michael Simon Worms - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2016 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, once again, for joining AEP\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I\u2019m very pleased to report that AEP finished the year off strong with GAAP earnings coming in at $0.76 per share and operating earnings at $0.67 a share versus $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively, in fourth quarter 2015.","This brings the year-to-date earnings to $1.24 per share GAAP and $3.94 per share operating for the year compared to $4.17 per share and $3.69 per share, respectively, for 2015. So, overall, finishing up strong in 2016 due to some tax-related settlements.","Of course, the GAAP difference between 2015 and 2016 was primarily driven by the write-off we took in third quarter 2016 of the mainly Ohio competitive generation. This was a year of reducing risk and volatility of earnings for the company in the future and reinforcing our balance sheet to provide a strong platform for future growth. We also increased our dividend 5.4% in 2016 and improved our overall regulated operating ROE.","As you know, we set operating guidance for 2017 at $3.55 to $3.75 per share with the $3.65 mid-point due to the rebasing after the unregulated generation asset sale and establishing a long-term future growth rate of 5 to 7%. We continue to reaffirm this guidance range and long-term growth rate.","Load growth, as Brian will discuss in more detail later, was positive for the first quarter in over a year but was still minimal. So we continue to watch the economy closely particularly now that we have a new presidential administration with a pro-growth agenda. President Trump\u2019s focus of enhancing the ability for manufacturing industries to thrive and produce jobs, well that's AEP\u2019s service territory, his focus on balance portfolio of energy resources including fossil fuels that's also AEP\u2019s service territory. So as I said before the election whether focused on the Clean Power Plan as in Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals or President Trump\u2019s proposals, AEP should prosper and we are very much looking forward to working with the Trump administration to bring prosperity and jobs back to this country.","There are several key areas regarding Trump initiatives that make us optimistic concerning the future of AEP, namely focus on infrastructure development, including the electric system, truly all of the above strategies regarding generation resources, reduction of regulatory burdens for permitting etcetera, expansion of the US manufacturing base, security of the nation, in our case cyber and physical security and the creation of jobs overall. All of these bode well for AEP service territory and the economy as a whole. And of course, tax reform is on everyone's mind but because we have positioned AEP well with relatively little debt at the parent level and a strong balance sheet metrics as well, AEP should be in good shape based on our analysis of potential outcomes. Brian will discuss this issue in more detail in a few minutes.","2016 has been a pivotal year for AEP. Three years ago we were talking to you all about the daunting task ahead of us in light of the Ohio moved to deregulation and there was a legitimate concern whether AEP can deliver a 2016 that met our objectives of consistent earnings growth and dividend growth trajectory which is the hallmark of our premium regulated energy company. I'm very proud of our employees, management and Board to work together to deliver strong operating results in the face of the headwinds that occurred during the years preceding 2016.","This has been a year of repositioning and derisking the company to provide a firm foundation for financial stability, earnings and dividend growth as well as a refocus on our customer. We have come through with flying colors but as a premium energy regulated company, our work is far from done. Yes, there have been challenges but there is no question AEP has set a firm foundation for the future and I personally feel really good about that.","So let's talk about a few of the things that are ongoing. First, regarding the disposition of the sale of the competitive generation Ohio, the first group of generation, which we formally called the non-PPA assets, that has been sold to Lightstone should be completed very soon. We just obtain the FERC approval for transfer as well as other prerequisites for the sale and expect that to happen very soon.","I just want to take a moment to thank the employees of Gavin, Lawrenceburg, Darby and Waterford, who have made those generating stations what they are today and for being patient through a process that I know has been challenging to say the least.","It should be over very soon with the baton of leadership been passed to the capable hands of Lightstone, we wish you all the very best in the future. The strategic process also continues for the remaining competitive assets formally called the PPA assets. We continue to be in discussions with the other co-owners to make decisions regarding retirement, consolidation of interest and\/or sales to complete this process. We expect this process to be completed sometime in 2017.","Second, regarding industry restructuring in Ohio, we are having discussions with utilities and other stakeholders concerning proposed legislation to allow the utilities to continue to invest in generation resources in the state of Ohio. AEP will not invest in new generation in Ohio unless we have a clear path to recovery of our investment, so enabling legislation is critical. Because AEP in its shareholders have already taken a write-down on these assets, our focus is forward-looking and additive to the earnings capability of this company is successful. The process continues on pace and we expect the result from our efforts in 2017. More to come on this subject as we progress during the year.","Notwithstanding the generation issue in Ohio during the fourth quarter, we were successful in a global settlement with the parties on several outstanding cases. Some of which have been outstanding for years thereby eliminating risk to AEP Ohio into the future. Ron will also cover these settled cases in his comments. It is a great outcome because it really does provide us a clean slate in Ohio from which to continue to build our positive business case around wires related activities in Ohio such as transmission, distribution, smart grid, renewables, etcetera.","So with that, let us move to the equalizer graph. That's on page five of the package. So you can see that our overall regulated ROE is currently at 10.7%, mainly driven by weather, a little help from weather and some one-time regulatory adjustments and tax adjustments. So really a good ROE for the quarter.","Generally, we focus on these being around normally 10% level, so \u2013 and you'll see the different companies go up and down based upon where they're at in terms of ratemaking or in terms of activities that they may have ongoing from an O&M perspective. But obviously, some progress is continuing to be made relative to our regulatory recovery. You'll see that a couple of them are pretty low, Kentucky and PSO, not surprising that they'll be going in for rate cases, so I'll cover that as we go individually into each one of these companies.","Regarding Ohio Power the ROE for AEP Ohio is \u2013 at the end of the fourth quarter was 13.9%. That was primarily due to rate relief associated with the distribution investment program, shared savings attributed to the energy efficiency programs and the annual transmission formula rate true-up.","APCo, which stands at 10.3%, is obviously doing very well, primarily due to favorable taxes and continued efforts from the one-time recognition of forward billing in West Virginia and then also an increase in weather-related usage. Base rates remain frozen in Virginia as a result of the February 2015 rate freeze law, but everything is going fine there as well.","Kentucky obviously is pretty low at 7.5%. We continue close fiscal management of the O&M expenses in Kentucky. Obviously, we are trying to react to some of the recovery associated with these expenses. The ROE is at or near our projected peak with current rates. So the company will need to address this shortfall with a base rate application in 2017.","I&M achieved an ROE of 11.7% at the end of the fourth quarter 2016. I&M continues to benefit from strong revelatory frameworks in place for major capital programs across all of its business units. For 2016, I&M\u2019s earnings were positively impacted by multiple one-time tax and accounting adjustments and sales being up across all retail customer segments.","PSO \u2013 that also has an ROE that\u2019s pretty low at 8.5%, the declining ROE is primarily due to the rate relief granted by the OCC in its December final order, which was less than anticipated. PSO is in the process of preparing their next base rate case, which would be filed mid-year in response to that.","SWEPCO continues to be at 7.4%, and that range has come up a little bit. But it continues to be challenged by the weakness in oil and gas prices. You may have seen an article yesterday about Louisiana being in recession regarding to oil and gas activities. So SWEPCO is obviously feeling the brunt of that and weakness in industrial load and rate settlement with wholesale customers. They are nevertheless filing \u2013 and filed December 16 to update its Texas rates and also working on Louisiana formula based rate as well. So they are \u2013 and some transmission related activities as well. So \u2013 and there was also some intentional spending around tree trimming in those types of activities there that we needed to do and some increased O&M as well in their budget. So it is a work in progress there.","And then as far as AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at end of fourth quarter was 11.7% which they got approval of DCRF, Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing which is the first one they filed into that new regime in Texas and obviously turned out a good outcome. And then also they are experiencing some 3.1% normalized load growth over 2015 with all sectors seeing favorable load growth, so, obviously, a growing part of the territory.","AEP Transmission HoldCo, the ROE for AEP Transmission at the end of fourth quarter is 12.1%, which is driven by the ETT ROE of 12.35% and Transco ROE of 11.22%. So an ETT\u2019s 2016 ROE is certainly exceeding its authorized ROE of 9.96% so be the lower interest been, lower property taxes and no impact of accumulated deferred income tax and rate base. So they are doing very well from a transmission perspective. So that really goes to the overall 10.7%, obviously, the companies are doing well. We are working on the ones that we believe there's a path towards improvement and we will continue that effort.","So to wrap up, 2016 was a very successful year for AEP. 2017 will be another transformational year and then you would ask why. You're now a fully regulated utility. You\u2019ve made the transition but the truth be known, we spent a lot of time and energy trying to make a volatile unregulated business along with our core business growth produce outcomes consistent with the earnings and dividend growth of a fully regulated company. We are largely successful in that endeavor but risk fundamentals had to change.","So, obviously, there was never any doubt about it but just in respective of passing of Mary Tyler Moore, I will just say, we are going to make it after all. And that something I think that we will continue to strive for as we change this company. AEP has to continue to reinvent ourselves to remain relevant to our customers by investing in infrastructure and technological innovation as well as dramatically improving the customers experience as we move to a cleaner energy future. This is obviously a different focus and a different American Electric Power, the premium regulated energy company. Brian.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year. I will also provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet strength and liquidity position, discuss potential tax reform impacts and finish with a preview of 2017.","Let's begin on Slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.67 per share or $330 million compared to $0.48 per share or $233 million for 2015. As you can see, all of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter compared to last year. As did our competitive generation and marketing business.","The growth in our regulated businesses was driven by positive weather impacts, a lower effective tax rate and rate impacts that reflected increased investment to serve our customers. The quarterly comparison in the transmission and distribution utilities segment was negatively impacted by a global regulatory settlement that we recently filed in Ohio. However, this settlement closes 17 cases and largely clears the deck of lingering historical rate cases. Many associated with regulatory transition in the state.","Hearings on the settlement were earlier this week and we expect an order before February 28. The agreement covers the capacity pricing case, the retail stability writer case, the Phase-In Recovery Rider case, the double counting of capacity issue, and several historical fuel cases, as well as two significantly excessive earnings test cases. We appreciate the hard work of interveners and commission staff to help resolve these issues globally.","Now, we have a healthy AEP Ohio wires company with little financial overhang from the regulatory transition. It was a long road, but we have finally arrived at a steady state of electric utility regulation in Ohio. AEP Ohio will focus is capital investment on transmission and new distribution technologies to improve reliability to better serve our customers.","For the quarter the Generation and Marketing segment improved $0.08 per share over last year, due to lower depreciation expense from the competitive units, as well as increased earnings from our retail business. Corporate and Other was down $0.01 per share largely from the sale of our River Operations business in 2015.","Turning to Slide7, our annual operating earnings were $3.94 per share or $1.9 billion compared to $3.69 per share or $1.8 billion in 2015. Similar to the quarterly comparison, all or our regulated segments experienced growth for the year, however the sale of our River Operations business in 2015 and the expected revenue challenges in our competitive generation and marketing business combined for a $0.31 drag on the annual comparison.","The growth in our regulated segments was largely driven by rate changes from recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers, increased earnings in our transmission business, a lower effective tax rate and weather. For several years now our employees have been planning for the revenue challenges associated with the full transition to market in Ohio.","Looking at the annual results for the competitive generation and marketing segment, it is clear how dramatic these challenges were for 2016 alone recognizing that this was the final year of a multiyear transition.","Looking at this slide, it is equally how well the women and men of American Electric Power have responded to the challenge. Through continuous improvement, strategic procurement initiatives and spending discipline, they have reinvested in our regulated businesses to better serve our customers. I am proud and grateful for what they've accomplished over the last several years.","Now, let's take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance. Starting with the lower rate chart, our normalized retail sales grew by 0.3% for the fourth quarter. As Nick said earlier, this was the first quarter in over a year where we experienced growth in overall retail sales. For the year, our normalized retail sales declined by 0.2% due to lower industrial sales, partially offset by growth in commercial sales.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were down 2% for the quarter, giving back some of the gains from earlier in the year. For the year, residential sales were essentially flat. Customer counts for the system were up 0.2% in 2016. The relatively strong growth in our Texas territory was offset by the week performance in the Appalachian coal regions.","In the upper right chart, commercial sales grew by 2.6% for the quarter and ended the year up 0.9% compared to last year. For the quarter, every operating company posted positive growth in their commercial sales. For the year, the results were mixed but followed a similar pattern as described earlier for the residential sector, with the strongest growth coming from our transmission and distribution utilities segment.","Finally, in the bottom left, industrial sales increased by 0.4% this quarter and ended the year down 1.4%. 2016 was a challenging year for manufacturing within our service territory with lower energy prices, a strong dollar and week global demand. We started to see slight improvement in these areas, as we finished the year and are more optimistic about our industrial sales class outlook for 2017.","Slide 9 demonstrates how different the various regional economies of our service area performed throughout the year. On the top left of the slide, AEP\u2019s eastern service territories have experienced GDP growth of between 1.2% and 1.5% since the fourth quarter of 2015. This growth has trailed that of the U.S. by about 0.5 percentage point. This is not surprising, given the exposure that Kentucky and West Virginia have to coal mining.","The textbook definition of a recession is a period with two or more consecutive quarters of GDP contraction. AEP\u2019s western service areas have been in recession throughout 2016. GDP growth was weakest in the second quarter of 2016 and has experienced modest improvement since. This mirrors the pattern of oil prices in 2016 and is not surprising given the high concentration of oil and gas activity in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas.","Looking at the eastern vertically integrated utilities in the upper right, Indiana and Michigan Power Company has experienced strong GDP growth of between 2% and 3% in 2016, driven by its exposure to the growing auto industry. This is in contrast to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power with their exposure to coal mining. Appalachian Power return to growth in the third quarter of 2016 and has been improving since. Kentucky Power has reduced its contraction in the fourth quarter and is forecasted to return to growth in the second quarter of this year.","On the bottom left, both SWEPCO and Public Service of Oklahoma were in recession in 2016. SWEPCO returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and PSO is expected to do so in the first quarter of this year. Improving oil and natural gas prices are helping to lift these regional economies. This is expected to continue in 2017.","Finally, looking at Transmission and Distribution Utilities on the bottom right, AEP Texas, which also has significant oil and gas exposure, was in a mild recession in 2016 but emerged in the fourth quarter as oil and gas prices rose. AEP Ohio on the other hand has been in expansion mode throughout 2016 driven by growth in the construction and healthcare sectors. It is interesting to note that over 70% of all jobs added in our service area in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas.","Now let's move on to Slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased by 8\/10 of a percent during the quarter to 55.9%. The asset impairment in the third quarter of 2016 had about a 200 basis point impact on this ratio. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.8 times and 20.2% respectively.","Our qualified pension funding improved a percentage point to 96%. Although plan assets decreased during the quarter, plan liabilities decreased more primarily due to the sharp rise in the discount rate in November. Our OPEB funding improved 3 percentage points to the end of the year to end the year at 107%. November sharp increase in the discount rate benefited our OPEB funding more than our pension funding due to the lower fixed income allocation in OPEB assets.","Plan assets decreased by 4% during the quarter, while plan liabilities decreased by 7%. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans for 2017 is expected to be about $15 million.","Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.7 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities. Nick mentioned earlier that the sale of the competitive assets is expected to close in the very near future. Let me give some color on the immediate use of cash from the sale. The cash coming in the door will be approximately $2.2 billion. We will refund approximately $1 billion of commercial paper, repay the $500 million AEP generation resources term loan facility, as well as about $200 million in debt associated with the Lawrenceburg generating facility. This activity will leave us well positioned to execute our capital plan and is expected to improve our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio by about 200 basis points.","Turning to Slide 11, we have gotten a number of questions regarding tax reform since the likelihood of it actually happening has increased. As many of you know, I profess to be intellectually challenged in regard to tax issues, but I will share with you AEP\u2019s expected positioning as explained to me by our tax experts.","First, in regard to the prospect of the elimination of interest expense deductibility, AEP has less than $1 million of debt that is not subject to rate regulation. The majority of the debt we hold is at the operating company level where the elimination of deductibility would be mitigated through the ratemaking process.","Second, in regards to the prospect of negative rate base implications of 100% capital expense deductibility, AEP has ample organic growth opportunities. Just as we did a little over year ago with the expansion of bonus depreciation, we would seek to use the cash freed up to reinvest in our system for the benefit of our customers.","Third, AEP has very few unused tax credits that were accumulated under the current tax rates which would be negatively impacted by the prospect of a lower corporate tax rate. Fourth, assuming the elimination of interest expense deductibility, the 100% deductibility of capital expenditures, the elimination of the manufacturing tax credit and AEP\u2019s low level of non-rate regulated debt, AEP's breakeven 10-year average tax rate would be 22%. This is positive since a reduction in the rate to 20% level is being discussed.","Finally, let's look at the potential access regulated deferred federal income taxes at a 20% rate on the right-hand side of the slide. Today our regulated deferred FIT balance is $10.5 million. At a 20% rate $4.3 billion would be excess, but $3.3 billion of that would be depreciation related and would be expected to flow back over the life of the property. This would leave about $1 billion in unprotected access that we\u2019d need to flow back to our customers over some negotiated period of time. We would make the case that we should flow this excess back to customers at a pace consistent with the originally expected reversal period. In 1986, we negotiated flow-back periods of between 2 and 18 years.","In total, we believe that a globally competitive tax rate is good for the American businesses that we serve with some legislative adjustments for our historically regulated utility with some reasonable jurisdictional treatment of excess deferred tax flow-back to customers. And with AEP\u2019s current low-risk balance sheet, we believe the company is competitively positioned for the prospect of corporate tax reform.","We are actively engaged with industry peers and legislators and trying to sleep legislation that is both positive for the country and takes into account the idiosyncrasies of our regulated industry. With that overview, please save your really hard tax questions for Betty Jo.","Let\u2019s try to wrap up my remarks on Slide 12. We began 2017 with a strong track record. Regulated earnings were strong in 2016, as we continue to invest capital in our regulated businesses to better serve our customers. For several years, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. We expect to remain in that range this year.","In addition, over time, we have grown our dividend with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Last year, AEP\u2019s Board of Directors increased the dividend 5.4% on an annual basis. Looking ahead to 2017, we are reiterating our guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share.","Back in November, we indicated that we anticipated about $0.09 per share in 2017 earnings from the assets we expect to sell and we assumed a sale date of March 31. As Nick said earlier, we expect to sell those assets in the very near future, and this creates a few cents of earnings that we will need to offset.","In 2016, we demonstrated our ability to execute on our capital plan by investing $4.93 billion. In 2017, we anticipate investing $5.7 billion in capital, 95% of that in regulated businesses and 76% in wires.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first one, Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Great end of the year, guys. Good numbers. I only have one question and 27 parts on tax reform. The $2.2 billion cash coming in, you gave us $1.1 billion paying down CP, $0.5 billion for another tranche of debt and $200 million for another tranche, so that does leave some excess cash. Should we assume that gets consumed in a normal course of business for capital and dividends?","Brian Tierney","It does, Greg. We also anticipate being a tax payer by dent of the transaction so we anticipate quarterly tax payments as well and those would begin in the first quarter.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And just to be clear on your comments you made on tax, out of the gate if reform were to take the form that you use as your base case there, there would initially be a headwind associated with the return of rate base capital. But you think that you could, as most companies did in 2016, when bonus depreciation was extended, find enough customer-friendly projects to invest in that talks at that? I just want to be clear that's what you are saying.","Brian Tierney","We do, Greg, and we believe that would be for our capital spend a fairly modest percentage increase.","Greg Gordon","Okay. That was going to be my next question. Could you size the quantum of how much you would have to increase your capital spend every year to offset that?","Brian Tierney","Call it between $300 million and $400 million.","Greg Gordon","Perfect. Thank you, guys. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha ","Thank you. Good morning. Brian, can you just quantify, what were the drivers for the lower-than-expected tax in the fourth quarter? And what's the effective tax rate we should assume, 2017 and beyond?","Brian Tierney","Perfect Ali. So we said overall that the tax impact for the year was $0.17 when you include corporate and other in that as well when you are not breaking it out by segment that impact comes down to about $0.13. And let me break out for you what the composition of that is. Resolution of prior period audits was about $0.02 per share.","There was a Texas policy change that allowed for a lower taxable income that included a deduction for T&D expense that added about $0.04, some tax planning that we did that allowed some prior period charitable deductions to come through, added about $0.03 and then there were other currently accrued adjustments that mostly included tax to book differences accounted for on a flow-through basis that were about $0.04. So that's the composition of the $0.13 difference and the rate that we assume going forward is 35%.","Ali Agha","Yes. And second question in terms of Nick you'd mentioned you are working with the Ohio legislature. Can you give a sense of what exactly what it is that you would like to see change and what the mechanics would be? Would that be a new bill that they would introduce or how would this work technically?","Nick Akins","Yes. I mentioned AEP is sort of moving forward with a clean slate, so we really are focused on the ability to invest in new generation and its sort of a broad context, but certainly we want to be able to put renewables in place, perhaps natural gas, other forms of resources, distributed energy resources. Those are key areas for us in terms of the build-out of the \u2013 what we believe is the smart grid of the future and all the interoperability issues associated with it.","So we want to have provisions that may be shrinking of the needs provision of the existing legislation, for example, to allow us a more prescriptive path to the commission for recovery of those expenses. So once we \u2013 we would file something for new resource of some kind and it would go through the commission proceedings and we would be. And certainly, we\u2019d like the legislation to be prescriptive in terms of how the commission deals with that, so that it would be very clear. So we're not winding up back at the Ohio Supreme Court all the time.","That's really what we're after and some questions always come up about obligation to serve and that kind of thing, but really we're starting with a clean slate and we want to be able to \u2013 we now file these things as opposed to have some obligation to serve that looks like a re-regulation. So there's still a lot of discussions about that, but AEP certainly is focused on that provision. Because we're doing very well from the regulatory structure in Ohio relative to transmission distribution and the interface associated with that so we want to be able to augment that growth potential here in Ohio as well.","Ali Agha","Yes. And last question Brian, I just wanted to clarify a point you'd made, the fact that the merchant asset sales will happen sooner than March 31 that should resume. Did I hear that you guys felt you could offset that earlier than expected sale with other efforts or that you are just pointing out that maybe that $0.09, $0.10 number may be lower, keeps you in the range, but we should consider that in our numbers. I just want to be clear what you were saying.","Brian Tierney","It\u2019s the latter, Ali. The $0.09 that we had expected given the March 31 sale will be less. We\u2019re going to need to try to find a way to offset that, but we\u2019re still in the range.","Ali Agha","I got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on sales. Brian, I think you said you were feeling more optimistic about 2017. But when I look at the analyst day, what you are forecasting now, it seems to be a little lower and then 2016 also came in a little lower. So could you just reconcile your comment about feeling better? Is that relative to the past or relative to coming in to the Analyst Day?","Nick Akins","Relative to the past. So the slide that I took us through on the regional economies shows that through 2016 a lot of our service areas were in recession. But towards the end of 2016, they started to come out and started to show some growth. As we saw, oil and natural gas prices start to improve. We started to see improvement in the industrial regions that have exposure to oil and gas. If prices stay the same or continue to improve, we expect that trend to continue into 2017. Most of our growth in 2017 is forecasted to come from the industrial sector.","Jonathan Arnold","Right, so would you say your forecast -- you feel more conservative -- your forecast more conservative relative to what you are actually seeing now or it's similar?","Nick Akins","No. We think our forecast reflects what we\u2019re seeing right now, which is some improvement in industrial, particularly oil and gas.","Brian Tierney","We\u2019re actually seeing a lot of oil and gas projects that aren\u2019t just being talked about. They\u2019re already in the pipeline and being \u2013 and under construction of some kind. So that tells us a lot about what will actually true-up in that stream of new projects that are occurring because when we started going down in 2016 we had all these projects and at the end of 2015 that we thought were coming in 2016 but they weren\u2019t materializing or at least there was a propensity to slow them down because obviously prices were coming down.","But now we\u2019re seeing a different direction. So if you look at those underlying fundamentals relative to the automobile industry, relative to oil and gas activity starting to pick up and actually confirmed projects that are under construction, it makes you somewhat optimistic but at the same time, we are being very careful about this economy like we have been for several quarters now in terms of we really need to see a trend develop.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thank you guys and if I could just following up on the Ohio legislation. Nick can you give us a little more sense of when in the year you would anticipate this coming together and is there -- do you already have a draft bill, do you know who might sponsor it? Or are we still at the more exploratory stage?","Nick Akins","Yes, we are still in discussions with the other parties that would be involved with this thing and obviously all the utilities and others and really we have to get it nailed down on the provisions, all the provisions that will go into the bill and some parties are looking for different thing than others, so we have to manage through that process a little bit but the legislature obviously is being kept up to speed on what's going on and we are having regular meetings with leaders in the legislature. So nothing is going to happen that\u2019s really unknown at this point.","I think really a major focus right now is not to burden the legislation with provisions that may slow it down because if you start talking about reregulation or obligation to serve, all those kinds of things, it just brings in more issues associated with how, okay, do you actually restructure this market, but if it's surgical in terms of its approach and actually there may be other surgical provisions of other companies want, let's put those together and move forward very quickly through the legislature. So I'm still thinking probably second quarter, we will have something that we can have someone sponsor.","Jonathan Arnold","So Q2, a bill material and then we start to see the shape of it?","Nick Akins","Yes, again, there's already drafts of legislation that are circulating around and we just need to make sure all the parties are comfortable with that. And so it is a work in progress with the new legislature as well here in Ohio and from AEP's perspective, like I said, its additive to our ability to invest in this state. We already have some measure of renewables that are in place and we have to bid for those and that kind of thing but this is really centered on ensuring that we're able to address really what Ohio wants to do regarding its energy future, and our part in it. And so, that's where it stands right now.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning. Maybe to just follow-up on the last question to, if you permit me, you mentioned burdensome provisions. Can you elaborate a little bit? What would you not want to see as part of this that might get it dragged down vis-a-vis timing or ultimately palatability and I have got a few others.","Nick Akins","Yes. I think from AEP's perspective and obviously you'll have to ask the others, but from AEP's perspective to try to have AEP Ohio responsible for capacity in the future. I mean, we sort of lived through that and done that and obviously if you try to have AEP Ohio responsible for capacity and having to go out or \u2013 because obviously we're in the process of selling our generation, so you could wind up in a situation where we have long-term large PPAs and that would be a balance sheet issue for AEP Ohio.","So you think about that obligation and of course the obligation to serve in, and it becomes pretty onerous in terms \u2013 not only in terms of how we deal with the financial picture of AEP Ohio going forward, but also in terms of you're trying to restructure a market and everyone, if you try \u2013 if you put that \u2013 invest it back with the utilities then you would basically have to go through a whole lot of discussions with multiple parties of what does that mean and how do you deal with that completely different structure, short of re-regulation. So if it's more surgical in its approach in terms of new facilities or that kind of thing, then I think it's a lot easier.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it but no opposition to nuclear, for instance?","Nick Akins","Well, I'll let FE speak on the nuclear point, but we'll say this from AEP's perspective, if there is support \u2013 and I don't call it like New York or Illinois, but if there is support in terms of ZEC or something like that for nuclear, I'm supportive of that being in legislation as long as ZEC gets attributable to FE's connected customers.","And so, because we're a little different in Ohio than the other states. AEP Ohio doesn\u2019t have any nuclear and the others don\u2019t either. So I think you have to sort of think about that. But overall I\u2019m very supportive of nuclear. I think it\u2019s a travesty that these nuclear units are getting retired. And if there is any kind of state support that can be given to support these nuclear units, that\u2019s a good thing because this competitive market \u2013 we call it a market and PJM is not working for long-term base load capacity.","So I really believe that there should be some \u2013 there can be some provision, but the cost of that can\u2019t be borne by our customers because AEP Ohio is moving toward its own set of resources including renewables. And we want to make sure that there is the ability for us to invest in relation to impact on customer rates. So that\u2019s really long answer to the short question, but I think it says a lot in terms of where things are going.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right and if I may follow up on the Ohio side, obviously you've got a settlement here. You obviously posted pretty healthy ROEs. Can you just give us a little bit more of a summary in terms of what that settlement means vis-a-vis your prospective earnings and maybe just give us a little bit a sense of how you expect the cadence of your earnings at that subsidiary to proceed given where you stand today?","Nick Akins","Yes. I think from AEP Ohio\u2019s perspective, it certainly clears out all the overhang associated with all these cases. So it really puts us in a great position I mean, obviously, the capacity of the Supreme Court \u2013 the Ohio Supreme Court had remanded back the issues on the capacity and the RSR payment, and it gets all that squared away. And then, of course, some other historical fuel cases are resolved too that had been hanging out for years and then as well as too excess of earnings there.","So it really provides a clean slate going forward. So I fully expect AEP Ohio to continue to be a very good investment from a wires perspective. Transmission and distribution that we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 and I think the commission is somewhat responsive to this, and that is with the Smart Cities challenge in Columbus, we are working on interoperability with the grid, going back to transportation, and we want to be able to do that throughout our territories.","But certainly Ohio and Columbus, Ohio, is central to that theme going forward. And I really believe we\u2019ll have a supportive commission in that regard. So I think that really bodes well for the investment potential in AEP Ohio, but also the benefits for customers and the commission should be very happy with that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning, and congratulations on a solid year.","Nick Akins","Thanks.","Paul Ridzon","Looking at, I think it's slide 9, your economic forecast, you issued guidance November 1, before the election, before OPEC had cut production. Is there a tailwind now hidden in the midpoint of your guidance here. Obviously you've got one offset on the timing of the sale, the generation, but it looks like the world has improved since you gave guidance.","Brian Tierney","Yes, so it has right, as you look at the trends of what's happened with GDPs there they seem to be coming from contraction into growth and we've reflected that in the update for our numbers. You will see on Slide 8, our numbers are slightly different than what they were on page 24 of our release at the Analyst Day but what that really reflects is the passage of another quarter, new data being updated and us looking at the dead reckoning forecast that we have for our service areas for 2017.","Nick Akins","I think you have to look at is, I know business get repetitive quarter after quarter but these quarters are a snapshot in time that we don't see intuitively obvious long-term trends that we can really hang our head on in terms of how the year goes. So I would say if we continue to see bolstering activity in the second quarter and then we will continue looking at what that means in terms of load forecast and keep in mind too it's the mixture of load to. Weather -- if it's industrial load that's picking up, the margins on industrial load are much less than others. So you have to really look at this thing in the context of overall trends moving forward throughout the economy and will just have to take that quarter by quarter and make a determination.","Paul Ridzon","And then, on your pension discussion, I missed it, you said there would be an expense of $15 million in 2017. What was that expense and what was it in 2016?","Brian Tierney","It's the after-tax expense for both pension and OPEB, so it's after-tax O&M pension and OPEB, about $15 million and it was roughly the same in 2016.","Paul Ridzon","That is 15?","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Paul Ridzon","And then a question from my tech analyst. Now that you have got Ohio pretty much cleaned up, when do you think you can start the AMI spend?","Brian Tierney","Grid smart.","Nick Akins","Yes, the grid smart, we were set for hearing, I think it was yesterday. They delayed it until next week. So we should get a decision then and be off and running.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted a quick question on Ohio restructuring. In your discussion with the other utilities in the state, do have a sense that you all are on the same page? Are there still key issues that have to be resolved to make sure that you all are arm in arm as you think about legislation?","Nick Akins","I think, I'd say, generally, we recognize we need to be arm in arm, but there's still outstanding issues that we need to resolve. And \u2013 but I really believe that the participants are motivated to move this process forward because they understand the importance of the restructuring effort here in Ohio. So I'd say the parties are motivated, but still there's issues that we have to resolve specifically related to if it's a surgical legislation.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And then tax reform, I think we are all trying to get our arms around the implications and the slide you laid out was very helpful. When we think about -- you laid out your breakeven tax rate at 22% and maybe just a dumb mechanical question, but there's some discussion that maybe the corporate tax rate goes down to 25% and not 20% or 15%. If it were at 25% instead of the 20%, could you just talk through some mechanically earnings power and other impacts from that kind of an outcome?","Brian Tierney","Yes, so if it's 25% rather than 22% or less, it means that from a net income standpoint the takeaways that we would have from interest deductibility would not outweigh the reduction in the tax rate that we're talking about. Does that make sense?","Stephen Byrd","Okay. So it would be a net drag compared to say a 22% or 20% outcome and we could try to mechanically how to trace that out?","Brian Tierney","Correct.","Stephen Byrd","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Good morning. Hi. First, thank you for setting a high bar on tax reform disclosures. We will see if others can get close to this, thanks. A couple questions. On the former PPA assets, could you give us an update on resolving the future of those?","Nick Akins","Yes. On the former PPA assets, as I mentioned, we\u2019re talking to the other parties. And really it focuses on what the swap potential is and, of course, looking at units that may \u2013 I mean, you look at him and say, well, we should go ahead and retire them. And then if there is consolidation of interest, then is there a strategic process that needs to continue in some variation associated with those.","And I would say those conversations are going very well. Timing of those conversations I still suspect we\u2019ll be completing something certainly in 2017. So obviously it\u2019s pretty complicated given that there is multiple owners. But also there is multiple issues to be dealt with in terms of how you move forward from whatever the result maybe of the discussions with the parties themselves. But I would say those conversations are going very good.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Secondly, just on the transmission business, you had that 206 filing. And then, I think, did you make the 205 filing?","Nick Akins","We did.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Nick Akins","We did the 205 filing.","Steve Fleishman","And is there any updates on either of those or is that just going to be a long process?","Nick Akins","Yes. On the 205 filing, I think, we have \u2013 it's a March timeframe for, I guess, for the forecast to act and then the 206 filing that\u2019s still sitting out there. And it may be a couple years. But obviously that process will continue, if they decide to set it for hearing or whatever. But we haven\u2019t heard anything else on there.","Steve Fleishman","And then lastly, is there any update on your renewables investment program that the $1 billion you are targeting. Are you, I think, obviously after your analyst day we had the Trump election win that was unexpected and the like. So I'm curious just how are you feeling about being able to get to the $1 billion of renewables that you are targeting?","Brian Tierney","Yes. I think Chuck still has his $1 billion number out there. I think he is probably over a third of the way. But we\u2019re going to be very selective. And as I said earlier and we have our return thresholds that we expect, and we have not changed those return thresholds. He continues to be involved with projects and if he can't make it to $1 billion, he will give it back to us and we will put it somewhere else including transmission and other places.","So I think we are going to continue with the same degree of discipline that we have today regardless of what happened to tax provisions or anything else and so it's not -- this is not where AEP is trying to form some major business. It really is focused on an augmentation that's disciplined and has a return expectation associated with it that actually contributes to what we are trying to achieve. So that process hasn't changed at all and Chuck continues to be involved with projects both solar and wind and we will continue with that.","Steve Fleishman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Hi, how are you doing. So most of the questions have been answered, but I've just got a really basic one and that is, we've seen tax reform proposals before. Obviously this seems like it's got momentum to it and it doesn't -- it looks like you guys have, your disclosure is pretty clear and the impact doesn't look necessarily huge. But it's pretty disruptive in many ways, generally speaking, to different players. And I just was wondering, when you're looking at this and when you're talking to your people, what do you think the chances are and I know it's a tough -- I'm not holding you to it or anything. But what are the chances that we actually see something this dramatic being enacted?","It just seems rather -- I don't know, we've seen it before and things don't usually happen like this. When you look at this landscape now, if you had to guess fifty-fifty, what would you say is the chance of this actually-- these proposals substantially getting enacted.","Nick Akins","I wouldn\u2019t say -- I don't know that we've had a Trump administration before too, the pace at which he is moving already and I think a lot of these things have been pinned up for years and on its face you'll say it's pretty daunting to get tax reform done in these multiple things that we are talking about particularly when you take away interest expense deductibility and issues like that. That's going to be tough.","I'm not saying that it can't get done because I think there's probably enough movement out there of a lot of companies who want to see that tax rate come down, and I think the importance of American industry going forward to be competitive internationally. I think that process will move forward and it becomes an issue of, okay, how do you pay for it? And that's where interest expense deductibility and all that kind of stuff comes in.","As far as the industry is concerned, I still think right now the Trump Administration is dealing with ACA. They \u2013 the tax reform could come after that. Although, infrastructure seems to be a key issue as well. So it remains to be seen. I think it'll probably be later in the year before we really see things that we can really latch onto to fully understand where this thing is going and so we'll continue to look at our tax situation and consideration of that but it is something we'll watch very closely.","And if it is a broad tax reform package, we probably dealt with in our analysis here, some of the extremes that would occur. If you take 100% expensing and interest expense deductions away, that's pretty considerable. So I think that's probably as much of a stress test as you're going to get. As far as the industry is concerned, and AEP's position, we would \u2013 we think that our industry is the most heavily \u2013 it is the capitalized industry by far of anyone in the US.","And when you talk about interest expense deductibility and deductions and how the impact ultimately customers, you really have to think twice about that. So I really believe there ought to be a utility exception because we typically pass our rates through to customers and the benefits in there to manufacturing and other endeavors that we have for the economy. So whether that can get done or not is another question. But certainly we really have to look at those provisions and how it applies to our capital intensive industry. And we\u2019ll obviously be active in Washington associated with that thought as well.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell ","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in, Nick. I appreciate it. I guess on Ohio restructuring, AEP is already taking the pain of getting rid of oil generation of the utility in the and maybe have not and AEP is looking more forward-looking with future generation needs potentially in this restructuring bill. Do you think we could see an Ohio back to what we had as we moved to market where the state gets split and the restructuring as differently in the northern part of the state than in the southern part of the state?","Nick Akins","I really don't see that. I think you hit up on a point though that different companies may be looking for different provisions based upon where they stand today and somehow we\u2019ve got to make sure that an industry restructuring package is transparent enough and people will understand it well enough to accommodate some of these varied interests. And that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s part of the challenge. And so we will just have to see how things work out from that perspective.","Anthony Crowdell ","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m glad your blue jackets are relevant now.","Nick Akins","Yes. I know. They are really relevant. Aren\u2019t they?","Anthony Crowdell ","Yes, they are.","Nick Akins","It\u2019s only taken like two decades.","Anthony Crowdell ","Unfortunately, at the expense of my rangers, but yes.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call.

Welcome to the second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn our conference over to our host, Treasurer, Chuck Zebula. Please go ahead.","Charles E. Zebula","Thank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me today for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and CEO; and Brian Tierney, our CFO. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thank you, Chuck Zebula. The overall, we had another good quarter for AEP. We produced GAAP and operating earnings of $0.75 and $0.77 a share, respectively, and brought our year-to-date earnings to $1.55 and $1.57 per share, respectively. So it turned out to be a pretty good quarter for us. And as Brian will discuss in more detail a little bit later, our service territory continues to show progress. Although very tenuous in the economic recovery, we continue to see industrial growth driven by primary metals and oil and gas activities, but we're now also seeing commercial growth for the first time in years. Residential continues to lag, so we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and show that sustainability, particularly from an industrial standpoint, manufacturing as well as moving to the commercial side of things and then residential will pick up as well. So hopefully this economy will continue to make progress. I know that everyone's focused on the election during this time of the year and hopefully, we'll have a return of optimism that will permeate through the economy that we deal with.","Looking at the quarter, it really does show the discipline of cost control and the diversity of the AEP system to overcome the challenges, in particular related to Ohio where our loss of the POLR charges and customer switching. Ohio has not been a good story for AEP over the last year or so, and -- but we're working really hard to turn this around. All of our other state jurisdictions have improved over the last year, but as you all know, all eyes are on Ohio and very focused on August, which we believe is August 8.","Before getting into Ohio and other issues, I want to reiterate that our strategy we put before you on February 10 is still intact and it really does bear repeating. The major issues that we're focused on is certainly movement to the competitive market in Ohio, with corporate separation and the formation of our competitive generation in retail and wholesale trading and marketing functions. That's going to be key for us to execute for in the future after we get this August 8 to order.","Investment in our regulated businesses. We will continue to invest in our regulated businesses. And as we've described, just that investment will provide for continued commitment to the growth of 4% to 6% from an earnings perspective. And we'll continue to focus on growth in our transmission business as well and repositioning that business around the critical mass to make sure earnings provide in near term, as well as long-term. And that dividend strength certainly is secured by the regulated businesses as we go forward as well.","So as we transform ourselves, certainly we'll transform from a resource perspective as well. Our generation resources in response to the EPA and certainly from the price of natural gas and other fundamental conditions out there will continue to change. But we're very focused on providing plans to really emerge as a more diversified fleet as we go forward.","So all -- so as we looked at some of the issues that we deal with during the year, it became apparent that these basic strategy components remain a focus and will really enable us to look ahead to the execution as necessary reposition the company for the future.","I've been CEO for about 8 months now and have been fortunate to preside over 2 of the most damaging storms in AEP's history. One, what I would call a regulated storm and the other, a weather-related storm. Let me cover the weather-related storm first, which I had never heard of before the storm actually occurred, a super derecho, which occurred in late, late June. I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly focus. During the day, it was a 10% chance of thunderstorms. Well, that was a pretty damaging 10%. 6 of AEP states from Indiana to Virginia were affected and some 1.4 million customers. And additional 300,000 customers were affected in the follow-up storms that ensued. We marshaled crews from our Western footprint and certainly from the indigenous operating companies that were affected, but also all of the country, from California and elsewhere, and in Canada as well to support the restoration efforts. I'm very proud of our response. And our management team, included -- including myself, visited with crews working throughout our various states to make absolutely sure that the necessary resources were dedicated, restoring power to our customers. Working for almost 2 weeks, 16-hour days and almost a 100-degree heat was an extreme challenge that I'm confident that we performed and executed well from an operational and a safety perspective.","The storm was expensive, approximately $230 million, much of which will be deferred for future recovery as Brian will provide more detail on a little bit later, but it is and in an odd and perhaps, morbid way, it gave the management team a brief reprieve from the challenges of the other storm that occurred -- the regulated storm we call Ohio. So let's talk about that one.","These clouds are starting to clear up as well. The capacity order of the PCO demonstrated a couple of major points. The Commission is focused on providing competitors the ability to compete quickly for customers by putting in place RPM pricing provisions. And they're also focused on the financial integrity of AEP, evidenced by the capacity cost being set at 189 per megawatt day, with the deferral mechanism to be resolved in the ESP filing. That's the first step. So after a significant belly blow in February, AEP is back on its feet and have taken the first step. Now comes the important part, the second step to demonstrate that we're walking again before we run. The August order, we presume, will come out August 8. That order for the ESP will need to -- needs to define several key issues: the deferral mechanism for the capacity cost delta from the RPM rates; the level of the RSR, the rate stability rider, to ensure the financial integrity of AEP; the distribution investment rider. And we'll also need to define the start of the recovery of the deferred fuel that's been on the books for quite a while. The other major issue is corporate separation. We'll need to get the approval for that, and we expect that as well.","Overall, we need to address the financial needs of AEP Ohio and the ensuing corporate separation to ensure the credit quality and the cash requirements are met for the emerging entities. You can't start a generation company with a fistful of deferral IOUs. We must have cash as well to solidify the balance sheets of the Genco and AEP Ohio going forward.","So make no mistake. Your AEP is focused on emerging from this storm with a financially secure company and a clarification of execution to move toward a competitive market in Ohio. The development of our retail effort continues to move forward positively. I recently visited our team in Chicago, the former BlueStar team, and they are very focused on advancing the retail efforts, but they're also focused on margins. That's one key issue I'm not interested in signing up every customer we can sign up. I'm interested in margins associated with that because we are providing a hedge, ultimately for the generation that separated, so we want to maximize value associated with that.","So now we need the structural pieces of the unregulated generation fleet to fall into place so that we can effectively hedge and compete so that this supply. And as we discussed with you all in February, so for AEP, all of our sites are set on moving forward. We continue to see 4% to 6% long-term growth, dividend supported by the regulated companies and do not perceive the issuance of equity during this transition. We are not likely to issue guidance until after the commission renders an order on any rehearing request so by then, we may be looking at '13 and '14 projections but I have a feeling you all are looking at that already anyway.","So with all that said, we do continue on a very positive path in other aspects of our long-term strategy as well. Our transmission efforts continue to move forward. As examples, we are now turning dirt on some significant projects of a cell substation in Ohio, that's a $239 million investment; a $200 million project in Indiana; and another $200 million of major projects throughout our Transcos, as well as the Prairie Wind construction is now turning dirt. So we're starting that process of construction that really can provide the earnings growth for the future.","We are very disappointed in the order yesterday regarding the Pioneer Project. Both the technical and factual basis, we believe, was not fully recognized in the order. The new line doesn't even interconnect with the EPSCO, only Duke and AEP. And you can't interconnect AEP's 765 KV into an EPSCO's 138 KV system. That's -- technically, that just doesn't work very well. And that we have a substation pretty close to that, that's accommodating to our 765 KV. So really, look at those factual issues needs to be revisited. Overall, a decision really sends a wrong message to promoters of transmission solutions. So we're evaluating our options on this as we go forward, but certainly we'll make our position known both publicly and probably through filings as well.","However, this doesn't impact the AEP earnings forecast for transmission because as we described earlier, we're repositioning the transmission business to focus on short-term, as well as long-term projects to provide the critical mass for earnings growth, so we have plenty of projects to take its place. That project management discussion we had earlier, along with the amount of projects that are being placed in near-term perspective from a Transco and other longer term projects perspectives, we'll be able to certainly focus on an earnings path and secure that for the future.","So we spent so much time on Ohio. We forget there are other state regulatory matters that are moving forward. Our Indiana rate case, the $170 million rate case, has concluded as hearings and we expect an order by the end of 2012. Intervener exceptions are due August 15. We submitted our version of what the order should look like, so we'll look to that toward the end of this year. The Turk ultra supercritical pulverized coal station is now 92% complete, and we're looking forward to the first fire in the boilers so that we can move on with getting that unit to operational and into rates in those various jurisdictions.","Also, we continue our focus on further developing our EPA response plans. We now estimate our capital spend to be approximately $6 billion, could be a little bit higher than that but nominally, $6 billion over the next 5-or-so years to accommodate the retrofits and retirements of our generation facilities. We continue to be focused on legislation to provide for a 2-year extension so that we can ensure reliability and reduce the cost of compliance. That makes a lot of sense for our ultimate customers and the economy in general.","And lastly, I'll talk about our repositioning study. We have engaged MacKenzie and Associates to work with us on our plan to refocus our business on growth and efficiency of operations and enable us to do -- to continue to prioritize our business functions around the opco [operating company] model and the growth engines of transmission and the development of competitive businesses. Our growth will continue to be fueled by the regulated business, but we must optimize our cost structure to enable more investment for earnings growth. We expect to conclude this study by the end of the year, with sustainable -- with a sustainable process and organizational value that begins in 2013. So again, all eyes are on August 8. We assume and then expect -- we expect expedient and deliberate execution and progress toward the strategic goals that we've discussed.","And now, I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick. Turning to Slide 4. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $370 million, up $18 million from the prior year's level of $352 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of $0.04 per share from the second quarter of 2011.","In summary, the favorable effect of lower O&M expense was partially offset by an increase in the impact of customer switching to alternative electric suppliers in Ohio.","The quarter-on-quarter detail shows a decline in earnings per share of $0.08 related to the level of customer switching. In addition, this year's results were adversely affected by last year's October unfavorable decision on remand from the Public Utility Commission of Ohio related to POLR service. Last year's results included POLR revenues, while this year's do not. These unfavorable drivers were more than offset by lower O&M expense and favorable other items. O&M expense was down for the quarter, adding $0.13 per share to earnings. The lower O&M reflects decreased planned outage work and lower storm expenses compared to 2011. In addition, the unfavorable variance in O&M spending reflects management efforts to maintain tight controls on spending across the organization. The $0.04 per share improvement in other items reflects the favorable effect of a partial reversal of a 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.","At the beginning of the call, Nick mentioned the devastating storms that hit our eastern service territory beginning on June 29. In addition to being destructive, the storms were also costly. As Nick said, current estimates of the storms' total cost were about $230 million, spread across our Eastern operating companies. We believe approximately $70 million will be classified as capital and will be recovered in various future rate proceedings. Of the remaining $160 million of O&M, we believe we'll ultimately be able to defer for future recovery up to $130 million. We recognize $4 million in expenses related to the series of storm in the second quarter, leaving an estimated remaining expense for the third quarter of about $26 million.","Turning to Slide 5. Operating earnings for the year-to-date period were $759 million, up $15 million from last year's level of $744 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $1.57 for the year-to-date, an increase of $0.02 per share from 2011.","Similar to our discussion of the second quarter results, the year-to-date results reflect favorable lower O&M expense, offset by the effect of customer switching in Ohio, the unfavorable POLR decision and mild first quarter weather. In detail, weather adversely affected the year-on-year results by $0.12 per share. While the weather impact in the second quarter was comparable, the effect of the mild winter throughout our service territory is evident in the year-to-date results. Customer switching for the first 6 months of the year was -- has lowered earnings by $0.13 per share. By the end of June, 34% of AEP Ohio load had switched to alternative suppliers. The effect of the unfavorable POLR decision adversely affected earnings by $0.10 per share.","On the positive side, rate changes net of POLR have supported earnings by $0.07 per share; O&M expenses are favorable by $0.25 per share, driven by lower spending related to planned outages and our overall efforts to control costs; finally, other items added $0.05 per share to the results, largely due to the partial reversal of the 2011 fuel provision in Ohio.","On Slide 6, you'll see on the bottom right quadrant that weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1% for the quarter and 3\/10 of 1% for the year-to-date period. The growth is coming from sales to the commercial and industrial classes, while normalized residential sales continue to struggle.","Before I get into the period variances by customer class, let me give you an overview of the economy in our service territory. We continue to see economic improvement, although the growth is not evenly distributed across our service areas. One of the best indicators of relative strength of the local economy is employment growth.","Over the past 3 months, employment growth in AEP's metropolitan areas has increased 2%, which is better than it's been over the past year and stronger than the 1.4% employment growth for the U.S. in total.","The employment situation remains weaker in our eastern service territories, where there are approximately 91,000 fewer jobs than before the recession began, and the unemployment rate is 7.9%. That being said, employment growth in our East Region is up 1.8% over the past 3 months.","Job growth in our western service territory has been stronger. Over the past 3 months, employment growth in our Western Region has been 2.3% above last year. Current numbers indicate there are 17,000 more jobs than when the recession began. The strongest improvement has been in Texas, with job growth of 2.9% over the past 12 months, and current employment numbers indicate there are 26,000 more jobs now than at the prerecession peak.","Now let's look at the customer classes. The industrial sector posted the ninth consecutive quarter of growth since the recession. Industrial sales are up 1.8% for the quarter and 2% for the year, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors. I'll talk more about this in more detail on the next slide.","On the top right of the slide, AEP sales to commercial customers grew 1.6% for the second quarter and are 6\/10 of 1% up for the year. Commercial sales growth closely tracks employment growth. The employment growth we discussed earlier is driving the recovery we are experiencing in this class. Not surprisingly, commercial sales have been stronger in our West Region and especially in Texas where the job growth has been the strongest.","AEP's weather-normalized sales to residential customers were down 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. Part of this is driven by customer accounts. In our eastern service territory, we have approximately 4,000 fewer customers than we had last year. Our Texas properties experienced a notable increase in residential customer counts. This was related to strong employment and population growth.","The chart on Page 7 shows the growth in industrial sales for our 5 largest sectors. As you can see, year-to-date growth in primary metals is 1.4%, yet  sales to the sector declined in the second quarter. Our largest metals customer was still ramping up to full production during the first quarter of last year. More recent data shows that the primary metals sector has stabilized at roughly 75% of the prerecession level.","Also on this chart, you'll notice that sales in the petroleum and coal products sector had been improving, with sales up 8% in the second quarter and 7.1% for the year-to-date period. While growth in this sector has been solid across our territory, there was a major expansion at a refinery in East Texas that drove much of the growth for the quarter.","Besides the sectors shown on the chart, we are also seeing impressive growth in a couple of other sectors. Oil and gas extraction sales are up 1.3% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date. In addition to new customers, several existing customers have expanded their current operations. Most of these expansions are related to the shale gas activity, particularly in our Wheeling,  West Virginia and Texas territories.","The transportation equipment manufacturing sector, which represents 4.2% of the company's industrial sales, has also demonstrated a significant increase of 10.9% for the quarter and 8.7% for the year-to-date period. This improvement is related to U.S. auto sales, which reached their prerecession annualized levels earlier this year. We have experienced load growth at existing automotive manufacturers in West Virginia and Louisiana. In addition, drivers in the U.S. are maintaining and not replacing their vehicles as often as they used to. This has resulted in growth at some of our motor vehicle parts manufacturers, especially in Michigan and Ohio.","Turning to Slide 8, you can see that as the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, our natural gas capacity factors have increased. For both  quarterly and annual periods, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 80%. For our East combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and Warrensburg plants, East combined cycle generation has increased 250% for the quarter and 181% for the year-to-date period. With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70%, the ability to realize incremental coal-to-gas switching within our Eastern fleet is reduced.","This switching and the general pricing environment for coal, natural gas and electricity has led to an increase in our coal inventory from 45 days at the end of the first quarter to 48 days at the end of the second quarter. This is about 6 days more inventory than at the end of the second quarter of last year. Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged and our needs for 2013 are about 90% hedged with many units fully hedged.","On Slide 9, you will see that our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity remained strong. Our debt to total capitalization has remained fairly constant over the last 3 quarters and currently stands at 55.2%. Our FFO to interest coverage and our FFO to total debt remain solidly BBB for a company with AEP's business risk profile. The company's net available liquidity stands at $2.8 billion, and is supported by our 2 large credit facilities, which mature in June of 2015 and July of 2016.","That being said, there are some pending developments that could impact the credit quality of Ohio Power Company, specifically, the capacity case allows for the deferral of the difference between $189 a megawatt day and the RPM price. It is our belief that the ESP order will address the recovery mechanism for the deferral of these costs in addition to other items. Unfortunately, at this point, we do not know how or when the deferral will be recovered. Both timing and recovery are important items in determining the credit outlook.","The credit risks for Ohio Power had been outlined by all 3 rating agencies. Earlier this month, S&P issued a bulletin immediately after the capacity order, stating that while there are no immediate effects on ratings, they considered deferrals of changes and capacity prices to be unsupportive of credit quality because cash flow would decline and could result in financial measures inconsistent with the current rating. We have informed stakeholders about the importance of supporting investment grade ratings for Ohio Power. In addition, the balance sheet for this company is able to absorb some level of deferrals, especially if we are able to begin recovery of our deferred fuel costs and securitize our existing regulatory asset balances. These last 2 items will be credit supportive. They are likely both positive and negative items to appear on the credit scorecard for Ohio Power, yet the overall tally is not known.","However, our metrics are solid today and we have a focus on reducing our business risk in Ohio through the transfer of 2 large plants to regulated affiliates, sizing our cost structure to a competitive environment and hedging our output. As Nick said, we are committed to investment grade credit and at this time do not see the need for additional equity beyond the DRIP due to some flexibility in our capital spend profile and securitization opportunities in both Ohio and West Virginia. Our Ohio team is working hard to achieve an outcome in our ESP case that preserves the financial strength of Ohio Power and our new competitive generation company.","Turning to Slide 10, for the remainder of 2012, I have already detailed the estimated cost impacts of the late June and early July storms. We have shown where the economy is recovering in our service territories and the resulting impact on load. The industrial and commercial load classes are headed in the right direction, yet recent residential load trends had been weak. Regulatory uncertainty in Ohio has been a concern for the AEP story for some time. In early June, we started to get some clarity on Ohio regulatory outcomes, but a big piece of that picture is expected to come with an order in early August. We are working hard to get a reasonable outcome. Our earnings so far this year had been the result of positive non-Ohio utility performance and expense discipline, offsetting earnings challenges in Ohio. We will maintain that discipline. Most of all, we are looking forward to being able to share with you a plan in Ohio that has a clear, reasonable transition to a competitive generation model and a stable regulated wires company with a financially sound AEP Ohio throughout the transition period.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Kordell from Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I have a question on customer switching. And I believe on the call you had said that about 34% of your Ohio customers have switched, and I want to know how that compares to the expectation you guys filed in Ohio, and I believe that was Bill Allen's testimony. Are you in line with that or are you -- is switching ahead of what you guys are forecasting?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think it's lower than expectation. However, after this last order, we would expect switching to accelerate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just question number one is, O&M has been one of these great success stories for 2012 so far. Can you just maybe give a little more color on how much of the year-over-year savings is kind of durable and sustainable versus kind of timing related around maintenance schedules and that sort of thing with the fleet? And what kind of inflation we should be kind of modeling off in this level?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, Dan. We've had some pretty good savings. Actually our employees have responded quite credibly to the reductions from the Ohio-related activities and we have adjusted. Some of those -- the majority have been a sustainable type of reductions, although some of them are not, and such as you have a deferral of outages and those types of things. But that's the whole reason why we're having the repositioning study done, where we're going through and defining sustainable cost reduction opportunities, either through process-related activities or organizational activities. And we recognize that cost cutting -- we can't continue a process of cost cutting and cost cutting. We have to have a view going forward of sustainable reductions that provide us a base where we can continue to progress as a company. So that's what we're really focused on. Brian, you may have some additional detail.","Brian X. Tierney","No, that's it. You hit the nail on the head, Nick. When we had talked about guidance, but since it's been suspended for 2012, we talked about O&M in that $3.4 billion range. I'd probably put it in the $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion range. And with what we're doing with McKenzie, we anticipate it being in a similar range for next year.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","2 [ph] is just implied O&M next year. Okay, that's interesting. Nick, I guess with the gas plans running really well. Gas prices, low coal prices, kind of remainder cash pressures. Are you guys doing any work to reevaluate the environmental plan for EPA compliance, $6 billion as far as maybe less plant investment, more new generation? Or how is that dialogue going internally?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, that continues to be a work in progress, Dan. I mean, it changes as we get new information and it changes as a result of discussions we have with the states and with the EPA. And of course, we continue to work, as I said, on the legislative side because EPRI has done an independent analysis showing that it cost 1\/3 less if you wind up with a 2-year extension if you're able to optimize that. But I think it's important for us to go through the process in concert with the states, and it really focuses on that operating company model where we're working with them to determine what the proper solution is. And you're right, we are -- we continue to search and as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as with the Big Sandy scrubber proposal being pulled at this point, we're reevaluating that, we have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-fired generation as well that we've adjusted to do. You'll continue to see those kinds of adjustments because what we're trying to get to is: number one, a portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support; and then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So for us, it's a relatively high hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities. In some -- in many cases, it's already done. In some cases, it continues to be an evaluation, even for units such as the 1,300-megawatt units at Rockford. Paul Chodak over at I&M is working with the regulators to determine what the proper opportunities are for that so that we can meet the emission reduction guidelines, and that's being discussed in all of our jurisdictions. So you bring up a great point, and that's something that we're very focused on. And we'll continue to try to optimize, matter of fact, when we first started this process, we were looking at $8 billion, and it's come down to just over $6 billion, and we expect it to continue to be refined as we go forward in concert with the states.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just the fuel deferral reversal, I'm sorry, I missed the exact number. What was -- Brian said it and I just missed it. Could you repeat it, Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, and we didn't mention the number specifically. It's about $30 million. There was a clarification and an order that came out this year that meant that instead of having deferred $65 million, we only needed to defer the Ohio retail jurisdiction component of that, so that allowed us to reduce the Ohio deferral expense amount by $30 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And is there any ongoing impact that we should think about? Or is this just sort of a this quarter event?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, there is no ongoing effect of that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then the depreciation for shorter generation line, could you give us a sense as to what the -- what's causing that and what -- how much that was as -- in the total of $50 million increase for depreciation?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. For year-to-date, Paul, it's about $32 million, and that's associated mostly with the Ohio assets that we know will be retiring by 2015. So we had to increase the depreciation on those particular assets to that 2015 terminal date. And for year-to-date, that increase in depreciation is about $32 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, that will be going off, right? That's -- is that how we should think about it on an annual basis?","Brian X. Tierney","You should think about those increased amounts through 2014 to get to that January 1, 2015 retirement date.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, the securitization that you mentioned. You guys feel you can do that with the current legislation in place. I'm talking about the deferrals -- excuse me, on the capacity charge. Do you think you can do that with the current legislation or current -- sorry, current [indiscernible] legislation to enable that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think we could be able to do that. I mean, I think, obviously, there's different views of what the law says, but now, there's flexibility in that, and we believe we can do that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And would that be something that you think you could do before sort of all the -- because I'm just assuming that we're going to get appeals in this, considering how contentious this stuff has been. Do you think that, that would -- in terms of securitization, the timing of the potential for securitization, how should we think about that? Do you think that we have to sort of -- obviously, get through a hearing, but beyond rehearing, do you think we'd have to wait for an Ohio Supreme Court decision or -- do you follow me?","Nicholas K. Akins","Most likely we would. But nevertheless, we'd obviously start the financing and so forth associated with that. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. And, Paul, I'd like to distinguish that as the capacity -- deferral from the capacity case and distinguish that the Ohio reg assets, where we're going to file later this month to be able to securitize a little bit over $300 million of Ohio reg assets, and Ohio fuel from the 2009 through 2011 period, which is a little bit over $500 million. And we do believe that everything's in place to be able to securitize those amounts, particularly the reg assets and then the fuel pending a final order in those cases.","Nicholas K. Akins","Did you mention West Virginia?","Brian X. Tierney","Well, that's another jurisdiction altogether. In West Virginia, we think we'll be able to securitize about $400 million of deferred fuel in early 2013 as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm just curious, I noticed you didn't highlight retail rate increases as part of the -- as an individual driver and then the slides that kind of [indiscernible] -- that you went backwards in the quarter versus last year. Is that just timing or -- and how should we be thinking about rate increases as a driver of overall earnings for the year?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. In the back part of the slides, Jonathan, you'll see that we netted together POLR and rate increases. So what you're seeing is the overall negative impact of having lost the POLR outcome, but that's offsetting positive rate increases in other jurisdictions.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, we continue to benefit from rate increases in the other jurisdictions.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. [indiscernible] On sales, I guess last quarter, you sort of -- you had a weak Q1, particularly in residential, and then -- and you didn't adjust the annual forecast. And now the annual forecast is not on the slide; it's more a year-to-date number. How should we be thinking about your expectations versus the numbers you had for the year a quarter ago?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. Jonathan, we're coming in lower than what we had forecast for the year, and that's largely being driven by the residential customer class. That's part of what we're striving to offset with some of the cost reductions that we've talked about. And that lag in the residential customer classes is definitely impacting the overall retail sales on an annualized basis.","Nicholas K. Akins","Jonathan, I think, it remains to be seen what the reasons for that are. But typically, when you have industrials come off and then commercials come off afterwards and then residentials, either empty homes or people decide, \"Well, I can't find another job,\" so they leave, and so it's that piece of it. So you have this recovery that's occurring, at least we call it that at this point, with industrial being sustainable, commercial is starting to pick up, the residential hopefully would pick up as a result with the job creation that Brian had talked about previously. But the other side of the coin could be from the efficiency standpoint. Customers are -- because of the economy or because of efficient appliances and so forth, what does the future hold in terms of the residential class. So it remains to be seen, but it's something that we're watching very closely.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What's a good number for the year kind of when you aggregate industrial and residential? Is it about flat or is that a good [indiscernible] kind of what you're thinking?","Brian X. Tierney","No, I think closer to the up 5\/10 of 1% to 3\/4 of 1%.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] must be expecting residential to be a little less negative as you move into the back half of the year?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, we do so.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can I -- one other thing. Nick, you mentioned having been out and visited the people of BlueStar. Can you give a little bit more of a sense of where they are in that business plan, where you're kind of targeting, are there any wins they might have had, just a flavor of how you feel about operations there.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. It's sort of interesting when I visited. We're trying to keep this really a separate culture from the rest of the organization because we really do want to focus on that competitive environment. And walking into the place, having a lot of young people in shorts and flip-flops and -- but it is a different environment. But it's -- one, it's very focused. I mean, it's clear that they are focused on and energized by what Ohio can provide for them, particularly from the unregulated generation side to have this slug of generation being provided, they can hedge against and provide deals in the market. They are very focused and active on doing that. And one of the things that struck me in the discussions with them was how much they didn't talk about, \"Let's go get as many kilowatt hours as we can.\" That wasn't part of the deal. It was, \"Let's go get these contracts, do it wisely, do it with the controls in place, but focus on margins.\" And I think this organization, the back office system integration continues to work very well. Matter of fact, I think all of our customers are existing AEP retail customers switch over to the BlueStar systems here in the next, I think in the next week or 2 -- 2 weeks?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes.","Nicholas K. Akins","So it's happening very quickly. And of that integration process is going very well. We have AEP retail employees together with BlueStar employees now. Matter of fact, we moved several AEP retail employees to Chicago to really focus on that effort. And I see the mix of the 2 cultures going extremely well because they're fueled by the prospect of just amazing growth potential. So that's my view of it. I think it's going to be a very positive thing for us, particularly when we get the corporate separation out of the way, and they can start actually planning on doing making deals based upon the availability of that generation and long-term deals with that. While I was there, they were signing up deals. Matter of fact, they told me several deals, as I was leaving, that they were very proud of from a long-term perspective. So they are making considerable progress, and I'm happy with that progress.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are you active in the kind of high -- in the Illinois aggregation space?","Nicholas K. Akins","Oh, yes. They're -- matter of fact, they're operating in several states right now. Certainly, Illinois in a big, big way. But they're also focused on other activities, particularly in Ohio. They're ramping up for Ohio and in the process of marketing in Ohio. And we were successful in the aggregation of Upper Arlington, which was a major win for us. So they're certainly making considerable progress. Now, they're starting to think about, \"Okay, what areas do we want to focus on?\" And we've sort of -- I mean, we've told them, \"Move forward with those activities very -- as quickly as we can, but only focus on those areas that we understand.\" And that really is going to drive you toward the MISO markets, the Northeast State, they have in New York and Maryland and other retail areas as well. But we also participate in auctions, so -- as well as our own territory. And they're also faced with the prospect that we did -- we're in the process getting approval to start up our AEP retail organization back in Texas, the lower-than-1 megawatt customers, that following is waiting for the Commission approval right now. So we're very focused and they are as well. And it really is moving forward well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Looking at the coal to gas switching numbers for your combined cycle, and just wondered if you can give some color on during the peak summertime for your combined cycles, what general output level are you expecting? Are there any physical constraints or other constraints we should be thinking about?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. I think our capacity factors have been pretty high for the gas units, running in the, I guess, in the 70%, 78% to 80% capacity factor during the July time we've had thus far. And generally, around that 70% to 80% capacity factor, I think, which is sort of amazing, given what we're dealing with. I think from a coal-fired generation perspective, it's dropped off considerably. As long as you're -- we're not having sub-$3 per MBTU price, the capacity on the gas units are going to be -- continuing to be high. There's no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time. And I think our numbers were slightly down last month because that's when we took some outages on some of the gas units. But we are pleased with our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond, actually. What we're -- and just as an additional add-on to that, we are continuing to be concerned about the reliability implications or what the EPA is doing because one thing we haven't talked about is the capacity factors of those small, older coal-fired units that are depending -- dependent upon during the peak. As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system 54% of the time and are running in the order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So they're still needed. And we're going to have to work through that process. And even with those committed to provide the peak, and obviously they have minimum run-time obligations and minimum load obligations, we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas units. So that pretty well tells you we're really switching back and forth based upon what the peak requirements are but utilizing the energy component through the natural gas as much as we can.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And this builds a little on what Dan has asked earlier. Just because you think about environmental compliance but you also add on the pressure of low natural gas. You mentioned many of these units really are quite needed from a reliability point of view. Is there a chance over time that some of these smaller units will be candidates for retirement over and above what we've looked at and are reaching already or are we kind of reaching a point where we're really going to need most of those coal plants to be around from a reliability point of view?","Robert P. Powers","I think the surviving coal units, you're going to need for reliability. The smaller coal-fired units, we're going to have to step through the process and determine physically on the system, do we need capacity at those particular areas. And in many cases, these units are running with reliability must-run status during these peak months. So we're going to have to solve that equation. And that could lend itself to more natural gas-fired capacity or transmission solutions as a result. In either way, we'll benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","As Ohio starts to build out its shale presence, is that your territory?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, it is. Yes. Matter of fact, not just the Ohio shale. It's -- we have about every shale gas play there is, from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and up to the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale. So we're benefiting from that.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And you indicated a 2-year extension on EPA compliance, but now capital of 33%?","Nicholas K. Akins","Oh, what I'd said was that if we have the 2-year extension, then we have more of an ability to approach the technological side of things. And that's why I was pointing to the EPRI study, which is an independent organization, Electric Power Research Institute. They did a study and said that if you were to take an additional 2 years, by utilizing technologies, you could actually save half of the units that are scoped for retirement for that period of time and achieve the same emission reductions at a 1\/3 less costs. So instead of $300 billion cost in the country to address the EPA issues, it would cost around $200 billion, which -- that's a substantial cost savings, particularly when you talk about the impact on the economy. And as we go through this process, we're going to have to determine, with EPA and perhaps legislation would give you a lot more flexibility and a lot more security around the solutions, and that's what we're trying to achieve.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In the technology things side, are you debottlenecking of capital inputs?","Nicholas K. Akins","No. We have a plan. We have a plan now for the capital plan associated with addressing the present EPA requirements. If we're -- if the extension is really to focus on giving time from a reliability standpoint and from a supply chain management standpoint to ensure that we're doing it in a cost-effective manner and from a reliability standpoint.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When we look at your retail business, what's the net net of kind of losses versus gains?","Nicholas K. Akins","Do we have those kind of numbers, Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. Paul, we can update you. We'll get Bette Jo to get that for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Couple of model-oriented questions and then one strategic one. On the model-oriented one, how should we be -- like is the -- is the impact of POLR that you've seen in the first and second quarter, do you expect a similar run rate for the second half of the year?","Brian X. Tierney","We do, through portions of the third quarter, but then it was shut off during the third quarter. So not a similar run rate for the balance of the year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Other -- O&M, do you expect to realize similar year-over-year O&M cuts in the second half of the year? Or were the O&M cuts you realized this year largely front-end loaded?","Nicholas K. Akins","No. I think we expect to have -- and this just goes back to the discipline. We'll continue to have those kinds of sustainable cuts through the rest of the year. But keep in mind, we sort of plan the year based upon what we think the year is going to turn out to be. And then toward the end of the year, if we wind up with additional ability to do -- move projects up because last year, we moved projects from '12 into '11. We may move projects from '13 into '12 or vice versa. So it really changes based upon how we see the year going. So we expect that to continue. It's a continual process for us, and it shows that discipline around cost side of things.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question, more -- when you think about Ohio and where it fits into the broader kind of spectrum of AEP businesses -- I mean, you guys have over the last few years progressed a ton in terms of getting closer to or actually earning your authorized rates of return. Meaning, you're showing that you're a good team in terms of running and realizing returns out of regulated businesses. You've gone out and bought BlueStar and you're now entering a new competitive business, both on the retail and the wholesale side, and I just want to kind of ask that question. Is that really core to AEP? I mean, is what AEP really good at is from running a regulated business and that as you migrate towards more of a merchant model in Ohio and more competitive model, do  you wonder about whether that's really non-core to what your strengths are and that whether those businesses really fit within the broader bubble of AEP?","Nicholas K. Akins","That's a great question, Michael, because yes, we are thinking about that in terms of the future and certainly, our board has, too. We -- as we think through this process, and it goes back to the February 10 presentation that we did for everyone. It was -- it's really there to say that we are a regulated utility. That's what we do. Now, we're doing the best we can, obviously, with -- we're going to have some unregulated generation. We have -- we still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country. We're going to put that together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business that's viable for the future. Now, the decision will be made later as to whether that makes sense for us or not. But it'll be based upon, as we've said, the February 10 meeting. If we can make it look quasi-regulated, where there's long-term contracts, there's hedging associated with the activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then that -- we'll continue with it. But I think it's important for us to rationalize that process over the next 2 to 3 years and fully understand what that business looks like. The other issue, too, is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next 2 to 3 years in various fundamentals or whether states go to competition or elsewhere. So it really winds up being a very credible option for us in the future. Hopefully, it'll be complementary. But, again, we're very focused on providing regulatory earnings, certainty for our investors. And that's something that we're very focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige from BGC.","Kit Konolige","Couple of follow-ups. So looking towards the August 8 order, can you just remind me, maybe I missed this, but do you expect to get details -- the Commission to provide a detailed roadmap for recovery of the capacity deferrals at that time?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, should be. Because one of the expectations out of the order is to define exactly what that deferral mechanism is. So we'll wind up with that. And certainly as a result of that, we need to understand the cash position as well. And then we'll step forward with the financing and the activities associated with separation of the generation function from AEP Ohio. So we have to have that kind of detail.","Kit Konolige","So it is separate -- so on -- in the August 8 order also, then you expect -- is the separation agreement going to be part of that? And is it going to be clear -- the ability to transfer the couple of large coal plants to the regulated entities?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. We expect the corporate separation order to be done at the same time.","Kit Konolige","Very good. And then -- so one other separate area then -- on the switching outlook, following the capacity order now. Can -- maybe I missed this, all right, but can you give us kind of an updated look forward on now, given where you know you are so far and given what you know about the ability of competitors to charge at RPM rates? What's the outlook for switching, say, for the rest of the year or even the next couple of years?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. I think we should expect to see acceleration of switching as a result. And I'll also believe that the certainty around the ESP order on February 8 will help in that regard. So from a competitive standpoint and knowing what the process is, the market will more fully understand. The other thing, too, is they'll understand what our reaction is because, obviously, we're looking for a decent outcome out of this thing. Otherwise, we have other options that we need to consider. And that can produce lack of clarity for the market. So it's pretty critical that we get this train back on the tracks in a positive fashion.","Operator","That question comes from the line of Raymond -- I'm going to mess it up -- Leung from Goldman Sachs.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Raymond Leung. Nice try. Couple of questions. One, to follow on Michael's about the regulated -- unregulated business. As you guys think about it, what's sort of the right composition mix, Nick, do you think you should have between regulated and unregulated as you sort of think about that business longer-term? And then I have some more -- couple of other housekeeping questions.","Nicholas K. Akins","At the end of the day, it's that percentage where I can get a regulated PE and still have a competitive business that looks regulated. So I think in our February 10, we had 86% regulated and 14% unregulated, including the 4% of our River Operations area. So, as I said, we're a regulated utility, so in my opinion, for our shareholders not to experience the volatility in such a large manner associated with the competitive business, we would want a substantial part of our business enough to where we continue to fall in the integrated regulated utility category.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of BlueStar, what type of margins should we expect? I mean, have you provided any type of range or how we should think about that business in terms of profitability?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","We've not. We anticipate margins in the high single-digits to mid double-digits -- mid-teens.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is that on a percentage or dollar per megawatt hour?","Brian X. Tierney","Dollar per.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then last thing, on terms of your financing plans. I think you indicated about $1 billion up for this year. Can you elaborate on that and maybe some any updated thoughts on how you're going to fund the nonregulated side of your business?","Brian X. Tierney","Sure. Let me start with the first part of that. We have a maturity coming due at APCO here in the near term and we also have some needs for our transmission business. As well as wanting to take advantage of some of these low-term interest rates to fund our business for the long-term. So a combination of those things are what are going to add up to that $1 billion need for the end of the year. And then in terms of the deregulated -- competitive business, we've not talked about how we're going to fund ultimately the competitive Ohio generation, whether or not we're going to do that at the Genco level or the parent level. But we do believe we're going to have some interim financing needs until we get to that long-term solution. And we'll be looking to put those interim needs in place by the end of the year.","Charles E. Zebula","Thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Sherwood. Please go ahead.","Julie Sherwood","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2013 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks, Julie. Happy New Year to everyone and thanks for joining us today. Usually, the new year comes with a sense of renewed optimism that our best days lie ahead. I can tell you, here at AEP, reviewing what has been accomplished during 2013 and after a more detail review of the fundamentals during the fourth quarter, there is reason to be optimistic. The foundation has been set for continued success and perhaps, finally, a growing economy.","We talk a lot here about infrastructure development, including transmission, the customer experience and the employee experience, and this provides the focus for the actions we take.","In that context, I'm very pleased to report several significant accomplishments during 2013. Our safety performance. For the second year in a row, we accomplished 0 fatalities on our entire system with one of the best safety records we've ever had. Moreover, we also had our best year from an environmental stewardship and compliance perspective. We are very proud of both these accomplishments that, in my view, is a strong indicator of the health of the organization.","We completed corporate separation on time and accomplished many of our objectives, including the transfer of the Ohio generation assets to APCo, Kentucky and the new unregulated generation company. I want to thank all of the commissions and the other stakeholders for their cooperation to get this done.","We delivered fourth quarter '13 GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share and operating earnings of $0.60 per share, concluding the year 2013 with GAAP earnings of $3.04 per share and operating earnings of $3.23 per share, solidly in the upper range of guidance.","Rate activity was positive, with $340 million of secured rate changes across our state jurisdictions. I'm pleased to report from last week that PUCT did reverse the AFUDC decision that had previously gone against us, and I'm very thankful they did that, and indicated that we can invest in Texas in a positive fashion.","We completed 2 securitizations, totaling $648 million in APCo in Ohio, with one remaining securitization that's regarding the Ohio fuel. We exceed our performance improvement targets for the year, and our current 2014 initiatives are continuing positively and on schedule.","Our previous dividend increases announced during 2013 improved our dividend payout by 6.4% and continues our focus on maintaining the dividend commensurate with earnings. We continue to target 60% to 70% payout dividend ratio. Our total shareholder return for the year was 14.2%, so a very good year.","Our employees have clearly responded to the challenges that we faced during 2013 and came through with flying colors. Our emphasis on execution, culture and financial and strategic discipline are paying dividends, no pun intended. As an example, the Gavin plant has gone through lean activities and recognized the change in the operating practices, certainly, during this event we had with the polar vortex. So it's just early indication of the successes that we've had relative to the lean activities. I am pleased with the response and energy of our employees as we redefine the culture of AEP and in fact, the future of AEP.","So let's talk about the future, 2014. We are reaffirming our guidance ranges for 2014, '15 and '16 and the 4% to 6% growth rate. 2014 guidance is $3.20 to $3.40 per share. Our continuous improvement initiatives are progressing well with 4 plants done with the lean rollout. Now we're focusing on Cardinal, Mitchell, Rockport and others. We continue the wires lean work in Ohio and APCo, and we'll soon move ahead to I&M and SWEPCO.","Our management team, including myself, participated in the team rollouts, and we expect ITE and the Mitchell rollout coming up soon. And the energy and ingenuity of our employees is just amazing in this process. The new unregulated generation function continues to work to reform its cost structure and operating parameters in the PJM market, and many other activities are progressing as well.","Transmission growth continues on plan, and we continue to focus on even more capital, moving to transmission as we showed you earlier in the EEI presentation late last year. We are pleased with the progress being made in this segment of our business.","We have rate proceedings in Oklahoma, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky during the year. We're planning for 2014 of having rate relief of $175 million and rate recovery, 82% of which is already secured. Chuck Zebula continues his work to optimize the unregulated business to ensure that it's cash positive and contributes to earnings. Of course, cold or hot weather helps, but we continue to work on PJM capacity market reforms to enable investment to occur, as well as a focus on any emerging hedging possibilities and cost-related efficiencies in this business.","Just as an aside, to quickly remark on the capacity markets and recent experience with the polar vortex, it is interesting to note that while daily gas prices are in the $5 to $6 per MBtu range and energy prices are soaring well beyond that, supported by gas price increases alone, it is clearly evident the capacity rents are being reflected in energy prices, indicating a need for further reform of capacity markets.","Looking at the physical side. When 89% of our coal capacity slated for retirement in mid 2015 is called upon and running, natural gas delivery is challenged and voltage and load reductions are occurring is another reminder that we should carefully plan and design this social safety net we call the electric grid to meet extreme requirements, not just steady-state conditions. We believe the nexus of EPA initiatives energy market development and security threats, whether physical or cyber, is a national security issue.","All of this that we've achieved in the last year certainly contributes to the customers' experience by providing electricity in a safe reliable, economical fashion and environmentally respectful way.","Now let's move to my equalizer chart. We've -- that's on Page 5 of the presentation. The overall is approximately 9.9% ROE. This comes down a little bit but primarily reflects rate recovery lag from rate cases and the heavy project spend in transmission. We expect this to improve.","So if you look at the chart in the APCo area, we have the Virginia biannual case, the West Virginia rate case, so we expect that to continue to improve. Ohio Power is coming down because of the customer switching that's occurring. Kentucky, it's in the midst of the Mitchell transition that's occurring. We expect the base rate case to move Mitchell over in the base rates. And then I&M continues to improve at 9.3%. PSO will have a rate case this year. SWEPCO has some transmission-related costs to recover and also, some Dolet Hills related generation cost in Arkansas.","And then, AEP Texas continues to have a significant load growth and amortization of stranded costs is included in that number as well. And then on the TransCo Holdco side, it's 9.5%, but there's obviously rapid rate of investment that's occurring there and the developmental expense related to Transource. And also, CREZ Texas has a TCOS filing that's occurring as well. So we're seeing a continued improvement in there, and we'll continue to address that.","So as we move into 2014, we're watching clearly some very positive indicators from the fourth quarter of 2013 regarding our loan. If you exclude Ormet, the bank rep diluted a manufacturer for the first time and not just several quarters, but several years. In fact, back to 2007, all of our categories, residential, commercial and industrial load increased in the same quarter. That's the first time that's happened in years. We are seeing significant shale gas and other load-related activity improve, so we are optimistic based upon the quarter that this trend could continue. Brian will address this in more detail.","2014 will be a year of significant strategic importance to AEP. Our management and the board will focus much attention on transmission growth, our regulated businesses, the utility model for the future and what that means and we will continue to review the progress in the unregulated business as well.","So since we last talked to you all at EEI late last year, we've made some significant progress in several strategic areas, corporate separation, the transmission allocation of capital, the infrastructure investment, focus on our regulated business, defining the business case for our unregulated business, producing quality dividends and earnings for our shareholders and quality service to our customers, and defining a culture for AEP for the future. In a nutshell, sticking to our knitting, that of a focus regulated business. I'll turn it over to Brian at this point.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, you will see our comparison of 2013 results to 2012 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In the interest of time, I'll focus my remarks on the full year column and only add comments for the quarterly comparison when necessary.","Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $2 -- $296 million or $0.60 per share, up $0.10 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. These results bring the full year earnings to $1.573 billion or $3.23 per share compared to $1.497 billion or $3.09 per share recorded in 2012, an improvement of $0.14 per share.","Stepping through the detail from top to bottom, you can see that the annual comparison was adversely affected by a combination of certain Ohio transition items that were unfavorable by $0.26 per share. This effect on earnings was driven by an increasing customer switching net of the capacity deferrals, lower capacity payments from competitive retail energy suppliers and the overall -- and the reversal of 2012 prior-period unfavorable provisions.","The effective income tax rate was unfavorable at $0.17 per share for the year due to unfavorable year-on-year tax-to-book differences accounted for on a flow-through basis, as well as positive adjustments to the state income tax returns that were recorded in 2012. A significant portion of this effect was recorded during the fourth quarter. Allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, was off $0.10 per share for the year, due primarily to the start-up of the Turk Plant in December of 2012.","O&M expense net of offsets was unfavorable $0.05 per share for the year, primarily due to increased spending for planned outages in 2013. The unfavorable variance for the quarter reflects higher storm and employee-related costs.","On a total system basis, excluding earnings offsets and River Operations, O&M for 2013 was $2.8 billion, which was flat to 2012. As you may recall, we expect to hold O&M at this level in 2014 as well. Off-system sales margins net of sharing for the year were down $0.05 per share. This decline was driven by lower RPM capacity revenues that hurt results by $0.03 per share and lower trading results.","The annual decline in regulated retail load of $0.02 per share is driven by the lower industrial demand across much of our service territories. I will discuss the economy and our retail sales data in more detail in upcoming slides. AEP River Operations began to rebound during the fourth quarter but was still off $0.01 per share for the year. This decline in earnings reflects the lingering impact of the drought of 2012. Weather helped our annual earnings by $0.04 per share versus 2012 and was favorable $0.07 per share versus normal weather.","Favorable interest income contributed $0.07 per share for the year, due primarily to the recognition of the interest income from the resolution of the U.K. windfall tax issue earlier in 2013. Transmission Holdco continues to grow, adding $0.02 per share for the quarter and $0.07 per share for the year, reflecting significant investment in this area. Consistent with our goal to allocate available capital to Transmission, earnings for this segment were $0.16 per share, $0.02 higher than originally forecasted with guidance for 2013. Our guidance for 2014 reflects $0.29 per share of ongoing earnings from this segment.","The quarterly comparison of the parent added $0.11 per share and was due to the make-whole premium for debt retired late in 2012. The annual comparison for the parent shows a benefit of $0.15 per share due to that debt retirement and the resulting lower interest expense realized through 2013.","Rate changes were favorable by $0.11 per share for the fourth quarter. This quarterly result pushes our favorable year-to-date comparison to $0.45 per share. This improvement in earnings reflects constructive regulatory outcomes in multiple jurisdictions. Finally, other items for the annual comparison were favorable by $0.02 per share, primarily driven by lower long-term interest and lower depreciation expenses.","In summary, despite considerable headwinds in Ohio, we were able to deliver results near the upper end of our guidance range. The better-than-expected results were aided some by weather, but more importantly, we executed on our regulatory and strategic plans. In all, 2013 was a successful year for American Electric Power.","Turning to Slide 7. You will see our usual detail in normalized retail load with the new feature. On the bottom half of the slide, you will see a light blue line that adjusts the gross industrial and overall normalized load trends by factoring out the impact of the Ormet load. We felt that this presentation was helpful because although the loss of the Ormet load was significant in terms of volume, AEP did not earn significant margin on that load.","On the bottom right quadrant, you can see that weather-normalized total load was down 0.8% for the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Excluding Ormet, the quarterly number is actually positive 0.9% and was down only 0.6% for the year.","For 2014, we are forecasting total normalized load to be down 1.1%, but the forecast is essentially flat when Ormet is excluded. Industrial load was down 3.2% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Excluding Ormet, quarterly industrial sales were actually up 1.6% and the annual comparison was down only 1.6%. For 2014, we are forecasting gross industrial load to be down 2.2%, but positive 1.2% when adjusted for Ormet.","There were a number of new industrial expansions especially related to the Oil and Gas sector that we expected to come online earlier in 2013, but were delayed until the second half of the year.","Looking forward to 2014, we expect an additional 270 megawatts of new industrial load to come online. This will help to offset the negative drag on industrial growth caused by the loss of Ormet. We will take a closer look at industrial load on the next slide.","Residential sales, shown in the upper left quadrant, were up 0.9% for the quarter, which brings the annual sales flat to 2012. We continue to see modest customer growth in our Western service areas, while our East customer accounts were essentially flat. Average usage per customer has been impacted by home energy efficiency programs. For these reasons, we are expecting normalized residential sales to be down nearly 1% in 2014.","Finally, in the upper right-hand quadrant, you can see the commercial sales were essentially flat for the quarter and the year. Commercial sales saw some growth in Texas, Ohio and Oklahoma, where we have seen stronger employment gains. We are forecasting commercial sales to be roughly flat in 2014.","Let me stop here and provide an update on the economy within AEP's footprint. AEP service territory continues to experience economic growth despite the drag that the federal fiscal austerity measures placed on our economy. Most economists predicted that the third quarter would be most impacted by the sequestration, and this was true for us.","For the fourth quarter, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 1.3%, which is an improvement over the 1.1% growth we saw in the third quarter, but still below the projected fourth quarter growth for the U.S. of 2.3%. Fortunately, employment statistics, which are a better indicator of electricity sales and GDP, were not as weak and remained steady through 2013. Job growth in AEP's Western footprint was up 1.4% and just below the U.S. at 1.7%, while job growth in the East moderated recently to 0.8%.","With that segue, let's turn to Slide 8, where you will see the quarterly and annual results from our 5 largest industrial sectors. Our largest sector, Primary Metals, was down 23% for the quarter and 18% for the year. Earlier, I mentioned the curtail of production of Ormet, and excluding this effect, this sector would have been down closer to 7.7% in 2013. That customer has now fully ceased operations until we expect to see this impact through the third quarter of 2014.","Chemical Manufacturing sales were up nearly 5% for the quarter, bringing the annual decline to 0.3%. We saw a number of customers increase their production towards the end of 2013. As global markets for chemicals continue to recover, we expect this export industry will grow. Petroleum & Coal Products sales were down 2.5% for the quarter and 1.6% for the year. This was mostly due to 3 specific refineries that were down for routine maintenance in 2013. Excluding these 3 customers, sales for this sector were up 2.5% for the year.","The Mining sector, excluding Oil and Gas, was up 0.6% for the quarter, but still down 1.4% for the year. This decline reflects the continued impact of low natural gas prices and weak demand from utilities and metals producers.","Paper Manufacturing was up 7.5% for the quarter and 3.3% for the year, driven by a major expansion in Ohio, along with Ohio -- along with higher demand in our Western footprint. Although not in our top 5 sectors, we continue to see growth in the Oil and Gas Extraction and Pipeline Transportation sectors, driven by continued gains related to shale gas activity.","Slide 9 provides a picture of the financial health of the company. Our total debt-to-capitalization improved in 2013, ending the year at 54.3%. We look back as far as 1999, and 2013 had the lowest percentage of debt-to-capitalization over that timeframe. Other important metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO-to-debt continued to be solidly in the BBB and Baa2 range and 4.7x and 18.8%, respectively. We also ended the year with a strong liquidity position of $3.5 billion, bolstered by our 2 revolving credit lines and our term loan facility.","On the bottom left-hand side of the page, you will see that our qualified pension funding has increased to fully 99%. The company has aggressively funded this plan to the benefit of our employees, retirees, shareholders and bondholders. In addition to the funding, the company has been working hard to match the duration of the assets to the liabilities and to derisk the plan as it approaches full funding.","In addition to our pension results, our other post-employment benefit plan is now more than fully funded at 117%. This is as a result of changes that we made in 2012 to our post-employment medical plans for future retirees. The financial strength depicted on this slide demonstrates the commitment that our board and management have to growing the company and at the same time, maintaining a very strong balance sheet.","Turning to Slide 10. We can review some of our assumptions and sensitivities underpinning our 2014 guidance range of $3.20 per share to $3.40 per share. As you would expect, the key sensitivities, retail sales volumes, which we have already discussed, remember that we base our guidance on normal weather.","While you'll be right to think that load has been strong so far with the extreme January weather, please be cautioned that this is only one month in what should work out to be yet another 12-month year. Our regulated and competitive businesses have different sensitivities to wholesale prices for power at $0.01 and $0.02 per share per dollar for the year, respectively.","And of course, O&M expenses and taxes are also key to earnings, with a 1% change in O&M having a $0.04 per share impact and a 1% change in the effective tax rate having a $0.05 per share impact on earnings. At this point in the year, we do not anticipate much variability in the tax rate for 2014.","A significant driver for 2014 earnings is rate changes of $175 million. As Nick said earlier in his remark, of this amount, the company has already secured 82%. Most of the remaining amount is expected to come from wholesale FERC formula rate customers where annual rate adjustments are fairly routine.","You can see the power and natural gas prices that were used in formulating our guidance. Prices have changed since we developed this guidance last year. But at just 27 days into the new year, it makes a lot of sense to maintain our operating earnings guidance and to keep it steady as she goes.","More than ever, with some of the market challenges we face in 2015 through 2017, we will be actively managing outage schedules and expenses in response to revenue changes in order to keep inside the guidance cone you see on the left-hand side of the next page.","So turning to Slide 11. I want to reiterate a point that Nick made earlier in his remarks. Our 4% to 6% growth rate is predicated on continued investment in our regulated properties and by our continued focus on sustainable cost savings and O&M discipline. The green flags on the right highlight the major initiatives that are underway.","Let me provide some granularity on 2 of the work programs in order to provide insight that this is a serious focus of management and employees as we begin 2014. Management is providing our employees with the tools and processes to advance continuous improvement, and our employees are providing the ingenuity and the know-how to get the job done.","On the generation side, 4 of our larger generating plants have engaged in employee-led sustainable improvement programs beginning in 2013. These plants have already experienced expense savings through more efficient work practices, heat rate improvements and better utilization of the contracted workforce. Similar programs have started at additional plants already in 2014, with 5 more to go during the year. In 2015, 4 additional plants will be engaged.","Our generating plants are leading the rest of the company in continuous improvement initiatives, demonstrating the gains that can be realized through these efforts. Similar programs have been launched by our distribution employees. 2 districts began initiatives in 2013, with 16 scheduled for 2014, 9 in 2015 and 2 in 2016. These districts are using employee-led idea generation, benchmarking and whiteboarding to streamline their processes, better engage our workforce and to focus on customer service and savings.","Our transmission, supply chain, procurement and corporate center organizations are engaged in similar programs, demonstrating that continuous improvement and employee engagement are part of our culture. Our employees are well aware of the opportunities and challenges presented by our changing business environment. They also have the passion and drive to make the most of the opportunities, to meet the challenges and to serve our customers as they expect to be served.","On Wednesday of this week, Nick will lead another employee meeting on these subjects as a way of ensuring that all 18,500 employees are informed, motivated and engaged as we move forward. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you repeat what you said about your -- what was the build-up for your assumptions on residential sales? And then can you extrapolate on what that means sort of going forward over the next several years of your forecast?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. So we're anticipating residential sales to be down almost 1 percentage point in 2014. And we think it's largely being impacted by a lot of the energy efficiency programs that we have across our service territory, with Ohio, Indiana and some other states having some pretty aggressive programs. So it is impacting load, also customer accounts are an impact as well. We're seeing positive customer account growth in the western part of our service territory and pretty stagnant customer growth in the eastern part of our service territory. So when you put those effects together, it's definitely a drag. We'll see how things work out as we go through the year, and we'll obviously be updating you quarter by quarter. But we are anticipating some load decline in the residential sector in 2014.","Nicholas K. Akins","So Greg, the last quarter of the year indicated some positive strength to that. But I think you -- we're going to have to sort of see that play out before we make any changes.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess what I'm asking is, as we think about the guidance ranges for '15 and '16 -- I'm not asking you to give specific drivers across all the factors of the business, but would it be fair to say you're assuming continued reductions in residential demand through time due to federal and state energy efficiency standards? Or do you think that your base case for economic growth beats [ph] into that and you could get back to a positive net residential growth?","Nicholas K. Akins","Our load growth assumptions through '16 are very, very conservative. So I mean, we are not forecasting to hit our numbers. The classic 1% to 2% load growth that we had seen earlier in the century, we're anticipating that negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% load across the timeframe.","Brian X. Tierney","So it's relatively flat. It's less than 0.5%.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Second question is on what you're seeing. I know you have a de minimus footprint in -- relative to a lot of the other companies when it comes to competitive generation and retail, but it's still significant for you. Have you seen behavior change on the part of retail consumers and wholesale buyers in the last several weeks with regard to what they're willing to pay for longer-term power contracts? Wholesale prices are up quite a bit in '14, last 3 weeks, not as much altitude [ph], but are you starting see some depth and breadth of the market come back as volatility comes back or not?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. Greg, we really haven't seen much of that yet. Obviously, there's going to have to be a little history that plays out here with the weather. But also, it's pretty clear that capacity rents are included in energy prices. So with the market reforms that are occurring plus the experiences people are having relative to this extreme weather, there may be opportunities for additional hedging to occur and also, for customers to finally see that we need to sort of lock things up for the long term. So it may be helpful, but at this point, it's too early to tell.","Operator","Next question is from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Nick, just kind of -- now that the transition for competitor generation in Ohio is kind of on its way, can you just share your thoughts on the future of competitive generation in the AEP business mix? And maybe to what Greg was asking, are you're starting to see or are you able to engage in conversations about some long-term supply agreements to help put some more visibility in that business?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think we stand by originally what we said relative to this business that it'll hinge upon our ability to see this additional hedging occur, that we can firm up the supply and make it look quasi-regulated. At this point, because capacity markets have been depressed and now recent experience aside, it's difficult to tell how successful we'll be in our ability to hedge that up because -- but we're not standing on our laurels with that. We're aggressively looking at the cost structure of the business. We're also reforming the way we operate as our plants -- because they know full well their survival is at risk there. And so we're going to do everything we can do to position this fleet to where it's positive and also address the market reforms that are occurring for now. And then, hopefully, with the events that have transpired recently with the weather, it could help us in terms of -- and get additional hedges in place. But that business, our retail operation, together now with that generation fleet, there are some opportunities there, so we're working on all fronts to ensure that we're able to position this business as best we can. And at the end of the day, it needs to look quasi-regulated to us.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, yes, Nick, from a market reform perspective, given the time horizon, even to the next RPM results actually affecting your earnings contribution, are there changes going to happen in a reasonable time period of giving you guys comfort to wait it out? Or are you going to need a customer to come in and buy and -- rather than having policy reform to do it?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, that sort of -- that remains to be seen. We have -- I think there's 2 or 3 of the changes -- market changes that PJM has filed at FERC. We expect another to get filed. And then with the strainer review of the curve itself, there are some opportunities there if it's done in a positive fashion. But we're going to have to see the results actually of what FERC approves. And it's important for us to see that FERC understands the issues that are in play here and that they obviously make wise decisions on what that market reform should be. And certainly, this is its first round of -- the 2 or 3 filings that have been made by PJM will be instructive in terms of what FERC's mood is relative to market reform.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, just one last question, Nick. Just on -- Greg asked about residential load, but commercial also looking pretty flat for '14 versus '13 with sustained GDP growth and that sort of thing. Is there a potential that, that number will start to spruce up, or are you just not seeing kind of the growth construction or commercial space to give you confidence that's coming back?","Nicholas K. Akins","No, I think there's a chance it will. We just -- I think one quarter, a trend doesn't make. So we've got to look at the numbers for this quarter that's occurring now, and we'll continue to adjust accordingly. And not just only adjust our forecast accordingly, but adjust our cost structure accordingly as well, and our employees are well tuned in to that process at this point. So this is very much about optimization business now.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. At EEI, you kind of indicated that your forecast didn't have any project on the transmission side that weren't pretty ironclad. What kind of upside is there from here from what you've done since then?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So as you recall there in EEI, we had the presentation of the real projects that are in the plan right now, and then we had this incremental bandwidth above that graph that showed the incremental real projects that are also in hand that we're finding capital for. As you recall, we -- for 2013, I think we moved $120 million of capital over to transmission as a part of our regular ongoing process, primarily from generation, and that's been positive for us. We'll continue to do that to achieve the capital associated with those particular projects that's still well in hand, moving forward very well. And in fact, now, we're in the process of defining a ridge even above that, but that's going to be -- that's going to have to play itself out in terms of our ability to come up with the real projects. We also -- we aren't standing aside on the sidelines with Transource and other activities. We continue to pursue projects outside of our footprint, as evidenced by the -- I know you probably saw that we were 1 of 5 bidders for a Canadian project in the Murray 500 kV project. So all that's going on in all cylinders. And we're very happy with the progress in there, and we'll continue to identify those real projects that can be done.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just -- you indicated you're not changing your forecast for gas or power pricing. But I assume it's safe to think that so far in the year, it's been a nice tailwind. In other words, you're not having to go buy power in the east-side markets to fulfill some obligations.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, that's right.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. So most of what we have for off systems, that's for -- particularly for the generation resources side of the business is hedged with its contract to Ohio for the year. So although our units are performing well, demand is strong, I wouldn't want to get -- have irrational exuberance over the fact that it's been cold and prices have been high at this point.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But you aren't that long so you are participating?","Brian X. Tierney","What AGR is, and we are participating, but some of our operating companies are having to buy to meet their needs. And we've offered capacity to some of those companies to help fill that need, and some have taken it and some haven't. And we're hoping to get positive resolution to that. But not all of our operating companies are long through this event, but AGR is.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Then lastly, just what your early read on what's going to happen in the next capacity auction? Or is it just too many things still up in the air here to predict that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, I think if the market reforms that FERC has in front of it now, are approved, that could be helpful. Whether it's enough, remains to be seen. And that's something I think that all the generators are looking at in terms of how matured you're going to get around the continued investment in generation for the long-term within PJM. But that remains to be seen. I think some have said a slight uptick. Some have said more than that. But it remains to be seen.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","A good number of my questions have been answered already. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color on, Nick, your equalizer slide, as you always call it.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And just go through it again which is improving and which is deteriorating. And also, could you provide a little detail on the transmission spend and why it's -- why there's a lag there and can that be caught up or is that just going to, the lag, going to stabilize and we'll start to see earnings grow with investment?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, sure. So I'll go through it, in terms of the Ohio Power, the 11.3%, that will probably continue to come down slightly because customer switching continues and as part of the Ohio situation. APCo should improve. There is a West Virginia base case that needs to be filed during the year. And then there is also the Virginia by annual case. As far as Kentucky Power is concerned, that's in sort of a middle of the settlement that occurred relative to the Mitchell transfer. Right now, there is sort of a rider in place. But later in the year, our base rate case will be filed that includes Mitchell being moved over. And then, also, as part of that settlement, also some sales revenues come back to the company, 100%. So that's helpful during the interim process. So we expect that to come up. I&M continues to improve. When you get the full value of the rate, and all the rate activities that they've been involved with. I think the last report had 9.1 or something like that, so up to 9.3, which is positive and will continue to improve. That's where we have the legislation for the nuclear life cycle management projects, the environmental projects. So we have a really, really good recovery mechanism there. And then, PSO is in the midst of a rate case. They just filed it, I think, a week ago, a little over a week ago. $45 million rate case and asking for a 10.5% ROE. That's some smart grid activity involved with that. So we expect the positive result there. And then, as far as SWEPCO is concerned, the only lagging part of SWEPCO we have is the portion of Turk that wasn't included in Arkansas retail rates. And that's being sold on the wholesale market. But there are some increases there related to transmission-related costs filings that need to be made in the jurisdictions. And then there are some dollar deals expense that needs to be filed in Arkansas. So they're working on that as well. So we expect that to improve. And it's moved, it originally, I think, was at 7%, it's up to 7.4%. So it's on its way back up. And then, AEP Texas. It stands pretty good in terms of load growth. It's really helping out there. And that number also includes the amortization of the stranded cost. So it looks high, but it includes that. And then, as far as the Transco, ATT is an area where a TCOS filing has been made. And it still lags. So it will lag until the TCOS filing is made, which that's a pretty standard filing that we've, actually we've already made that. But it's a pretty standard filing works much like a fuel cost recovery mechanism. But we expect that to continue to improve. And then, we've obviously, as we try to -- as we address moving capital over to transmission remember, the capital is moving the transmission and we're spending at a pretty accelerated rate there. So the project spends getting out a little bit ahead of the recovery mechanisms, even though the recovery mechanisms are good. So it's a good place to be, as long as we're meeting our earnings objectives and are able to move our capital around, that's a good place to be. So -- and then, we have some, a little bit of developmental expense there related to Transource facilities group reflected through with the construction going on within Transource. So we expect that to continue to improve as well. So really, probably the only one that could move down is Ohio Power because of the everything associated with the transition to Ohio. But the other's -- the other jurisdictions are on their way up and doing well.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And just one other. To be clear, how much is essentially all of the transmission spend adjudicated by FERC and then passed through the operating companies? Or are there -- is there state-level transmission rate case activity?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, there is some transmission and the operating companies. By and large, most of it is Transco related. It's FERC regulated. And then, of course, Texas is PUCT regulated. So it's pretty straightforward. I mean, we've got the projects. We know what the projects are. They're real projects, and they're just plowing through the process with some favorable recovery mechanisms. So we're particularly happy with where the transmission business is going.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And the final question. Do you have any kind of middle-term, 3-year view on the transmission, earnings contribution and what that's going to mean for where you are in that cone of earnings guidance after 3 years?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So the high case by '15 is $0.39 a share. And which was, I guess, the original modeling we had have $0.36 a share. So additional $0.03 a share. And then, by '16, we're looking at $0.43 a share. And that they could be upwards toward $0.51 a share. So that's -- and that's based upon those real projects, as I said before. Now if we have incremental projects above that, then there could be additional opportunities there, particularly if some of these projects that we have in PJM that are -- that have been proposed, or the Canadian projects or anything else, that will also contribute beyond what we show and what we did show in the graph back at EEI. But that EEI graph is pretty solid. In that matter, it is solid. And that's pretty solid, it is solid. The issue for us here is making sure we replow the capital back in to get that top side of the transmission, and then also, identify anything beyond that.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And so, just to be clear, if you were to hit the top side of transmission, say, in '15 to $0.39, would that -- would that mean you come in at the top side of that consolidated EPS range?","Nicholas K. Akins","We continue to hold onto our 4% to 6%. Based upon that original guidance in '13 we gave, that had a 3 15 mid-point. It's a broad bandwidth. And certainly, there's a lot of things that could happen, and ins and outs in the process. So it's sort of difficult to tell at this point. But we'll certainly let you know as it gets closer.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit more about transmission. Nick, you had laid out on one of there earlier slides about a 9.5% Transco earned ROE for the year, but there are a number of sort of near-term impacts to that. Wondering if you could just flush that out a little bit more and then talk about, going forward. And then I'll shift to a bigger picture question.","Nicholas K. Akins","So as far as the transmission is concerned, the TCOS filing is already made. So I think they have a 6 months, is it, to come up with a solution there, I think. And it's sort of -- it's -- actually, we've been very successful with our TCOS filing. So I wouldn't suspect we would have any issues there. And then, really, the return, the ROE of 9.5% doesn't reflect the authorized return at all. We're just getting out ahead and we're intentionally getting out ahead to make sure that we plow as much capital as we can into transmission.","Brian X. Tierney","And Stephen, you also remember that our authorized ROE in PJM is 11.49% and in SPP, it's 11.2%. And with the formula rates that we have for those Transcos, they get updated on an annual basis. So the longest lag we have is 365 days and the average is 180. But we're piling so much money into that business right now that there is some lag, and that's being reflected in the 9.5% combined ROE.","Nicholas K. Akins","So again, when you look at it, we're not too concerned about the numbers, I mean, actually, we're not very concerned at all at this point, the 9.5% because the authorized is there, the recovery mechanism is there, the real projects are there. So we just keep plowing away. And I think we're benefiting from the years that we started this transmission business. And we're reaching the critical mass in our own type of investments. And we feel very good about what we're spending, how we're spending it, and certainly, the recovery mechanisms that are in play. So you'll see -- I mean, I guess, last since last year we've been saying we're going to plow as much capital as we can in the transmission. And when you get out ahead of the recovery mechanisms in transmission, you're doing a lot. And -- but we're happy with the progress.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Nick, your last comment goes to my broader sort of question, when I think about execution risks or transmission. At EEI, you laid out the categories of projects, and many of those looked, honestly to me, as relatively low risk projects. But at a high level, can you talk about execution risk to get to that higher case? What are the key things on your mind when you think about that?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think there's minimal execution risk. These are actual projects that are on the same thing. We're not gold plating anything. We're focused on refurbishing the grid and enhancing the grid to respond to retirements, generation retirements. RTO-related projects. All those kind of things that are in that plan. And there's a minimal execution risk. As long as we perform well, stay on budget, stay with the projects that we've got and ensure that we're -- we've got the right message in terms of optimization, and the activities we do in transmission are needed. And that's something -- what you're seeing in that list is really needed projects for reliability, not economic projects. Those are additive, if they ever occur. So -- and the other positive benefit is that once again, the diversity of all our states is a positive because we're investing, not only in our states, but the adjacent states. And we've added Kansas and Missouri to Transource. So we have some distinct opportunities in all those jurisdictions and the adjacent areas to really have some tremendous benefits here. And really, ultimately, tremendous benefits for our customers and as well, the optimization of the grid itself.","Operator","And we'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just wanted to first touch base on this capacity market rent that you're seeing in the Energy markets. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? I mean, where do you see it going forward with respect to this? And I know it's cold out there and what have you, but it would serve an unusually high prices, it seemed, in some jurisdictions, some zones and what have you. And I'm just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more as to what you think is actually going on there in the long-term outlook.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think you're right. I think we're seeing higher energy prices earlier than what we thought. We really thought that it really take off when the units that we are running with retirement. We're retiring 7,150 megawatts of coal fire generation, and 89% of that is running now. And if you start to see which we're seeing and economies start to improve, and on the heels, you're trying to retire that generation, you -- I mean, certainly, we expect that energy prices to continue to improve. But this shows to me, it's shows where the real world and the play world collides. And it reflects through in the energy prices. And if the capacity market is not well thought out in terms of enabling investors to invest and advance relative to construction and everything else associated with the grid itself, then you wind up having this kind of thing happened.","Brian X. Tierney","Hey, Paul, we've been paying in our market area for gas in the PJM part of our footprint, around $6 in MMBtu for gas. You're seeing PJM prices that are $1,000 a megawatt hour during emergencies, going up to $,1,800 a megawatt hour. Do you think that people being paid those prices are being paid for energy? They're not? PJM is basically paying people for the value of their capacity to keep the lights on. It's not energy that they're being paid for, it's capacity. We need to getting some of those capacity rents back in the capacity auction because PJM is showing the real value of having that capacity when they're willing to pay someone $,1,800 when the price of gas is $6 in MMBtu.","Nicholas K. Akins","I think if, I remember back in 1984, I was in system operations, and the same thing happened, where you had a very cold winter, caps gets frozen. instrumentation gets frozen, natural gas isn't available and it winds up being an energy prices goes out the roof. And then every one of your coal units and every other resource that you have is brought on the run. And you also have, with cold weather, obviously, coal piles can get frozen. But we haven't run into too much of that. We've been successful in getting through this process. But I think it shows the value of a balanced portfolio. And when that portfolio is no longer balanced, you're going to have additional risks that are placed upon the grid that we really do need to think about. And you brought up a great question that I guess we can talk about all day. But it's clearly a message that I think everyone needs to really focus on the future of the grid and what it actually means to service for our customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I didn't want to take a full day on it because I think you're right. We probably could. But interesting topic. Just back on transmission for a second. I mean, you mentioned that none of this stuff is economic. But do we -- should we expect really no impact on re-rating of the lines, and the improvement on the actual transmission lines in terms of deliverability across regions of LBA as a result of [indiscernible] ?","Nicholas K. Akins","No, no, we're improving the deliverability. We're expanding the ratings of lines. We are putting in additional transformers. We're putting in additional substations. And a substation, I mean, we're building a substation that cost $250 million. So these aren't small investments that are being made, but they're investments to reinforce and increase the capabilities of the grid itself. and then as well with the generation retirements. There's a lot of planning around additional transmission resources to support those retirements as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. But I mean, should we think it perhaps there being an improvement in terms of transmission between LBAs at all? Or I mean, in terms of the actual change in the of, I guess, the ability of power to go places where, more power to go into certain areas?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, you'll see it from a reliability perspective. From an economic perspective, it just takes longer to do. Because, I mean, if we cross multi states then you get involved with with cost allocation and the issues between RTOs, and that could be sort of a limiting factor until all of this gets fully rationalized. But ultimately, with the retirements, with the changes in the way the system is being used, it is clear that transmission investment will be a continued positive, at least through the next decade.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the why a first refusal in order of 1,000. Is there any risk that third parties might compete for this transmission CapEx?","Nicholas K. Akins","Oh, yes. But a lot of it, a lot of the transmission that we're doing is our transmission project. So when you get into the competitive projects, that's where order 1,000 comes into play. And we think we're well-positioned to compete in that environment because we've been doing it for a while. And so, not only do we have our own projects that are providing the top line for that critical mass, but we also have those other projects that we're competitively bidding that now we're seeing success in.","Brian X. Tierney","Hey, Paul, what you see in our forecast for transmission spent in earnings, is not subject to Rover. Those are projects that we control, that we have the ability to invest in that are not going to be taken from us by someone else competing for it.","Nicholas K. Akins","And that included those incremental projects that we showed on top as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just, I think Brian mentioned, in his remarks, that prices are a lot higher in near-term than was in your plan, but that you'll be kind of over this multi year period actively managing outages and expenses to kind of stay within that range, roughly. Could you just maybe elaborate? I read that as kind of as you're having a really good period, you'll use that to invest more to benefit kind of the future periods. Is that...","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, you're right.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, Steve, obviously, as we're working our way into '15, '16 and '17, and you and others have identified some of the shortfall that we have associated with the transition in Ohio, and then the RPM pricing that we're facing, we're going to be doing things, like moving outages around during that time period, maybe pulling some forward, if we find ourselves a bit hot on earnings in an earlier period, maybe pushing them out into the '17, '18 timeframe. And we're really going to be managing our way through this to a very high degree as we work our way through to make sure we stay in that cone that we've identified. So if we come in -- if we see things particularly hot, whether it's weather or pricing, in 2014, we might pull some outages or expenses out of '15, '16 into '14' to help us manage our way through that process. So I think your description of it makes me think that you understand very well what we're doing.","Nicholas K. Akins","And that's a process that we've put in place here that I think is working just extremely well. It not only gets capital to transmission, but it also enables us to move projects from one year to another into the year. And that's really a positive process for us that we put in place. It's worked very well. We continue to look at it. We look at numbers on a pretty regular basis to ensure that we're managing the year in the proper fashion. We'll continue to do that. Because, as you all have pointed out, this '14, '15, '16 years are critical for us, particularly '16, because of the capacity markets. But we're managing to it. And so far, we're doing very well.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And just, in 2014, what is your specific savings in pension and OPEBs? I know that's within your O&M budget. But just that specific line, what are the savings versus '13?","Brian X. Tierney","So let me give you some detail on that. '13, and you talked about 2 different things, Steve, we'll talk about the pension costs and then the pension expense, okay. So the cost for '13 was $114 million, and the expense ended up coming in being about $64 million, okay, the O&M expense. And then we're forecasting for '14 the cost to be about $84 million. And we're anticipating that the expense will be about $52 million. So the difference year-on-year, the $64 million to the $31 million, is about $33 million.","Operator","And we'll go to Brian Chin with Bank of America.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just given the recent weather, and a little bit of how the current situation is unfolding. Can you give us some color on cold days of inventory on hand? And does this prompt you to think that there might be some changes to how you head into the contract of season for cold later this year?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, typically, we pull down inventories during the winter months. And we've been on the order of 30 to 35 days on average for just about the whole year. I think it was at the top, it was around 40 days. And it's down to 30, 35 days, and we're fine with that. And we'll be very sensitive about how much additional coal procurement we do as a result. We have a pretty flexible system. And some -- well, and all of our contracts are pretty flexible. So we feel pretty good about where we're at now. I don't think -- we don't have any changing conditions or requirements that we're placing on our coal buying efforts because of the weather. We're just performing as we thought we would.","Brian X. Tierney","We've got more cold than the country has cold right now. We're good to go.","Operator","And our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have a question on, Nick, save the slide, the equalizer slide. And just 2 part. Where do you think the ROEs could go or where do you think is the normalized level of ROE? And what type of sensitivity could you give us, say, for every 50 basis point change in this regulated operation ROE. We could see the $0.10 improvement in earnings or something?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So I think we look at the equalizer chart I like for it to be with the 10 handle on it. And certainly, we'll -- we said long-term. And we're looking around 10.2, 10.3, in that range. And you're seeing in sort of a quarterly perturbation of a lot of activity that's coming into play here. So as long as it just stays in that range, we're in good shape. And Brian, you got anything you want to add.","Brian X. Tierney","I don't, Anthony. We could get you some type of sensitivity for across the system what the 50 basis point change in overall ROE would be, we can get that for you.","Operator","And we'll go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Quickly on rate. So 2014, you had the EEI of 1 97 penciled in, now it's 1 75. Is that change any things that came in lower or lower assumption on the things you haven't yet got?","Brian X. Tierney","'13 came in a little bit higher. The difference is a little bit lower.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's basically the '13 starting point?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, just coming back to this demand question and in the context some of your comments about sort of managing within the curve. I mean, you did take down the residential forecast to this year by, I think, 80 basis points and commercial by 90 in what's, less than 3 months. So are you genuinely seeing that much more concern versus what you're seeing in November? Or is this a little kind of conservatism to offset other stuff?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, so you asked us 2 different questions with the same answer. The answer for your prior question is the same as this one. '13 came in a little bit higher.","Operator","We'll move to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, 2 questions unrelated. First, on the transmission side. We've seen in the MISO and in New England dockets where interveners are seeking lower transmission base ROEs. If same things happens in some of -- whether it's the Southwest Power Pool, whether it's in PJM, how -- what do you think that tipping point is where we change or, I don't know, you're incentive or your desire to be a sizable investor in transmission in the U.S.?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think, as long as transmission is, at a premium or equal to the state rates, we're in good shape. And I think, clearly, there is an incentive being placed on building transmission. We're happy with that. And if -- really, once again, the FERC needs to send some messages here that from a policy perspective that we want to continue building transmission in this country. And as long as that premium is at or above the state rates, then we're in good shape.","Brian X. Tierney","FERC was clearly, Michael, looking to attract a capital into this space. And what they've done with their ROEs has done exactly what FERC wanted to happen. So as long as they, as Nick was saying, as long as they continue to send a signal that they want increased investment in this area, we'll respond to that signal.","Nicholas K. Akins","Okay, I think it's good -- I think, it continues to be part and parcel to the overall grid expansion that's going on in the resilience of the grid. And there's going to continue to be spin regardless. The question is, do you really want to satisfy that precursor of transmission being build out to respond to the generation retirements and so forth to optimize the grid so that you can do that as a prerequisite and then focus on the rest of the underlying system. That's what key. I think you got to get through this transitional process we're at in this industry. So transmission needs to be incentivized in that regard because that will provide the greatest benefit in terms of resiliency of the grid, but also in terms of the optimization of the resources that are attached to the grid.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just looking at your non-transmission investments. So the jurisdictions where you have -- distribution and\/or generation right base. Where do you see the greatest year-over-year changes in capital spending? Where do you see kind of a slowing of capital spending?","Brian X. Tierney","Incrementally more, Michael, in the OPCo T investments across our system is where we're seeing significantly more investment. We're also seeing increased investment in our Cook Nuclear Power Plant and associated with some of the environmental investments that we're having to make to be responsive demands by 2015. So those are general areas where we're seeing incremental investment.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I think we're $3.5 billion to $4 billion on the environmental spend now over the period. And then, when you look at the other capital that we're spending, it's block and tackle spending that typically is recovered from a regulated standpoint. So we're sort of in a position where we're not having to build a large central station generation, but we are able to focus on Transmission and Distribution investments that are clearly beneficial to customers. And customers actually see, and that's a positive.","Operator","And we'll go to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question is on Page 11. It appears there that probably, half or more of your expected pretax earnings improvement by 2016 will be driven by generation and perhaps, a quarter or less by distribution. When I think of the Generation segment, that's obviously one that's transitioning the combination in environments of $60 per megawatt day capacity prices. Distribution, on the other hand, is probably, I would imagine, half of your rate base, half of your O&M. A lot of that at utilities that are under earning. Why -- I'm wondering if you can give me some color on the SKU of these earnings improvements towards generation and relatively strong contribution from Distribution?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think it\u2019s just a matter that your generation typically has to the big ticket items that can be adjusted. And when you look at consumables for a scrubber, the way that all of the parasitic load operates within the plant. Certainly, the way that you contract for the activity is associated with it, particularly in terms of use of contractors versus use of employees, all those types of things are substantial within the generation framework. And there, again, generation sort of functions each plant, functions as its own profit center. And so, doing that, it can focus more readily on the benefits associated with optimization of how they operate. And from a distribution standpoint, it really is a matter of outage scheduling, management with the customers, the processes that are in place that goes back through the organization. So it's probably, at least in our view, when you reach from the customer side of things, you want the distribution side to be very robust in terms of the way that it operates to provide the customer experience that we're asking for. From a generation side, that's all done sort of as a back-office function and it contributes heavily to the benefits from an OEM perspective, but also from a capital perspective. And that's our expectation as we get through this. Nuclear, that process hasn't been through lean activities. They start the lean activities. obviously, we're very careful because Nuclear is different. But it's a heavy capital and OEM spend. And there are opportunities for optimization there as well. So I think we've got the right balance when you look at generation. And then when you look at Transmission and Distribution together, you're -- we're on par.","Operator","And to the presenters, we have no further questions in queue.","Brian X. Tierney","Okay.

Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's second quarter 2018 earnings call. We just completed a very healthy second quarter financially primarily due to weather that continued strong economy in the regions of the country that we serve and further resolution of rate making activities. And, of course, while not complete yet, further approvals occurring \u2013 have occurred regarding Wind Catcher that I'll cover later.","The weather has been a significant story for the quarter. In a nutshell, second quarter was bipolar with no spring. As further proof that we did not have a spring this year, get this, it's almost like a brainteaser, the second quarter 2018 was the fourth coldest second quarter and the second warmest second quarter in the AEP system in nearly 50 years, because winter went well into April and summer came early in May. So, we benefited from that from both angles. Additionally, regarding the economy in the service territory, the AEP service territory economy and load performance continues to be as strong as it has been in years. Brian will be covering the weather and economic information in more detail later.","With that said, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year of $3.75 per share to $3.95 per share and our 5% to 7% growth rate, and as we have said previously, this base plan does not include Wind Catcher.","We are also today giving our first signal of 2021 capital budgets assuming no Wind Catcher to reinforce that our investment thesis as a foundational benchmark is and has been our continued guidance that reflects a long-term 5% to 7% growth rate.","Getting to the financials for the quarter, we had strong earnings for the second quarter 2018 with a $1.07 per share GAAP and a $1.01 per share operating versus $0.76 a share GAAP and $0.75 a share operating, respectively, in 2017. So, overall, a great quarter. This brings year-to-date earnings on a GAAP and operating basis to $2 per share and $1.97 per share respectively versus year-to-date 2017 earnings of $1.97 GAAP and $1.72 per share operating. So, overall, a strong quarter and a strong year so far.","Concerning the regulatory update, I'm sure many on this call want to hear about our thoughts on Wind Catcher. First, I am pleased with the Arkansas, Louisiana and FERC approvals we have achieved thus far. The focus now is almost entirely on Texas and Oklahoma to complete the regulatory approvals necessary to continue towards financing and construction.","We heard both commissions register their concerns about appropriate customer protection related issues, landowner considerations in Oklahoma, needed time to review to \u2013 and render thoughtful decisions, and employment-related information benefiting each state. Most of these issues were also considered in the other state jurisdictions as well and these values were recognized in the various state approvals as well as settlements with the parties.","AEP, PSO and SWEPCO, from the very beginning, have worked extensively to evaluate the risks of the project to our shareholders and our customers to deliver the important benefits of lower customer bills, valuable hedges on future energy process, and diversity of supply, while achieving substantial economic benefits to the states involved with this project.","Chair Walker and the other commissioners in Texas asked us to review our customer protections in relation to other outcomes in a previous case involving Xcel SPS and had questions regarding employment from a Texas perspective supporting the project. We responded with a letter detailing side-by-side comparisons of not only the customer protection mechanisms with the previous SPS order, but also the additional hold harmless provision items that are guaranteed from the Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma settlement and outcomes.","As any other state jurisdictions, we discussed the substantial employment and economic development benefits of this project as well. These provisions go well beyond any assurances provided for other types of generation such as natural gas. Additionally, our letter indicated that in response to concerns in Oklahoma and Texas regarding the timing required to review the case by the commissioners, we negotiated with our supplier partners a further four-week time delay until the end of August to accommodate further consideration. The letter indicates our position on the deal parameters in response to commission concerns as well as indications of the necessary timing for a decision.","I just want to be clear, this letter is meant to be supportive and responsive to commission concerns, but it is necessary because we at AEP are bound by externalities that we have limited or no control to drive the need for a decision to move forward, namely, time to construct the project, to deal with right of way land owners in as flexible fashion as possible to minimize potential condemnations, and to obtain full value of the PTCs to meet our customer guarantees and produce substantial benefits to our customers. This project started with a degree of excitement, primarily driven by our view from a strategic sense of what we can do to minimize what we call percentage of pocket book impacting our customers.","We recognize that if we can spend capital to reduce customers' bills, it's a win-win that will not only define the utility of the future but ensure that we remain relevant to our customers. We are not bound by the coal lobby, the natural gas lobby or the renewables lobby. We are committed to a diverse energy portfolio that provides inherent risk management benefits to our customers. And in the case of Oklahoma, as the State of Texas has done with the CRES build out, the importance of this project is to ensure that all resources, including natural gas and renewables, indigenous to the state can produce diversity of supply and economic development benefits for the states that we are proud to serve. We have another hearing before the Texas Commission tomorrow and we stand ready to answer any questions that the commissioners may have and Oklahoma is contemplating its order as we speak.","AEP believes, through multiple negotiations and commission feedback received in these states, we have struck a balance between our shareholder, our customer and the state interest impacted by this important project. And we look forward to an ultimate resolution by the end of August. Because football season is on us, I'm using a football analogy. We're deep in the red zone with time running out, third down with two plays to go, needing a touchdown with both plays already called, they're called Texas and Oklahoma. Get your beer and chicken wings for an exciting month ahead.","From a shareholder perspective, there have been questions regarding the time limit for a decision and the risk that the company is willing to take on the Wind Catcher project. Certainly, there are parameters that can be dealt with around the edges, but the deal structure and timing are embodied in the letter to Chair Walker and was also sent to the Oklahoma Commission. We need some consistency in the approach and communications to both of these commissions to bring the decision making to a common view. We will certainly live with the outcome that emerges from both the Oklahoma and Texas commissions and we will know, we gave it our best shot with this very unique and ingenious project regardless of outcome. Certainly, we would like Wind Catcher to be approved and move forward, but to reiterate, the foundation of this company remains solid and our growth plans continue to support a 5% to 7% growth rate trajectory regardless.","Our investors can count on the constant earnings and dividend growth that they have come to expect from a premium regulated utility. Brian will introduce our 2021 capital plan that further demonstrates our commitment to this growth rate. We at AEP, nor others, can predict what these two commissions will do to answer the question of whether AEP can move forward with Wind Catcher. But we'll know soon, we'll know soon by the end of August. And as Bob Dylan said, the answer my friend is blowing in the wind.","Now, let's move to the equalizer chart. So, as we go through the various states, overall, our regulated operations ROE is approximately 10% versus 9.5% last quarter. Overall, we generally project the ROE to be around that 10% range, given our geographic diversity. Some companies will be up, some will be down, but as we demonstrated by our historical performance, we are generally in that 9.5% to 10% range. Furthermore, as we noted on the slides, we certainly have five states, five rate cases that we recently completed and one in process which will help some of the underperforming companies.","So, I guess, as we go through these individual companies, looking at AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter 2018 was 13.8%. Keep in mind that includes some legacy items that are included from previous activities associated with the deregulation that occurred before, those roll out now primarily by the end of the year with a small portion going into next year. So, we show this, the 13.8% overall, with those legacy items, but the actual return on equity is 12.1% for Ohio.","Moving to APCo, the APCo ROE at the end of 2018 was 9.7% and APCo's improvement is primarily due to weather. West Virginia is earning in the high 7% range and that's why we have a rate case that's been filed for a rate increase of $115 million with rates effective in March of 2019 in that state. Of course, Virginia is still \u2013 we have established tri-annual rate reviews, AEP's first review for APCo Virginia will be in 2020 and it will cover the 2017-2019 timeframe.","Moving to Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky at the end of the second quarter 2018 was 8.7%. Their rate case is complete, helping drive the turnaround along with better than normal weather conditions for the first half of the year. We expect to earn near the authorized return by the end of the year in Kentucky and, of course, their continued long-term strategic plan is around economic development in that region and certainly our president there has had a lot of success in moving that process forward. So, we expect big things there.","I&M achieved their ROE of 11.9% at the end of the second quarter 2018. I&M had a positive start to 2018, primarily driven by strong sales in all segments, favorable weather, disciplined OEM spending, and favorable one-time true-ups associated with regulatory items. So, I&M continues to spend capital, of course, at nuclear station and in distribution and transmission. So \u2013 and certainly their base rates went into effect in both the Michigan and Indiana jurisdictions as a result of the last rate cases.","PSO, the ROE for PSO at the end of the second quarter was 6.5%. PSOs earned ROE has been slightly boosted by positive weather, but we still are challenged based on regulatory lag in that state. So, we'll be following another rate case in Oklahoma in the third quarter of 2018 to help address this regulatory lag and other matters.","As far as SWEPCO is concerned, the ROE of SWEPCO at the end of the second quarter was 6.8%. The primary reason for the increase is improved weather over the last year. Results also reflect a full quarter of rate relief implemented late last year, last year in May in our Louisiana and Texas jurisdictions. And of course, the ROE continues to be burdened by the overall \u2013 by the Arkansas \u2013 what was the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, the 88 megawatts in Turk, and we continue to look for a home for that.","AEP Texas, the ROE there is \u2013 for the second quarter, was 9.5%. While earnings have grown year-over-year, the reason for the declining ROE is due to timing of annual T cost filings as we continue to make significant transmission investments along with some timing related to O&M spend. So, still a very good opportunity there in AEP Texas.","AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE there is at 11.2%. It's lower than first quarter ROE as a result of the 12-month rolling income calculation. So, the second quarter 2018 had a smaller true-up reflecting the new forward formula rates that are now in the process of being implemented.","So, that's the \u2013 overall, things are going pretty well from a ROE perspective. We continue to work on and seen the results of the five rate cases that we had filed last year and, of course, we have one going on now and one pending. So, we'll continue with that approach to ensure that we continue to manage around that 10%. So, second quarter and year-to-date have moved along positively, and the third quarter will be definitive for Wind Catcher. AEP will continue with a firm foundation that provides excellent value for our shareholders and our customers.","So, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and provide detail on our 2021 base case capital expenditures and equity needs.","Let's begin on slide 6 which shows that operating earnings for the second quarter were $1.01 per share or $498 million compared to $0.75 per share or $370 million in 2017. Most of this year-over-year growth came from weather and the recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers.","Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.56 per share, up $0.31. Weather was a large driver in this quarter with most of the $0.12 increase driven by warmer than normal temperatures in the late spring. Rate changes were also favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions and formula rate true-ups. The box for this segment was other smaller impacts. The Transmission & Distribution Utility segment earned $0.23 per share comparable to last year. As anticipated, AEP Transmission Holdco segment was unfavorable to the second quarter last year due to the minimal formula rate true up this year compared to the larger one in the second quarter of 2017. This was expected due to the change in methodology to fully forward-looking test years. This impact was partially offset by increased investment which has grown by $1.7 billion since last June. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.05 per share, up $0.01 from last year, and Corporate and Other was down $0.01 due to higher interest.","Let's turn to slide 7 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $972 million, compared to $1.72 per share or $845 million in 2017. Our regulated segments experienced growth for the year and, as expected, our competitive Generation & Marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales.","Let's look at the earnings drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.03 per share, up $0.34 with the single largest driver being weather which added $0.24. Successful implementation of rate changes added another $0.14. Other favorable items included higher transmission revenues and normalized load. Offsetting these drivers were anticipated in decreases in our wholesale load as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses. Through June, the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.49 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes, normalized load and weather, which were partially offset by higher depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.42 per share, up $0.01 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base and small non-recurring items which were mostly offset by the larger prior year formula rate true-up. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.13 per share, down $0.05 from last year, again, mostly due to the sale of the assets. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.07 per share from last year due to higher interest and tax expenses and a prior-year investment gain. Overall, we are pleased with our results and confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance.","Now, let's turn to slide 8 for an update on normalized load growth. The load story has been positive through the first half of 2018. Starting in the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 2% for the quarter and were up 1.7% year-to-date, both of which are above expectations for the year. In both comparisons, we experienced normalized load growth across all three retail classes.","Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 3% for the quarter and grew by 2.8% compared to the first half of last year. Industrial sales have been strong for over a year now with growth spread across most industries and operating companies. The sectors that posted the strongest growth in this quarter were all energy-related which is consistent with rising oil prices.","In the upper-left chart normalized residential sales were up 2.1% for the quarter and 1.7% for the year. The chart shows consistent improvement in residential sales over the past year. Once again, growth was spread across nearly every operating company. Through June, customer accounts were up 0.5% compared to last year which is the strongest we've experienced since 2015. Weather-normalized usage was also up 1.7% this quarter and 1.2% year-to-date which correlates with the recent improvement in household incomes, which I'll discuss in more detail in the next slide.","Finally, in the upper-right chart, commercial sales increased 0.7% in the second quarter and increased 0.6% through June. The growth in commercial sales was not as strong in other classes, but still positive.","Now, let's move on to slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U.S. by 0.10% for the second quarter. In fact, the economy in AEP service territory has been growing at a faster pace than the U.S. since the second quarter of 2017. The upper right chart shows the gap in unemployment growth is narrowing between AEP service territory and the U.S. While U.S. job growth has been stable over the past year, AEP's job growth has continued to improve. For the quarter, job growth in AEP's territory was 1.1% with higher growth in our western territory. Another key indicator for measuring the health of the labor market is the unemployment rate. While the U.S. unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since the early 2000s, unemployment in AEP service territory is currently at its record low and is expected to fall further.","One key driver of the tightening labor market has been changing demographics. As more baby boomers retire, businesses are looking to fill those positions from the available labor force. In some industries, businesses are struggling to find qualified labor. As the competition for labor has increased, wages have finally started to rise. The bottom chart on this page shows growth in personal income. Through the first half of 2018, income growth within AEP service territory has exceeded the U.S. For the quarter, AEP customer incomes were 4.6% higher than last year. The increase of income is a key driver for the higher residential usage this year. Overall, higher energy prices and incomes and a relatively healthy global economy have combined to create a positive environment for sales through the first half of 2018. However, tightening labor markets, higher inflation and escalating trade tensions are items with potential headwinds for the second half.","Now, let's turn to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased 0.2% during the quarter to 56.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 19.3% and our net liquidity stood at about $1.4 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our Qualified Pension Funding improved to 103% and our OPEB funding improved to 134%. For both plans, the funded status improved due to rising interest rates, driving a decrease in liabilities that more than offset asset losses.","Now, let's turn to slide 11 and review some detail about 2021 CapEx and capital needs. As Nick mentioned and as we've talked about before, AEP has a solid organic growth plan that supports our 5% to 7% growth rate. In particular, we have robust Transmission & Distribution capital expenditure opportunities for the foreseeable future, exclusive of Wind Catcher. To demonstrate this confidence, we are introducing our 2021 plan, which includes $6.3 billion of capital expenditures, of which, 100% is allocated to our regulated businesses in contracted renewables and 75% is allocated to wires.","In the appendix of our presentation on page 34, we show the pinwheel detail for where the capital will be spent. Similar to 2020, an incremental $400 million of equity above our DRIP (23:11) is required to support that spend and maintain our capital metrics.","Let's try and wrap this up on slide 12, so we can get to your questions. We will obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution for customers regarding tax reform. Our base plan is robust and supports our 5% to 7% growth rate even before the addition of Wind Catcher. Our year-to-date performance and the stability of our regulated business model give us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch",": Hi. Good morning. This is Claire (24:13) for Julien.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hello, Claire (24:14).","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch",": Hey, good morning. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is recognizing that you guys will continue to work on regulatory approvals for Wind Catcher. Can you give a little more color for what other configuration or what other projects you could replace it with that would still take advantage of the one PTC (24:34) and the other PPA contracting structures as well. Just curious about any options there? Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, Claire (24:43), we continue to look at other opportunities where we have the renewables projects in Ohio, for example. We obviously continue that process. There will be other opportunities, but tax reform is certainly \u2013 has certainly changed some of the economics of some of these projects, particularly with lower capacity factors. So, we'll continue to look for opportunities to replace it.","But remember, Wind Catcher was incremental to our base plan. So \u2013 and our base plan obviously supports the 5% to 7% growth rate in the investment in transmission and other areas in our regulated companies. So, with Wind Catcher, obviously, we'll continue to look at not only options. If Wind Catcher were not to happen, there'll still be opportunities for those kinds of resources to be applied through our resource plans in those particular states, so \u2013 but obviously, don't want to miss the opportunity for Wind Catcher because it's a great way to deal with the resource plans in all of those states at one time rather than independently with perhaps less efficient projects. So, we'll continue to take a look at it.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's really helpful.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And my second question is \u2013 this is a little early, I think. For your CapEx update, can you give a little more color as to why you're doing it before November and potentially any color around more than just the 75% of wires, how you're increasing above your 2020 run rate?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, let me answer the first one, Claire (26:29). We keep getting questions about how solid our go-forward plan is and what's the ability to keep investing it organically in our own businesses and we wanted to provide some clarity to that to show that we have plenty of runway to invest organically in our own system, primarily in the wires side of the business with some regulated and contracted renewables as well. So, people are asking, how long can you keep doing that for? And we wanted to provide some clarity. It's out there and we have plenty of runway to keep doing that and felt that the disclosure at this time might be helpful to people as they think about our stock.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","There seem to be some confusion about whether Wind Catcher was required for us to continue with our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. The answer to that is no, it's not required to do that. Our base plan is built around 5% to 7% and Wind Catcher was incremental. We just wanted to make sure that that was abundantly clear and that people weren't looking across the cliff and expecting something different regardless of the outcome. Now, if we get it, that's great. But if we don't, well, okay, we'll move forward with our plan.","Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. I will drop out of the queue. Thanks so much.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from Ali Agha. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. Good morning. First up, on Wind Catcher, Nick, to be clear, if either Texas or Oklahoma does not approve, can the project still go forward or do you need both of those approvals for this project to happen?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. My going-in assumption is we need both of those approvals, because these are regulated jurisdictions and that's where the needs are. And so, our \u2013 certainly, our strong preferences for that project is sized based upon the wind farm that's in existence with the transmission line and to do something different than that would be suboptimal so, we're really focused on making sure that all of the jurisdictions approve it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, secondly, we've seen it now a few times. The sort of, what I would call, the drop dead date keeps getting shifted back. Now, you're telling us its end of August. So, in reality, when you look at the physical aspect of having it all built by the end of 2020, when exactly do you need to have this started? And, I guess, related to that, I'm sure you've been observing your stock has been under a fair amount of pressure while this uncertainty is out there. So, at what point do you make the call that \u2013 the base plan is so strong that we are maybe better off getting this uncertainty off the table and walk away here?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, Ali. Already \u2013 we've already started with right of way. We've also done other construction-related activities because we don't have time. And so, your question is a very fair question, though, from an investor standpoint. We cannot afford to continue to allow this thing to languish given construction has started, the company is incurring expenses associated with it, our supply contracts. And I think it's probably known now that the target dates for ordering long lead time equipment and that kind of thing through these major contracts was around that August 6 timeframe, and we were able to negotiate and look at the project plans and do a deep dive in terms of what we could possibly do. And that's where the end of August came from.","So \u2013 and in deference to the commissions \u2013 and both commissions, certainly, it appeared Chairman Murphy wanted to take more time, and Chairman Walker wanted to take more time, wished they had more time. Well, we tried to accommodate that by the additional time necessary to get past \u2013 I know there's a lot going on with election season and all kinds of things occurring. So, we're saying the end of August and that's where we're at. And for us to go beyond that is going to be extremely difficult with major commitments of these large capital items and that's just not going to happen without the approvals necessary. So \u2013 and it's not because we're trying to be \u2013 just trying to make sure the commissions are pushed in a very hard fashion. That's not what we're trying to do; it's that we're getting pushed.","And it's unfortunate that we didn't have several years to evaluate this project, but the PTC is the 100% value. The PTC, we're trying to secure for the customer benefits and we've got to be able to finish the project in time to enable that to happen. I mean, it's a 60% off-sale, and if you don't want to take advantage of it, then just tell us. And I think that's basically what I've been saying to the commissions. We've offered this opportunity and it is a real, distinct and positive opportunity, but we need an answer and we need an answer by the end of August and certainly, from the \u2013 you bring up the elements of risk as well from a deal parameter perspective. We've been in negotiations with parties in all of these states and you're seeing the culmination of multiple sets of negotiations with varied parties and I think we've round up with the best balance we possibly could.","So, I'm hopeful that the commissions will look at that and look at the track record and look at what we're trying to do and keep in mind we're spending money to get an answer to help customers. And so, we're fine with doing that because it's a really great opportunity in our opinion and we're intent on trying to provide as much benefit as we can to our customers and that's what we're focused on. So, I hope that answers the question.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. No, I really appreciate that. Brian, one quick one for you. Can you just remind us of the rate increases that you had budgeted for 2018 in your guidance, how much are now locked in for you?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, we were calling for a little bit over $300 million and we're about 80-or-so percent locked in.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We have a question from Steve Fleishman. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. Hi, Nick. So I guess, first just to clarify, the 5% to 7% growth rate \u2013 I think officially you've only given after 2019 but should we interpret that with this capital plan, it would extend through this 2021?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, we've given that \u2013 we've given the detail around it through 2020. Now, we're giving an incremental year, but we see that 5% to 7% growth rate as far as we can see.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Okay. And then, secondly, on Wind Catcher. So, one -there's a reasonable chance that one outcome could be approval with conditions. So, that then leads to another process of do conditions work or not? So, when you're giving this kind of end of August deadline, is that, you just need to make a go\/no-go call by then or...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's right. That's right, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","And it also means \u2013 and you're exactly right on that the deal parameters. We saw the sense of urgency. So, when we sent the letter into the commission, it was really responsive because really the discussion had been around 103% on the cost gap, while SPS was 102.5%, so we changed it to a 102.5%. I mean \u2013 and it's those things that Chairman Walker was bringing up.","Okay, we said, we were going to match up the SPS, then we had the hold harmless provisions. It went even beyond. And I think that \u2013 and that was really responsive to her and her concerns and there are other commissioners' as well, and of course, the Oklahoma Commissioner's too. So, we put our best foot forward to say, this is the parameters of what a deal would look like. And I would say that \u2013 and I had mentioned this earlier in my comments, and I guess it was on purpose \u2013 but there is \u2013 you can play around with the edges, but the main parameters of the deal have been discussed for, really, for a year now. And with multiple parties and those provisions are pretty well-defined. So, for us to take on more risk beyond those parameters is not likely to happen either. So, I guess, I'm just saying, we sort of cut to the chase. And we cut to the chase based on the responses of the \u2013 what the commissioners were telling us and we put our best foot forward.","So, it's \u2013 so our best foot forward is there from a parameter perspective. Our best foot forward is there from a timing perspective. And what I've said all along, we need an answer. And back to Ali's question of, we've had pressure on our stock. Well, because no one knows exactly where we're taking this and I'm just \u2013 guess I'm just reinforcing to you that we're about to take this to a closing, one way or another. Because we've got to get on with other decisions to be made relative to enhancing our shareholders value and that's what we're going to do.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, I guess one other question in that light. So, if you go back about, I think, 6, 12 months, you had talked about concern about the Oklahoma regulatory environment and I don't think you were that happy with the rate order. Early this year and then we'll see what happens with Wind Catcher, but just is that still kind of an issue that's in play based on the outcome here?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","I think, actually \u2013 I think we've made a lot of progress from an Oklahoma standpoint just because of the dialogue that we've been having relative to the Wind Catcher case. And the dialogue that we've had post-rate case environments and pre-rate case environments. I think the issues are becoming more known from an Oklahoma perspective. And I think we've done a really good job of trying to do the best we possibly can for Oklahoma customers. And I think that's starting to get recognized and I really believe that we have the real potential of being on an upward trajectory as it relates to PSO because of \u2013 and I can tell you that there has been a lot of discussion post-rate cases and that kind of thing, but the kind of discussions we've had relative to Wind Catcher and really the stretch that we've put in here to try to do the best we can for Oklahoma customers is not going unrecognized. And so \u2013 and as I mentioned earlier, there will be another rate case filing in the third quarter in Texas and in Oklahoma. And that will be \u2013 I think that will be sort of a new beginning and one where we can really look at the issues in Oklahoma. I think there's a better understanding of the issues and I think we have some great commissioners there that really understand what the issues are. So, we're hopeful that we can make progress there.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Paul Patterson. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hi. How are you doing?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Just right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just procedurally, what should we expect, I guess \u2013 what procedurally is expected to happen on Thursday in Texas? I know you guys are \u2013 have lengthened the period for decision making, but I'm just wondering what \u2013 is it possible to get a decision on Thursday?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, I don't know the answer to that. I think there's probably, in my mind, a couple of options. One is that the commission does decide to vote on the arrangement based on the input that we provided. The other option, probably could be more likely, would be that \u2013 Chairman Walker had talked about coming up with a list of questions and we responded to the ones we knew of. There may be other questions. So, there could be questions answered and then there's two weeks, I think, two weeks from then, is another commission hearing. So, whether we're on the docket or not, I don't know, but there is opportunities now that we've given to the end of August for that kind of thing to occur. So, that's up to the commission. But that's sort of the way that \u2013 the two alternatives that I see.","I'd rather have them approve it at (41:25) Thursday. That'd be great.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yeah, get some closure here. But...","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then, also \u2013 and just to clarify on the Ali Agha's question. There is really, I guess, no sort of Wind Catcher light or \u2013 I mean, basically, it's kind of you guys might do other things, obviously, you're always looking for things and other opportunities, but it sounds like, essentially, it's kind of \u2013 this deal is kind of \u2013 it's kind of a pretty much not really given to any significant modification, if this doesn't have \u2013 if there's a rejection or something like that, we shouldn't think of there being a sort of Wind Catcher light opportunity per se with respect to this project, is that correct?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's correct. I think you could see, I mean, obviously, with the integrated resource plans that we followed, you may see smaller projects develop in some fashion but they could be renewables, may not be renewables. So, you really \u2013 but you won't see another Wind Catcher-like project because that one has \u2013 that one's very unique in its scope and scale and the benefits provided. And so, it's \u2013 you're probably moving to either less efficient type of opportunities and there certainly will continue to develop those kinds of options. But keep in mind, you should look at AEP as a 5% to 7% foundational growth stock with all these little incremental opportunities.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Awesome. Thanks so much.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Operator","We have a question from Angie Storozynski. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey, Angie. How are you?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. How are you?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","So, I have a bigger picture question. So, I mean, the utilities \u2013 electricity utilities (43:26) industry is clearly evolving and I'm trying to have some lessons learned from what have happened in Europe.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And I'm asking this because about 50% of your CapEx plan is transmission spending through 2021 and yet we have seen it in Europe, that transmission CapEx or transmission investments have been falling because utilities are choosing instead to go with distributed generation, sometimes backed by batteries.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Right.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And we're hearing the same types of ideas now coming up from Midwestern utilities. And so, my question is, one, do you think that you need to somehow diversify your growth plan? And two, was the Wind Catcher basically an attempt to become less dependent on the \u2013 on transmission spending or was it some somewhat completely independent?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","It's a big question.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Angie, you should be involved with our strategy sessions because there's no question that this industry is changing dramatically and we recognize that at some point in time transmission will essentially saturate in some fashion, but that horizon is really a decade out. Because in the U.S., which is \u2013 I really talk a lot to the people at RWE Energy, Ineo, (44:53) other areas of Europe as well. And they're much more compartmentalized, but they're also, from a renewables perspective, the renewables are starting to slow down somewhat, at least large scale renewables.","But in the U.S., that's still developing. And what we have to think about, though \u2013 and you're exactly right \u2013 as you bridge from the transmission-related investment, we see the incoming growth strategy around the innovation on the Distribution side. So, in the past, if you think about the way we've been investing, a huge amount of what we invested 5, 10 years ago was generation-related, then it became transmission-related. Now, you're seeing the continued development of transmission. And then, eventually, that will saturate but the growing part of it now is the distribution investment at the operating companies focused on bringing about the \u2013 effectuating the new technologies and development associated with either distributor resources, Big Data analytics, all the optimization activities going on. Those are clearly opportunities for us in the future.","And that's why we're so focused on the customer and focused on making sure that that we are able to deliver those types of technologies where we're part of \u2013 we're the only U.S. utility that's part of an international consortium that does, essentially, a shark tank around the world. And I just got back from California where there were 2,000 start-ups that were evaluated, and it was called down to a list of 15. We're doing pilots with four of them, at least, at this point, and that's where the future is starting to develop.","So, you're exactly right. And the way we see it is bending the O&M curve is a big part of what we're doing, because, obviously, with optimization, efficiencies, digital experiences, all those types of things in order (47:04) to that benefit, but the capitalization will continue to be transmissioned and then you'll see an emerging distribution component of it as well. So, as far as the eye can see, we're in a great shape from an investment standpoint because of that transition.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Praful Mehta. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hey, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","How are you doing?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. So, thanks for all the color on Wind Catcher. I guess \u2013 and you're reiterating the 5% to 7% growth. I guess, my question is, if Wind Catcher does go through, is the right way to think about it is that Wind Catcher will be all incremental growth to the 5% to 7% or will there be some capital allocation limitation when you say the 5% to 7% doesn't all add up with incremental Wind Catcher, but it's somewhere in between? How should we think about that kind of mix if you did get Wind Catcher?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, think of it as incremental. What we've announced to-date, some of that could be pushed out in time, but still within the 5% to 7% growth rate. Does that make sense?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. But there is a little bit of room of something getting pushed out just to kind of fit the Wind Catcher CapEx in there, is that right?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Absolutely.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. All right. And then, given the strong quarter and the weather help I guess in Q2, is there any reason why kind of guidance is maintained right now at the same level?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, you know what a big swing for us the third quarter is and there are big items that will be ins and outs. I think Nick talked about some of the expenses that we're having with Wind Catcher as we go forward in time. It doesn't make sense for us to change the guidance at this point. The way we see it, we're still inside that range that we've identified, and if there's any change to that, we'd likely be making that after the third quarter.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","And there are things that, that we \u2013 we usually use weather as an opportunity to move O&M. So, you could see some O&M move that was in 2019 to 2018 (49:13) or that kind of thing, we typically do that on a regular basis, because we do want to show that certainty and consistency around 5% to 7% in our earnings guidance. Now, you can only do that to a certain extent, right? So, if you do wind up with the rest of the year or like the first part of the year, then who knows how much you can absolutely \u2013 that you can do?","But our view is really that credibility around the guidance that we put out in making sure that we can deliver on that regardless of what's going on with weather as we demonstrated last year, and then continue that as we go forward. So, we'll \u2013 and as Brian said, typically, we wait for third quarter to determine what the future holds in terms of guidance.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's super helpful color. And then, finally, just now that you'll soon have some form of decision on Wind Catcher and tax reform kind of is done and \u2013 or at least mostly known in terms of what to play out the scenarios are, is there any strategic review that we should be thinking about that you guys are looking at in terms of your business mix or just anything that needs to be cleaned up internally? Or do you think, currently, the kind of combination of businesses or utilities you have is the right fit and there's nothing really to be done on the strategic side?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. We've already done it. We already done sort of a major housecleaning. So, we're a pretty pristine stock and when you \u2013 now, that being said, we're always looking at ways to optimize our portfolio and \u2013 but you also have to look at the uses, right?","So, we have a lot of sources, we have a lot of uses. And so \u2013 and certainly our balance sheet is strong, so we can do a lot of things. But obviously, they're all centered upon ensuring that we are able to deliver on the guidance and the growth rates that we've laid out, and that's why we show \u2013 you can \u2013 and this sort of comes and goes. I mean, you can have a jurisdiction or a state jurisdiction that says, okay, it's suffering and maybe we should do something. Well, it takes a little time to really figure out, is that a \u2013 just a systemic problem or do we need to do something about it? But that's really the way we look at it. I mean, it is portfolio management, but its smart portfolio management around the delivery expectations around our growth rate and our guidance.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you.

So, that's why we have to be particularly careful from a risk perspective and that's why we've laid out in the letter what our expectation is. And then, FERC customers are obviously treated differently because of their own arrangements, but that's really the way it works.","Anthony C.

Is this hold harmless or are there other details that are what's delaying it in those two states?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Well, I think, certainly, election season in Oklahoma is pretty distracting. And also, you have some parties in the states, like the Attorney General in Oklahoma, that they did a settlement \u2013 they call it a settlement deal, I don't know what it is. But with the staff that had provisions that were \u2013 they were way off base. So, a lot of discussion about that.","And I think there's just a lot of confusion out there and sometimes you focus so much on the margins of what could happen to this and could happen to that, it's almost like finishing up a contract versus looking at the amazing benefits across the board that are out there. So, you're getting hung up in a lot of that kind of dialogue.","And then, in Texas, you've got the industrials and others that now, the \u2013 (54:38) at least the attorney for the industrials that \u2013 using different gas forecast and all that kind of stuff and it sort of confuses the parties that are listening.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today.","Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining AEP\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. 2015 will be remembered as a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business to drive consistency, execution and discipline while driving toward a strategic vision of what the next premium regulated utility should look like. The balance sheet of AEP is strong and we continue to deliver for our shareholders quarter after quarter from a dividend and earnings growth perspective despite various headwinds that have occurred along the way. This quarter and the year, 2015 are no exceptions.","First, let\u2019s talk about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter \u201815 GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share respectively compared with fourth quarter \u201814 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share respectively. The difference in fourth quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings being mainly driven by the sale of AEP River Operations. Fourth quarter was unusual in the sense that winter particularly in December never occurred. It was more like an April. Even so, operating earnings were consistent with fourth quarter last year even though we gave back approximately $0.11 per share cold weather related load margins finishing the year solidly within our revised guidance range at $3.69 per share operating. The year finished at $4.17 per share on a GAAP basis as well compared with \u201814 results of $3.34 per share and $3.43 per share GAAP and operating earnings respectively.","As can be seen on the graph on the right of Page 3 of the presentation, AEP has consistently performed better than the utility index for the 1, 3 and 5-year periods and as well outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last 3-year and 5-year periods and lagged the index over the last year given the interest rate and other sensitivities in the electric utility sector in general. Overall, AEP continues to perform very well as the story of the stock continues to become more clear and resonate in the market.","Operating earnings growth year-on-year was 7.6% and we achieved our expected regulated ROE of 9.6% for the year, which increased from the 9% experienced in 2014. During 2015, we also increased the dividend by 5.7% on an annualized basis consistent with our earnings growth and within our stated dividend payout range of 60% to 70%. I mentioned AEP is in transition earlier. There were a couple of important milestones that we achieved during the year, particularly in fourth quarter. Namely, AEP completed the sale of River Operations that we discussed during the third quarter 2015 earnings call and we reached the settlement with several parties regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case.","AEP sale of River Operations occurred during the fourth quarter and the transaction occurred according to plan. The cash proceeds were redeployed in advance of the sale by raising our capital forecast for transmission and then by raising our overall capital plan to $5 billion for 2016 at the November EEI Financial Conference, focus on additional regulated operating company and transmission activities. So, we have successfully converted that portion of volatile earnings to a more consistent, regulated earnings profile.","Regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case, we made significant progress by completing a settlement among the parties, including the staff of the PUCO, along with the industrials, Sierra Club, retail providers and others that defines the PPA relationship and the unregulated generation to AEP Ohio customers. The agreement answers the question of how long is long-term? 8 years with a cost based agreement with a return and an adjustment mechanism that works much like a fuel cost pass-through provision. AEP does guarantee up to $100 million credit to customers at the end of the agreement if in the unexpected event the anticipated savings do not materialize. This deal is a great deal for AEP, our customers and the state of Ohio to ensure capacity is maintained for the benefit of customers during a transition period, where markets do not have a long-term capacity product and during the movement toward the clean energy future contemplated by the Clean Power Plan.","AEP also expects to re-power, retire or refuel generation as part of this transition and build up the 900 megawatts of renewable solar and wind generation to achieve a balanced generation portfolio for Ohio\u2019s future. This arrangement, when approved by the Ohio Commission, will be a model that can be used nationally to assess the tone for parties with substantially different positions about generation resources and the pace of change to come together focusing on the clean energy future and the mitigation of transition cost increases that our customers and the public expect. AEP and the utilities in the U.S. are the ones that can bring the parties together to work with the states defined as clean energy future and deploy advanced technologies to improve our customer\u2019s experience while ensuring that the benefits are universal to all the customers.","As with any agreement, AEP and the other parties didn\u2019t get everything they wanted, but this overall is a good deal that provides clarity and will ultimately benefit our customers and should be approved by the PUCO as quickly as possible. We expect the record to be concluded by February 8 and an order from the Commission shortly thereafter. Assuming that\u2019s the case, the spotlight will move to the remaining unregulated generation which we expect the ongoing strategic process to rapidly move to completion. This will set the stage for the next phase of AEP development with a firm financial foundation and position the company for the future.","Moving to expectations for 2016, we reaffirm our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and we will continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation, emphasizing investments in our regulated companies and transmission with CapEx budget of $5 billion for 2016. AEP continues to project long-term earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Additionally, as a result of the available bonus depreciation, as a result of the 2015 tax bill from Congress, and our ability to invest as a result of the incremental cash, we are raising our capital budgets for the succeeding years to $5 billion in 2017 and $5 billion in 2018. This will enable us to put money to work on behalf of our customers for needed infrastructure, including transmission means basically interest-free while maintaining rate base levels that support earnings growth.","Brian will be covering the subject of customer load in a few minutes. But I would like to say since the economic recovery began post-2008, we have seen quarter after quarter of inconsistent results, indicating the economy, while generally getting better, is still challenged in several sectors. Also, we have moved from one extreme to another from a weather perspective from the polar vortex in 2014 to the warmest fourth quarter in the last 30 years in 2015. So, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate sustaining trends at this point. We continue to believe load will increase overall during 2016 albeit at a slightly slower pace than originally forecasted, but not enough for AEP to adjust guidance.","During 2016, we will focus on obtaining approval for the Ohio PPA settlement, continue our strategic review of competitive generation and continue to work with our states on ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan, all with the continued focus on driving efficiencies through lean initiatives, capital allocation, disciplined operational excellence and continual focus on cultural initiatives that I believe is a prerequisite to remain agile and innovative for the future.","Now, I will move over to the equalizer graph, which we go over every quarter and this sort of rolls out for the year. The 2015 earned regulated ROE on the left side of the page and then what we anticipate for the 2016 pro forma regulated ROE on the right side of the page. So, let\u2019s talk about Ohio Power for the Ohio area. AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE that\u2019s forecasted. As far as APCO is concerned, the West Virginia rate case that we got achieved in 2015 addressed the weak returns in West Virginia. So, it helped the ROEs in APCO as well. Rates were implemented in June of 2015. So, we expect to see that the rate case will also help improve the ROE in 2016 for APCO.","Kentucky, it\u2019s good to see it coming up. We are seeing the expected improvement at year end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase in July with 10.25% ROE to be used in weighted average cost of capital for riders and AFUDC. So we continue to see an increase from that perspective, which last quarter as you recall, it was locally short.","I&M achieves an ROE of 10.2%. This was a result of positive regulatory outcomes associated long-term capital investment programs in generation Rockport SCR, solar and nuclear with a critical lifecycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year end 2016. PSO\u2019s ROE is generally in line with expectations. The economy in Oklahoma experienced a slowdown due in part to lower oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state in December though the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented interim rates of $75 million at the first of the year. So a final commission order is expected in the second \u2013 during the second quarter of this year.","SWEPCO continues to be somewhat of a challenge. The operations are strong, but it\u2019s challenged in the oil and gas area, natural gas price area. And as well the continued issue with Arkansas portion of the Turk plant which we continue to analyze alternatives for that, hopefully a retail rate case in Arkansas at some point would be helpful from that perspective.","AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric load and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. AEP Texas continues to monitor the earnings levels and the jurisdictions. They basically have three avenues available to them. One is the transmission, T calls transmission capital cases that they have been involved with currently, and then also, whether it\u2019s a traditional rate case filing or under the legislated approach of the distribution costs recovery factor, that\u2019s another opportunity for them as well. So they can look at earnings and we will focus on those alternatives.","As far as the AEP Transco \u2013 Transmission Holdco, transmission was at 11.1%. It should drop to 10.2% during the year. But obviously, we are spending a huge amount of capital in the transmission area so you do have some lag there. So with that said, overall, the regulated ROEs are moving from 9.6% to an expected 10.1% for the year. So overall, we should have a good year from a regulatory standpoint.","Now that we are in 2016 and before I turn it over to Brian, I will end by saying, I was recently struck by an article I was reading on the 2016 commemoration of 50 years of Star Trek. While it all started with the original series in 1966 with a 5-year mission, it has over the last 50 years, consistently reinvented itself to remain relevant. AEP after 110 years is doing the same thing. This team started out in 2012 after a rough period in Ohio on a 5-year mission of our own that\u2019s set a course toward a firm foundation around execution and discipline to advance operationally, financially and culturally. AEP has performed well since then despite some significant headwinds and as we move into 2016, our focus remains the same to complete our mission to position AEP as the next premium regulated utility. This will provide AEP the firm foundation to reinvent itself by focusing on the customer experience, resources or technologies of the future and disciplined capital allocation to become the model utility of the future. So the next generation is about to begin.","So Brian, make it certainly number one.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year with most of the focus on the annual results. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 6 with the fourth quarter comparison where operating earnings for both years were $0.48 per share despite extremely mild temperatures which adversely affected the quarter by $0.11 per share as well as lower earnings from our competitive businesses. Total company earnings were unchanged from last year. These unfavorable drivers were effectively offset by favorable rate proceedings, the absence of unfavorable regulatory provisions from 2014 and the decline in the effective tax rate, each of which added $0.09 to the fourth quarter of 2015.","Turning to Slide 7, you will see that the fourth quarter\u2019s earnings when added to the results through September pushed our annual operating earnings to $3.69 per share compared to $3.43 per share in 2014, an increase of 7.6%. The increase in earnings for our largest segment, Vertically Integrated Utilities, was the primary factor contributing to the overall increase in earnings. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions and lower O&M and income tax expenses, partially offset by reduced margins from retail and wholesale energy sales.","Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.31 per share to the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers as well as the successful transfer of the Mitchell plant to Wheeling Power. The effective regulatory provisions bolstered boosted earnings by $0.12 per share due to the Virginia legislative change and the unfavorable Kentucky fuel order in 2014. Lower O&M expense for this segment favorably affected comparison by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. Similar to the quarterly comparison, the annual effective tax rate for this segment was lower in 2015 due to the impact of annual tax rate adjustments and the effect of accounting for tax items on the flow-through basis. Partially offsetting these favorable items were declines in normalized margins in our system sales, net of PJM charges. The lower normalized margins which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share were driven by lower usage across most of our operating regions. I will talk more about load in the economy in a few minutes.","The $0.17 per share decline in off-system sales reflects the significant margins realized during the polar vortex events in early 2014 and the soft power prices in 2015. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.72 per share for the year, matching the results for 2014. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effective rate changes and regulatory provisions, offset by lower off-system sales margins and higher O&M expenses. Rate changes added $0.04 per share to earnings, primarily related to the recovery of distribution investment in Ohio.","Unfavorable Ohio regulatory provisions in 2014 that did not repeat created a favorable variance, adding $0.04 per share. The decline of $0.04 per share in earnings related to off-system sales margins was related to the Ohio Commission\u2019s order on OBEC. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for this segment by $0.05 per share. This was due in part to intentional incremental spending with the remaining change related to regulatory commitments in Ohio.","The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.39 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.08 or 26%, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment\u2019s net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $1 billion, an increase of 49%. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.75 per share, down $0.09. However, this segment exceeded expectations in several areas. The lower capacity revenues in Ohio, beginning in June, contributed to Generation Resource\u2019s decline in earnings of $0.11 per share. This was partially offset by the favorable effect of lower fuel costs and favorable hedging activity, helping to add energy margins in the period of soft power prices. In addition, expenses were lower due to unit retirements and the sale of properties which allowed for the reversal of certain ARO liabilities.","Our trading and marketing organization also performed well, exceeding last year\u2019s results by $0.03. Our retail business exceeded 2014 results by $0.04. AEP River Operations, which was sold in mid-November, contributed $0.06 per share to this year\u2019s results, $0.04 lower than 2014. We have been deploying the proceeds from this transaction into our regulated businesses. Corporate and Other produced a loss of $0.06 per share, down $0.07 for the year. The decline was driven by higher O&M expenses, franchise taxes and other costs. Our performance throughout the year resulted in our raising guidance twice with the final results solidly in the latest range. Despite the headwinds associated with lower capacity revenue in Ohio, 2015 was a successful year for AEP, both financially and operationally.","Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance for the quarter. Before we go into particulars by class, I would like to provide some context around the load as depicted on this slide. If just look at the bars, you will notice that they are volatile from one quarter to the next. It\u2019s important to remember that these comparisons are not to the prior quarter but to the prior year. So this year\u2019s fourth quarter is being compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 which as you can see was particularly strong across all classes.","With that context, let\u2019s now plow into the detail for the fourth quarter of 2015. Starting in the lower right, you see there a load decrease by 3.7% compared to the strong fourth quarter results in 2014. This brings the annual normalized load contraction to eight tens of a percent. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales were down 4% for the quarter and 1.8% for the year. While we are starting to see the impact of lower energy prices on a regional economy, most of the decrease is a result of the unusually strong 2014. If you compare our normalized residential sales in 2015 to 2013, volumes were down only by an average of 0.4% per year. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were down 3.9% for the quarter compared to 2014. Both commercial and residential sales were stronger in our Eastern and Western territories, which is consistent with the economic indicators I will share with you on the next slide.","For the year, commercial sales were down 0.2%. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio Power and in I&M, where majority of our auto-related jobs are located. As you know, 2015 was a banner year for domestic auto sales. This was certainly one of the bright spots in our regional economy.","Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter and 0.2% for the year. We saw the biggest decline in our largest sector, primary metals, which was down 21% this quarter. The weak global demand, strong dollar and oversupply of Chinese steel, has created a challenging market for our metals customers and export manufacturers. Fortunately, we continue to see robust growth from our customers in oil and gas related sectors to help offset the decline in manufacturing load. I will provide more detail on this later in the presentation.","Now, let\u2019s review the most recent economic data for AEP service territory on Slide 9. Let\u2019s start on the left hand side of the page, where we compare the economy of the U.S. to that of AEP service territory. For both GDP growth and employment growth, AEP service territory trails the U.S., but both indicators for AEP have been relatively stable for the last several quarters. The interesting detail is on the right side of the slide, where we compare the U.S. indicators to AEP East and AEP West separately. What this shows is U.S. and AEP West GDP and employment growth are slowing, while rates are improving for AEP East. The deceleration in AEP\u2019s western service area is associated with energy sector job losses. The acceleration in AEP\u2019s eastern territory is associated with auto, healthcare and professional service sectors.","U.S. auto sales in 2015 were at their highest level since 2000. We are also seeing exceptional growth in recreational vehicle shipments, which have tripled over the last 5 years. This has been an important boost for places like Elkhart, Indiana, whose economy is largely independent on transportation manufacturing. And finally, the relatively low business costs, along with higher educated workforce in places like Columbus, Ohio, have created an attractive business environment resulting in over 11,000 new healthcare and professional service jobs in 2015.","Turning to Slide 10, I will provide an update on the domestic shale gas activity within AEP\u2019s footprint. Given the impact of low energy prices we are having on our regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, as you can see in the upper left chart, we are still seeing over 10% growth in our sales to oil and gas sectors this quarter despite oil prices being down 40% from last year, rig counts being down by nearly two-thirds and the fact that there are significantly fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of 2014.","In fact, the bottom left chart shows that our sales to oil and gas sectors are at all-time highs. The upper right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components as shown in the bottom left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the pipeline transportation sector, which grew by over 33% in 2015. This was mostly due to the expanding infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales.","Our oil and gas extraction volumes were up nearly 7%, while petroleum and coal product sales grew by approximately 1% in 2015. We still have a number of oil and gas related expansions expected to come online over the next 18 months that should drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. Obviously, we are monitoring the situation closely, given current oil prices and we will update you on these segments throughout the year. In contrast to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper left chart show that sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 5.3% for the quarter.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by 0.2% this quarter and is now in a healthy 53.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.5x and 20.8% respectively. Our qualified pension funding held firm this quarter at 97%. During the quarter, a slight decrease in the asset returns was offset by a slight increase in the discount rate. Our pension assets are now weighted at 60% and duration matching fixed income securities with the balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance in 2014 to better align the investment portfolio with the pension obligation.","Our OPEB obligations remain fully funded, but decreased from 112% to 109% during the quarter. Although plain investment returns were positive, they were more than offset by an increase in higher healthcare costs. Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.5 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend over for the summers of 2017 and 2018.","Let\u2019s see if we can wrap this up on Slide 12 and then quickly get to your questions. The employees of American Electric Power have a proven track record. Over the last several years, they have delivered operating earnings growth within our targeted 4% to 6% range and we have grown the dividend in line with earnings. With the current dividend at the midpoint of annual operating earnings guidance, we anticipate paying out 61% of total earnings and 68% of regulated earnings in 2016. Our employees have executed continuous improvement initiatives, lean activities and have begun the cultural transformation that has allowed us to keep expenses in a very tight range of $2.8 million to $3.1 billion net of earnings offsets since 2011. We forecast expenses net of offsets this year to be in the $2.8 billion range. In addition, our employees have been thoughtful about every $1 of investment in our system. We have allocated more dollars to the wire side of our business and designed our Transco business to allow for the efficient deployment of low cost capital for the benefit of our customers.","At this point, let me say a word about bonus depreciation. This cash saving vehicle is not new to us. For several years now, AEP has elected bonus depreciation. During this time, the company has consistently grown rate base and earnings. Earlier, you heard Nick announce that we will increase our capital spending by $1 billion in both 2017 and 2018. Our customers will realize improved service at a savings due to the rate reducing impacts of the regulatory flow back of accumulated deferred income taxes and AEP will be able to grow earnings. In this way, our community\u2019s benefit through increased economic activity, our customers benefit through rate savings and our debt and equity holders benefit through the maintenance of our cash flow metrics as we grow our net plant and service. The ability to make incremental investment in our own system for the benefit of our customers differentiates AEP.","Looking ahead to 2016, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of between $3.60 to $3.80 per share. We are keeping our CapEx plans for 2016 at $5 billion while increasing our CapEx forecast in 2017 and 2018 to $5 billion per year. And finally, as Nick said, we anticipate getting clarity on the Ohio PPA and the strategic review of our competitive businesses. We experienced the successful 2015 and are poised for success in 2016 and beyond.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Greg. How are you?","Greg Gordon","I am well. My first question goes to your last point, when I look at Slide 31 of the handout, certainly one of the hallmarks of the company under your management has been a very, very focused on balance sheet integrity. And what I see here is that from \u201816 to \u201818, you are \u2013 even with the increase in capital spending, because there is such a significant increase in cash from operations, your \u201816 to \u201818 excess capital required is down by $1.1 billion, plus your debt capital market needs are also down by $1.1 billion, doesn\u2019t that basically flow to retained earnings and further potentially strengthen the balance sheet from here?","Nick Akins","It does, Greg. And so the issue is, part of what we talk about here is increasing the CapEx sum. But as we get the increase in retained earnings that also increases our ability to access debt capital markets and we will be reviewing that as we evaluate our plans as we enter a period where we will be spending in order to get ready for the Clean Power Plan and other opportunities like that later this decade.","Greg Gordon","But it\u2019s fair just eyeballing this to say that exiting \u201818, the balance sheet should be in an even stronger position than it is today, unless you decide to spend further capital over the period?","Brian Tierney","Yes. We have not consumed all of the excess cash that bonus depreciation extension has created for us.","Greg Gordon","Great, that was my key question. Thanks. I will let somebody else ask and go the back if I have more.","Nick Akins","Yes. It is interesting Greg, that this time around, Congress instead of waiting until the end of the year to give the existing year, they did the 5 years. So it really helped in terms of the cash and capital planning. And you are right we didn\u2019t have it utilized all of the capital available to us. But nevertheless, we will continue to focus on additional opportunities for us, particularly as it relates to infrastructure spending.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hello, just a follow-up on Greg\u2019s question. Does that mean that you could in theory lever up more on certain subsidiaries as for just transmission going forward, is that one of the possibilities?","Brian Tierney","Yes. So debt avoidance is one of the possibilities that we are looking at. Obviously, the closest thing that we have done is spending incremental CapEx. But debt avoidance and\/or levering up our opportunities that the incremental cash makes available to us.","Michael Weinstein","I am just thinking of the stronger balance sheet you could also lever \u2013 increase the leverage on that subsidiary?","Brian Tierney","We could, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And then also I was wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail as to why you think sales forecast for the shale plays will continue to be in 0.9% or continue to grow going forward that you don\u2019t see any potential problems, I guess in the next 2 years or considering the low prices?","Nick Akins","It is interesting because we continue to see more and more opportunities for the electric load to continue to pick up in addition to compressor loads, optimization within the fields of sales, improved production of the existing wells, that continues. And of course, we are also looking very closely at new opportunities that are coming online that have been identified, engaging the progress of them coming in 2016 as well. So we continue to \u2013 and we are in very close touch with our customers out there, particularly ones who have discussed expansion or addition of new facilities and keeping in touch with them about timing of projects and the additional load associated with that. So we are keeping our ear close to the ground on all of that activity.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Hi guys.","Nick Akins","Hello.","Praful Mehta","Hi, my question was firstly on the EPS and cash flow guidance that you have for \u201816 and obviously the cash flow guidance going out as well, what is embedded in that in terms of both the PPA and also the outcome of the strategic review?","Nick Akins","Yes. We don\u2019t have anything in there for that forecast at this point. And what we will do, obviously we want to get the PPA done and evaluate fully where we are at in terms of not only the incremental, any incremental earnings associated with the PPA. But obviously, we have other factors we are looking at in terms of load and other issues to look at. So we will deal with that one when that time comes.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Just to be clear, if there is a PPA, outcome is positive, then that obviously is an incremental upside to the guidance you have right now, is that fair?","Nick Akins","So we have to work through that process and fully understand it first. So I don\u2019t want to get out on a limb and tell you that that would be the case. But obviously, getting the PPA in place will be very good for the company. But we are also looking at, like I said other things that may \u2013 because I think at the first quarter, we will probably have a better handle on what load looks like and then see that the relative degree of consistency to make it good, really a good forecast in terms of guidance and that kind of thing.","Brian Tierney","Praful, I think if we were to get new data sets around a PPA and\/or disposition of a business, I think it would be incumbent on us to provide and update the guidance and we would do that.","Praful Mehta","Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then secondly, I heard there is rumblings around a legal challenge associated with the PPA, who knows where that goes, but just trying to understand, if that legal challenge comes up, how does that impact strategic review of the non-PPA assets, because I am assuming the outcome of that legal challenge would have an impact on the buyers view about the value of the assets?","Nick Akins","Well, okay, so let\u2019s keep in mind there is really two sets of assets here. One is the ones that are covered under the PPA. And the other are probably rumblings and probably more than rumblings. At this point there is filings have been made apparently. And if you have the PPA piece of it, that\u2019s really about 3,000 megawatts of generation nominally. Then you have the other 6,000 megawatts out there normally that would be associated with the remaining unregulated. So if there is a case out there, I think anyone that would look at it, if it\u2019s only unregulated part of the generation, they \u2013 there will be people who are buying unregulated assets and fully understand the risk associated with that. As far as the PPA is concerned, we will continue to progress associated with the PPA. Those cases will work themselves through. We feel like we are in very good shape from a legal perspective. There is a lot of dust being kicked up. But that\u2019s what happens when you try to do progressive things, particularly things that have the state supported self as opposed to waiting on a Federal outcome for a long-term capacity market for example. So I think any perspective buyer in a transaction on unregulated generation, they would fully understand what the issues are and the risk involved.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning guys.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Christopher Turnure","I have more kind of CapEx and balance sheet questions here to kind of follow on some of the previous questions as well. First, on the incremental CapEx of $2 billion over 2 years, kind of what\u2019s embedded in that, it looks like it\u2019s mostly transmission related, but is there any incremental renewables in there that stem from the PPA settlement. And then also on your ability to finance that capital kind of how do you think about the moving parts there, especially in \u201817 and \u201818 given the fact that you are not assuming any kind of asset sale proceeds, any PPA incremental cash. And I think my understanding of your tax situation was that even though bonus depreciation is certainly adding to your potential in outer years, you probably wouldn\u2019t have been a cash tax payer in \u201817 and \u201818 anyway. So how does the bonus depreciation going to help your cash in those years to finance some of this incremental capital?","Nick Akins","So let me touch the point on what\u2019s covered under the $2 billion that\u2019s included. Yes, you are right, a majority of it is transmission. And then there is some on the rest of the regulated activity. But there is also a piece in there associated with as you mentioned renewable projects. But it\u2019s not related to the PPA. It\u2019s really not to the Ohio PPA. It\u2019s related to other arrangements, there are other PPA arrangements that we have for long-term PPAs with solar projects, universities and that kind of thing. So it very much supports what we are trying to achieve from a customer side of things. We go out and we participate in arrangements that with long-term PPAs with creditworthy counterparties to ensure that we can put those kinds of facilities in place. And you see a category there. I think that\u2019s competitive parts, where that competitive part is really around our onsite partners\u2019 opportunities associated with projects that they are doing with that are supported by long-term PPAs.","Brian Tierney","So \u2013 and let me address Chris for the last part of your question. Without the extension of bonus depreciation, we were going to be significant taxpayers beginning in 2016 and in 2017 and going forward. So, this does significantly change our cash position. And as Nick just said in his response, we have not committed dollars yet for the renewables associated with the PPA. If that\u2019s gets passed, that will be an opportunity for incremental investment that\u2019s currently not in our CapEx plans. And if there were any proceeds from sale of any assets or businesses that we have that would be incremental to our balance sheet and cash flow position as well.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. That\u2019s very clear. And then just another kind of follow-up on the load side here. You mentioned that you do kind of expect somewhat of a continuance in the E&P and energy-related sectors there in growth or at least stability there. Kind of what else are you thinking in terms of growth by customer class that underlies your 80 basis points of growth overall for next year?","Nick Akins","Well, certainly, all our manufacturing, travel and leisure, those categories continue to grow. Brian, you may have others?","Brian Tierney","Healthcare and business services are other areas that we are seeing growth, particularly in places like Ohio and I&M.","Nick Akins","We mentioned RV sales and I remember when President Obama was running for office in 2008, one of the places that he was going is the sign of a downturn economy was Elkhart, Indiana. And if you look at Elkhart, Indiana now, it\u2019s just absolutely booming with RV sales being up as much as they are. So, that\u2019s another sector where we are seeing significant improvement.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell","Hey, good morning. I appreciate the Star Trek reference in last quarter, but back to the future. Just a couple of questions. First, easy one on your favorite equalizer slide, transmission ROE is coming down in \u201816. You said there is some lag there. Do you think that returns back in \u201817?","Nick Akins","I don\u2019t have those numbers, but I would expect as we continue to accelerate transmission, I think it will probably stay pretty steady be my guess, but we obviously have to look at the investment cycle there, but obviously transmission continues to be a near-term investment recovery perspective and as long as we can accelerate it and bring those earnings in, which we started to do obviously last year, then we can mitigate the impact of the ROE drop. And then you also have couple of other things that are occurring in there as well. ETT, ROE is also forecasted to decrease from 11.7 down to 10.4. So, that\u2019s sort of embedded in there as well. And obviously, you will have interim T calls, filings need to be made. And so I fully expect it to stay relatively consistent with that.","Anthony Crowdell","Also staying with the equalizer slide if I look at Kentucky Power, I mean, that\u2019s the smallest ball here. I guess, it\u2019s the smallest contributor for earnings. With the market and people paying exorbitant premiums for at least some of these smaller utilities, any thought of monetizing that? It doesn\u2019t really seem instrumental into the AEP story and it\u2019s also lagging your ROEs there.","Brian Tierney","I get that question quite often. And Kentucky, on the one hand, it certainly is a regulated jurisdiction. So, we are still in the process of becoming more fully regulated and I sort of measure it up from that approach. Number one, it\u2019s a regulated entity. Number two, it\u2019s been one that it was one of the first to do a rider for cyber. It was one of the first to allow the transfer of Mitchell. So, while it maybe small, there are some positive things about that jurisdiction that we obviously have to take a look at. But what you are saying obviously is we see that going on in the market as well. But at this point, we are focused on being a premium regulated utility and that means we need to deal with the issues that everyone is asking us about and that is our strategic discussion around the unregulated generation. So, that\u2019s really where our primary focus, if we did something with a regulated entity at this point, we would become more unregulated and that\u2019s not the direction that we are going.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions. First, if you have any update around timing of merchant sale how you are thinking about that? I know you said you expect Ohio PPA order soon after the briefs are done. And then second on the O&M slide, the $2.8 billion for \u201816, ex-riders and trackers, maybe is that a fair assumption to kind of back into what that is from \u201815 and assume that continues or maybe provide some guidance around what that is for riders and trackers? Thank you.","Nick Akins","Yes. I will let Brian cover the second one. On the first one, on the merchant sale piece as you talked about, I think the timing is still, as I said earlier, we need \u2013 it\u2019s sequential in terms of outcomes, but not sequential in terms of the activity that\u2019s going on. We are already in a strategic process around the unregulated generation. The question is what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out? So, we will get through the PPA approach with Ohio. Hopefully, they will make a decision here and it should be after over 2 years, be in a decent decision to make a decision quickly. And then we know and understand what we are dealing with, with the rest of the fleet. And so that process we would expect would move very quickly and I would expect us to be in a good position to get that done as quickly as possible as well and that is a focus to make sure that we complete that activity in 2016.","Brian Tierney","Gregg, this is Brian. A little bit over $1 billion in offsets that we are talking about in terms of trackers. And in terms of how we get there from \u201815 to \u201816 in O&M it\u2019s employee-related expense. It\u2019s one-time reductions that we will be doing and we have been planning for the reduction in capacity revenues in Ohio now for the last 3 years. So we have had as a management team, our focus on the fact that they go away fully in 2016 so whether it\u2019s lean initiatives, procurement initiatives, one-timers that we are doing, some of the benefit that we got in 2015, we are able to move expenses out of \u201816 into \u201815. We have really been very, very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline for the first full year of no capacity revenues in Ohio and it\u2019s all those initiatives together that are allowing us to get to that $2.8 billion level.","Gregg Orrill","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Ridzon","Good morning. Just wondering what you are seeing as far as buyer interest out there? Are you still talking to private equity? This would be for the non-PPA assets?","Brian Tierney","Well, we have had to be really careful with that obviously. We do have an ongoing process and I would not be surprised if private equity involved with that, because they are interested in that kind of business. But I probably should stop there, because obviously, that\u2019s an ongoing process.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","Can you hear me?","Nick Akins","Yes, yes.","Paul Patterson","I am sorry, okay. I wanted to touch base to you on two things. Just first on the non-PPA merchant plants, just I apologize if I am a little slow on this. What is exactly the decision process on them?","Nick Akins","So, once we get past the PPA part of the approach, then on the rest of those assets, it really is centered around number one valuation, because these, we feel, like are really competitive units and ones that positioned well in the marketplace. So if there is an opportunity to understand what the valuation of that is. And obviously, there is ensuring that there are parties involved that are interested in those assets. And so we will go through that process very quickly. And there is \u2013 certainly, there is an opportunity there. But we obviously want to understand what the economics look like for that kind of transaction and what it means to our business going forward. And this is not a share of sale. So we are going to be very mindful about what it means to our shareholders in terms of not only in terms of any potential dilution if that exists or what we do with the proceeds. It\u2019s just as important as the question of what you do with the assets in sales. There is a multitude of different things that we have to think about in that process. As you know, we are in a pretty good cash position, capital position right now. And to go through that process or it could be more cash associated with that. So we have to really think about just as much on the use of proceeds and obviously what it does to shareholders as well. So we will go through that process and really that\u2019s the nature of it. And it\u2019s a relatively simple process for the set of units.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then with the [indiscernible] energy what have you challenge that was made at FERC regarding the waiver, they want the waiver rescinded regarding the affiliate PPA, what \u2013 do you guys have any comments on that?","Nick Akins","Yes. We feel pretty strongly about our position. And obviously, they perceive that maybe they didn\u2019t think we would even get this close to getting the PPA done. And we have PPAs now. We have got PPAs for solar in Ohio. We have OBEC generation that\u2019s under a PPA. We have got in other regulated jurisdictions and there is no difference between those activities and what we are doing here. And really, it centers on the notion of whether there is customer choice or not. And in fact, FERC has said before the customer choice does exist in Ohio. Leads us up to Ohio determines the mechanism under which that proceeds and there is precedence for that. So we feel pretty strongly about our position. I think as far as FERC is concerned, it\u2019s asked and answered. And I think when you look at the case that\u2019s been filed, I would presume they proceed of trying to address it there when they may be have difficulty addressing Ohio and we have had a case for 2 years where they could have been involved with that and our settlement is, keep in mind, we have a settlement with a lot of significant parties in this case. So yes, there are some on the outside looking in and they are going to do what they need to do. But the settlement of the parties exists. It\u2019s a good settlement. And certainly, it\u2019s one that addresses the Ohio issues and that\u2019s what we are about. I don\u2019t know, they have their own motivations about what they want to achieve. But we are wanting to achieve consistency from a pricing perspective for consumers protection, for consumers for a sliver of their energy needs. But customers still have the ability to choose in Ohio. They can choose any supplier. So \u2013 and that has not changed. So I think we feel good about it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Nick Akins","Good morning Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning Nick. Nick, I wanted to clarify points you have made earlier. So as you are looking at these sales of the non-PPA merchant assets, we are looking at a market where commodity prices are down, the valuation on public equity merchant power stocks down significantly. So how big of a concern is that and I mean is that a scenario where if the price is not right you stay back and you keep this or strategically as you have emphasized to us many times, you want this to be 100% regulated business, just wanted to understand your thought process in terms of how this plays out?","Nick Akins","Yes. As we look at this, yes, you could look at the present energy market, present natural gas prices. And a lot of people get hung up on, if prices are high, then the world has changed and there is assumptions about what valuations are to be and when the world is low, there is again 180 degrees different assumptions about how the world ought to be. These decisions are made on long-term decisions and mainly driven by capacity markets. And for buyers of these assets, they are looking at long-term capacity markets and long-term energy prices. And they are making bets based upon where they think those energy prices are going to go. So it\u2019s the same discussion that we would have before. But again, these are a great set of assets. And for anyone, even on a low energy market, you have got to look at margins and margins are what\u2019s driving the valuation. So and then from a capacity market, the same thing. So I think there are so many \u2013 if you look out in the long-term, there are so many issues involved here. There is going to come down to any valuation would be around what someone else perceives the forward curve to be for capacity and for energy and then our version of it and we will see where it goes. But if somebody comes in and tries to lowball us, then we feel pretty good about these assets. They sit really good in the market and \u2013 but our presumption going in is that we will determine the outcome of what we do with these assets.","Ali Agha","So just to clarify, Nick, I mean on the one hand, is that a strategic decision made at AEP, look these assets are going in one way or another, we are 100% regulated over the division be more sensitive to valuation as you are suggesting?","Nick Akins","There is going in, we plan on being the next premium regulated utility. And that is the strategic driver. Now valuation, obviously we have to look at and make determination, well is the valuation consideration enough for us to move ahead from that perspective. Because keep in mind, I mean you are looking at things like currency value improvement, PE multiple improvement, multiple expansion, what you do with the proceeds, all those types of things that are also part of the evaluation. Because with River Ops, we changed from a volatile earnings stream to one that by reinvesting that cash we were able to focus on a continual, consistent earnings growth stream. And that\u2019s what \u2013 how we are looking at this as well. I mean it\u2019s a volatile. It may be great, it may be positive, but it\u2019s still volatile. And so we have to look at that and determine the balance of that kind of determination versus what we can do with the proceeds and ensure shareholder value on a consistent basis going forward. That\u2019s the way we look at it. So unless somebody \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t think we are going to get any low balls in this thing. I really don\u2019t believe that because it\u2019s a great set of assets.","Ali Agha","Understood. Last question, unrelated, just to be clear on the bonus depreciation, so the CapEx goes up in \u201817, \u201818, obviously has positive earnings implications, but more near-term in \u201816, any earnings headwinds from bonus depreciation we should be factoring to our thinking for this year?","Brian Tierney","No.","Nick Akins","No, we are one of the utilities that has a ready willing and able, remember the transmission graph we always have, the green and the blue on top that we were looking for capital. We found capital.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question is from word from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning everyone.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","Sorry if this question was asked. I had to hop on late. But just on the higher CapEx call that you released this morning, just want to confirm, is there still levers to increase that budget under the assumption the you sell the 5 gigawatts, so can you redeploy it, avoid some sort of dilution or are we thinking a little bit more buybacks now that you have already raised you CapEx?","Brian Tierney","Sure. So the plan that we have laid out does not assume anything around proceeds of sale from non-PPA assets. So the plan that you have is a business as usual CapEx plan and the things were to change, I anticipate that Nick and I will come out with revised guidance and use of proceeds.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, good. So, you could reaccelerate further CapEx additions about what we have done today?","Nick Akins","All the things that are available for people to do with proceeds or things that would be available to us, we obviously look first to reinvest in our organic businesses and with the incremental cash that we got associated with bonus depreciation that was our first and best use of those dollars. So, they are obviously a spade of other things that are available to us. But you would anticipate Nick and I would come out and tell you what those things would be at that time.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Excellent, okay. And then just one last question on the strategic review of the 5 gigawatts, obviously, there is obviously potential buyers here. Is there some optionality in this transaction where you can layer in the other 3 gigawatts if you don\u2019t get the PPA approved? Is that \u2013 is there \u2013 is there sort of that optionality?","Nick Akins","Yes, if the PPA is not approved, then all of the assets will be in that strategic evaluation.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. As I go through the story this quarter, I would say that, overall, it was actually an impressive quarter to come in at a respectable $1.01 per share and consistent with guidance given the headwinds of this being the sixth-mildest winter that we've had here in our service territory in 30 years and the intentional O&M advance spending that we described for you earlier in the year that we have continued.","Our continued emphasis on regulated investments, particularly in the transmission area, that we then disciplined with advance spending from 2016 into 2014 and '15. And the focus on operating company performance continues to define the trajectory of consistent, dependable financial and operational performance. Keep in mind, we are in the middle of a multiyear plan to reposition our company, focused on infrastructure investments, particularly in the transmission and regulated utility lines of our business, improving our customer service through process and technology improvements, transforming our generation resources and defining an employee culture that enables the adaptability, flexibility and entrepreneurship that the future will demand. I would like to reiterate that this is a multiyear plan that began in 2013 focused on consistent earnings and dividend improvement. And we are still on target within the plan we laid out at EEI 2 years ago.","We are taking advantage of opportunities around incremental transmission investments, advanced O&M spending made available from the first quarter performance and continue to drive efficiencies as we redefine processes through employee-led lean initiatives. All of these activities serve to mitigate the impacts of the, for lack of a better description, growing pains of dealing with the negative circumstances of the 2016 PJM capacity auction and Ohio deregulation-induced financial impacts. These mitigation activities have enabled the continued confirmation of our previous guidance ranges and growth rates for the 2014 to '16 period. There will no doubt be some growing pains, such as potential regulatory lag conditions or settlements that may reduce front-end revenues to accommodate longer-term business plan gains or the potential for mismatches between O&M efficiency gains and earnings test. These are examples of headwinds that may temper our earnings growth, but our investment strategy and the agility to compensate along the way continue to confirm our earnings trajectory. We will discuss this in more detail in November at the upcoming EEI Conference.","I'm pleased to report that we are nearing the range for our 2014 guidance, the $3.40 to $3.50 per share from $3.35 to $3.55 per share as we tune in toward the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, our GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter came in at $1.01 per share, and for the -- year-to-date earnings stand at $2.95 per share. This compares with third quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share and $1.10 per share operating earnings. And year-to-date 2013 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share and $2.63 operating earnings. AEP's Board of Directors also recently declared a dividend increase of $0.03 per share to $0.53 per share for the quarter, which represents a 6% annualized increase indicating their continued confidence in our business plan performance.","Load growth in our service territory continues especially in the industrial sector, while there has been some commercial growth, and residential growth is still lagging. This segment will likely take time to recover and needs consistency with industrial and commercial growth. Both the industrial and commercial sectors have experienced several quarters of growth, so we'll be watching these metrics closely for trends. Brian will cover this subject in more detail in a few minutes.","Briefly covering some of the regulatory activities that are ongoing, starting with the Ohio PPA filing that we made in October. This filing request approval from the PUCO to allow AEP Ohio to enter into a PPA arrangement with AEP Generation Resources for 100% of AEP Generation Resources share of several Ohio-based generating units, amounting to about 2,671 megawatts, and it's for the life of these units. This PPA would be separate but additional to the already requested OVEC generation through a PPA rider, which would be approved in the ESP 3 filing that is presently before the commission. These generating units represent about 1\/3 of the Ohio-deregulated fleet. Placing these units in a PPA will preserve Ohio jobs, tax base, and more importantly, provide a hedge to Ohio customers to mitigate price increases in the future. We estimate that this PPA arrangement will save customers approximately $224 million over the next 10 years and will provide the stability of revenues to maintain and invest in these generating units, a true win-win. We already have PPA arrangements with other resources, such as renewables and energy efficiency. And the PPA rider is legal given that SB 221 allows for non-bypassable riders of this sort. AEP has asked for expedited approval by June 1 of next year.","In our continued efforts to benefit our regulated jurisdictions with the transfer of Ohio-deregulated assets that were depended upon previously to satisfy capacity requirements through the AEP generation pool, we now have a settlement in West Virginia for the transfer of 100% of the 50% interest in the Mitchell plant into the rate base of Wheeling Power. This is a proposed settlement and subject to the UI [ph] commission approval. But it states that only 82.5% will go into rates initially with the other 17.5% going to rates no later than January 1, 2020. Until then, the 17.5% will essentially function in the deregulated market where the proceeds for capacity, energy and other services will accrue to the benefit of shareholders, much like off-system sales. There will also be an off-system sales sharing mechanism in place for the regulated 82.5% of generation as well as other provisions in the settlement as well. A hearing was held on October 21, and we await a commission decision. This is a good agreement in which taking a short-term risk with the 17.5% was worth the long-term benefits toward our regulated business plan.","So before I go into the PJM market reform, and for that matter, the EPA Clean Power Plan, I'll now go to the equalizer chart, which usually is what I call it, on the next page. So as we go through the individual jurisdictions, and I'll sort of characterize this against last quarter as well, this thing tends to be a snapshot from quarter-to-quarter. And as you can probably see and have seen from the last quarter, the overall ROE has come down. This is the regulated entities, remember. So -- and most cases -- and I'm probably going to be redundant when I go through this is, is most of the impact that you see relative to lower ROEs is because of the advanced O&M spend that we had previously put in place, which we've continued to do because we did get ahead in the first quarter and were able to take on that additional expense, and also the unfavorable weather for the quarter. As I said earlier, it was one of the coolest summers we've had in decades. So in fact, in July, I think it was the coldest July we've had since 1979. So definitely, we've absorbed some things, and that's what driven down the ROEs in general for that period of time. Because of the unregulated generation revenues from the first quarter, the effective ROE would be, certainly be higher than that for the -- and above the 10%. So we have -- we've come along very well. We continue to make progress, and as I go through some of these jurisdictions, we'll talk about some of the issues going on.","So starting with Ohio power. Last quarter, it was at 14%. And as we told you last time, it was heading down to get -- toward the SEET levels. And it continues to do that. It's at the 12.6% level this quarter, and we continue to make progress in that regard.","As far as APCo is concerned, APCo is at 8.3%. And it was low last quarter as well at 8.5%. So there has been some weather-adjusted activities and O&M activities, but the main issue there is we have a West Virginia rate case that has been filed in that jurisdiction for $226 million. $45 million of that is a vegetation management rider, and the earned ROE for West Virginia is really where we have the issue. It's approximately 5.8% as filed in the rate case. So we have a lot of work to do in the West Virginia jurisdiction. Virginia, we believe, is certainly within the earnings collar that exists based on that legislation. So our issue there is West Virginia. We know that, and we're working on it.","In Kentucky, the ROE is certainly -- continues to be a challenge, but there has been some improvement. It was 7.4%. It's up to 8.4% this quarter, primarily because of off-system sales. But obviously, we're in the process of working through to file a rate case at the end of 2014 that will reflect the full recovery of Mitchell. And that case is expected to be effective in July of 2015. So that's a work in progress as well.","For I&M. I&M came down from 10.8% to 9.1%. And the biggest driver there was the 2014 earnings were much lower because of the unfavorable O&M and weather-related conditions.","And then as far as PSO is concerned, PSO actually came down from 9.1% to 8.3%, again because of weather and the Western footprint. Weather was significantly off. And of course, a lot of the O&M spend also occurred at PSO as well. They also have a settlement of their rate case that's before the commission as well.","And then, SWEPCO. SWEPCO will continue to be a challenge because of the portion of Turk that is not in a rate base yet, but we do have a supportive PFD from the Texas Commission at this point relative to transmission expense. And we continue to look for improvement there. But it'll take time to get the Turk portion worked out. Probably, it'll be some time -- it'll probably impact earnings in 2016 before we're able to go after resolution of that issue.","And then as far as AEP Texas is concerned, they're still hanging out there at that 12.4%, and that really reflects the stranded cost issues that we've talked about, recovery issues we talked about earlier. And then the AEP Transco is doing very well. Transmission Holdco has returned, is at the 11.4%, which is in line with its authorized return. Now it's at 11.9%, so doing very well from a transmission perspective.","So as we move forward, let me go ahead and cover the PJM market and the EPA Clean Power Plan. There's been much discussion regarding the PJM capacity market reform, particularly regarding the PJM capacity performance proposal and their demand resource white paper. As a general concept, we agree with the approaches, as we have said earlier, that adequate and consistent price signals need to be provided so that generation can be maintained and additional investment made.","Regarding the capacity proposal, PJM is looking at placing some limitations on clearing price volatility, which would be a positive move. And progress appears to be -- been made with regard to the severity of the proposed penalty provisions. We disagree with PJM regarding the applicability of penalty provisions on FRR entities, such as our fully integrated regulated space, because they have resource responsibility. We are working with others to develop comments to these proposals before PJM files for FERC by December 1.","Regarding the DR demand resource white paper proposals, the current thinking is that DR will participate on the demand side with the load-serving entities. So DR will realize the benefits from avoided costs and reserve requirements instead of direct payments from the auctions. However, FERC will need to provide direction on the DR issue as they respond to the DC Circuit Court order. So stay tuned as many of these capacity auction-related issues are addressed, but we believe significant auction issues are finally being discussed and expect improvements to be made.","Our previously discussed AEP's thoughts regarding the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan. Generally, the cornerstone assumptions are not realistic. The timetables are much too aggressive. And it's just too complicated for the states, markets and stakeholders to comprehend without a well-thought-out plan for development and execution. The EPA's proposed rules will generally require a fundamental change in the way the electric grid, capacity and energy markets and the state review and approval processes function.","For those of us like myself, who grew up planning, building and running the power system of today, it is the backbone of everything we do in society. We happen to take the continued reliable operation of the power system seriously. I instructed my team here at AEP to run system planning and performance studies, typically known as load-flow studies, that engineers use to plan and confirm the reliable operation of the grid. And I asked them to assume the EPA 2020 cornerstone assumptions and add generation that's included in the PJM Q. The results of those studies found widespread occurrences of voltage degradation, collapse, and in fact, cascading outages of the electric grid. These results are even before any contingency outages, such as loss of generation or transmission facilities. The Southwest Power Pool ran their own studies and confirmed the same results for their region of the country, which we also serve. FERC should require NERC and the RTOs to perform these studies as they will no doubt confirm the same results. But proper technical analysis needs to be done as a part of the review of the EPA-proposed plan so that we can arrive at a rational result that enables progress from an environmental perspective with a more balanced set of resources, while at the same time preserving the reliable grid we have today.","If you hear someone say the proposed plan is okay, they probably have not run a load-flow or stability study of the system and have either depended upon a market study or some other generalization. There is a better way to meet our environmental objectives by working together at commonsense solutions. The 2020 timetable requirements must be dropped and the states be given the flexibility to do the proper analysis to formulate plans. They -- this will provide not only operationally efficient results but also financially efficient results as we achieve the environmental solutions that we're asking our grid to perform through this transformation. AEP stands ready to engage in that dialogue.","Now regarding the unregulated business. We continue to make progress to improve the value proposition of the business by focusing on cost containment, investment decisions reflecting market signals, pushing for capacity market design changes and working at the state level with PPA approaches. Additionally, we continue to work with our board regarding the available options to further shareholder value and define milestones and objectives regarding varying issues associated with this business. And we'll work -- continue to do that work in 2015. AEP will continue in defining itself as a regulated utility by providing consistent and quality dividends and earnings potential. Any decision and the timing of those decisions will be dictated by that focus.","Now I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone.","On Slide 5. You will see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 by segment for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods. As I did in July, I will focus my remarks primarily in the quarterly results. You can find the details for the year-to-date comparison in the appendix.","Operating earnings for the third quarter were $493 million or $1.01 per share compared to the $1.10 per share or $533 million recorded last year. These results, when combined with the results through June, pushed our year-to-date earnings to $1.4 billion or $2.95 per share compared to $2.63 per share or $1.3 billion earned in 2013. Our year-to-date results remain strong compared to last year driven by weather-related sales combined with strong operations during this past winter. The third quarter dampened these results somewhat due to mild weather and increased O&M as a result of shifting in timing. On the positive side, we continue to see growth in earnings through rate changes and our Transmission Holdco segment where we expect to meet or exceed our original guidance of $0.29 per share by year end.","With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on Slide 6. Third quarter earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.45 per share, down $0.11 from last year's results. Weather adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.05 per share due to mild temperatures across much of our service territory. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for this segment by $0.10 per share. The higher O&M was due in part to improved incremental spending, including shifting costs from future years, primarily in our generation and wires functions. O&M was also impacted by an increase in employee-related costs and the effect of certain credits recorded in 2013. Depreciation expense was higher year-over-year due to increased capital investment. This lowered earnings by $0.03 per share.","Positive comparisons to last year include rate changes, which added $0.02 for the quarter. This increase in rates is related to incremental investment to serve our customers. Normalized retail margins contributed $0.01 per share to the year-over-year growth, driven by increased sales in the industrial class, primarily offset by lower sales to the residential class. I will talk more about the loading economy in a few minutes.","Despite lower wholesale power prices, off-system sales margin for this segment improved by $0.02 per share. Solid plant operations and lower margin sharing contributed to this result. Other items in total added $0.02 to the earnings for the quarter including lower interest expense and higher AFUDC.","The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.19 per share for the quarter, $0.06 below 2013 results. Regulatory reserves adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.04 per share. A decline in normalized load and higher depreciation expense each impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.01 per share. In addition, other items in total were off $0.02 per share.","On the positive side, rate changes related to new distribution investment in Ohio drove a favorable comparison of $0.02 per share. The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, a $0.05 improvement, reflecting our continued significant capital spending in this area. In the past 12 months, the segment's net plant grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 83%.","The Generation & Marketing segment produced solid earnings of $0.24 per share, adding $0.01 to the quarterly comparison. An improvement in gross margins due to lower fuel costs and favorable hedging was partially offset by higher maintenance expenses. AEP River Operations contributed $0.02 per share more than the 2013 results due to improved barge freight demand.","In summary, despite the effects of mild weather on the quarter, we were still able to shift costs out of future years, and we remain well positioned within the revised guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share.","Let's take a look at Slide 7, where we can review normalized load trends for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, when I made comments about industrial and total load on this slide, my remarks will adjust for the impact of the Ormet load. As you may recall, Ormet, our largest industrial customer at the time, ceased operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. By adjusting for Ormet, you get a sense of how our industrial and total load is recovering in more of a going-forward basis since Ormet is not expected to return to production. In the charts, the numbers are presented with and without the effects of Ormet.","On the bottom right of the slide, you can see that overall, weather-normalized load was up 1.1%. This is being driven by industrial load, which was up 4.8%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter with positive growth in industrial sales. The company experienced growth in 8 of our top 10 sectors for the quarter and 9 of our top 10 for the year. The lone exception for the year is the mining, excluding oil and gas sector, which was down 3%. The quarterly sector leaders are Pipeline Transportation, up 33%; Oil and Gas Extraction, up 11%; Primary Metals, our largest sector, was up 9% for the quarter; and Chemical Manufacturing, our second-largest sector, was up 6%. We will talk more about the shale gas impacts on the economy of AEP service territory later.","On the upper right of the slide, you can see that commercial sales were up 0.002% for the quarter and have experienced positive growth for the last 5 quarters. We feel confident that we will notch a positive annual comparison for the year for the first time since 2008. 5 of our 7 operating companies have experienced normalized commercial sales increases of 1% or greater through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to see growth in the number of the commercial customers.","Finally, in the upper left of the slide, you can see that residential sales were down 1.1% for the quarter. Even though residential sales have been down over the past 2 quarters, they are up year-to-date and are expected to be positive for the year.","Turning to Slide 8. Let's review the recent economic for AEP service territory. Looking at estimated GDP growth for the quarter with recent updates, the economy for the U.S. is now growing faster than AEP's territory at 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively. On the upper-right side of the slide, you can see that economic growth in our western footprint continues to outpace the U.S. and our eastern service area, which trails U.S. growth by 0.006%.","In the bottom-left quadrant, you can see that positive job growth in AEP service area trails that of the U.S. as a whole by 0.004%. Similar to GDP, job growth in AEP's western territories outpaces both the U.S. and AEP's eastern service areas. For AEP, we have experienced strong employment gains in the following sectors: natural resources and mining, construction, leisure and hospitality and manufacturing.","With that segue, let's turn to Slide 9 to see how the U.S. shale gas developments impact AEP's industrial growth. As we've mentioned previously, we are seeing significant industrial load increases in the parts of our service territory that are located in major shale formations. AEP is fortunate to serve at least parts of 5 of the major 7 shale plays in the U.S., which according to the EIA account for over 95% of growth in domestic oil production and 100% of the growth in domestic natural gas production since 2011. For the quarter, industrial shales in the shale counties were up 28% compared to the 1% increase in nonshale counties. Over the past 4 years, we've seen an average increase of 31% over the prior year in our shale counties. This shale region growth is significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale gas counties. The bottom chart shows industrial sales growth by major shale region. In our Eastern footprint, industrial sales are growing fastest in the Utica and Marcellus regions. In our Western footprint, we are growing fastest in the Permian and Woodford regions, while sales are down slightly in the Eagle Ford areas.","Turning to Slide 10. Let's review the financial health of the company. Our debt-to-total capital has continued to improve and now stands at 53.4%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt remain solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 4.9x and 18.5%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding decreased 1% from last quarter and now stands at 99% funded. During the quarter, a modest decrease in plan liabilities from slightly higher interest rates was more than offset by plan asset declines.","Finally, our liquidity stands at about $3 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2016 and 2017. We are currently looking for opportunities to extend these tenors. We've worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on this slide and believe we are well positioned for the future.","Finally, turning to Slide 11. Let me preview some of the detail that we expect -- that we will be sharing with you at the EEI Fall Conference in a few weeks. Last year, we provide detail supporting the company's 4% to 6% operating earnings growth rate off of original 2013 guidance. This year, we will show you how we have been executing on our plan and delivering results that keep us in the ranges we provided you. You should expect an update about investment and growth opportunities available to our Transcos and transmission JVs as well as our regulated wires and integrated utilities companies. We will provide you with an update on the continuous improvement and lean initiatives that we outlined last year. You will recall that O&M discipline was a crucial component of filling the earnings gap presented by declining capacity revenues over the next few years. We will provide updates on our progress on these initiatives.","Last year at EEI, we provided a lot of information designed to offer insight, transparency and credibility to our investment and 4% to 6% growth goals. We plan to update you on those details this year. At this time, we do not have any plans to make strategic announcements at the fall EEI Conference.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first on the line, we have Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can we just talk a little bit more about kind of where O&M stands? Obviously, you've been able to monetize the good first quarter this year, but when you look at the plan and kind of the more lackluster weather this summer, how much O&M do you guys expect to pull forward from '15 and '16 into '14? And how should we think about that affecting kind of '15 and '16 inflation off the '14 numbers?","Nicholas K. Akins","You saw our original plan is -- still is our plan, to move the $60 million that we discussed earlier into '14. So that was pretty much the extent of what we were capable of moving in from those years.","Brian X. Tierney","And Dan, we've completed about 30 of that so far year-to-date, with most of that 30 being in the third quarter. And we anticipate about another 30 in the fourth quarter of this year.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the load growth conversation, you obviously -- the weather-normalized numbers as you show them the slides look pretty good, but the first quarter number still feels a little flaky, shall we say. What do you guys expect for kind of normalized load growth at this point in time? And what do you see swinging that as far as the industrial staying durable, I suppose?","Nicholas K. Akins","Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, so Dan, we anticipate being the end of the year at about 7% -- 0.007% including Ormet and almost 2% if you exclude Ormet for the balance of the year. The thing that you'll notice in the quarterly results, and it's likely to be true in the next few years as well, is a preponderance of that growth is being felt in the industrial side. So when we traditionally think about load growth, we're thinking about it sort of more evenly spread across residential, commercial and industrial and recognizing we make more margin in the residential and commercial side than we do industrial. So while we're pleased in the growth that we're seeing, it's not in the part of the business that is higher margin for us, and we have that forecast going forward in '15 and '16 as well.","Nicholas K. Akins","As a general rule, we -- I guess post-2008, we saw industrials come off, but the financials still held in there because the residential and commercials were late coming off as a result. So as the industrials were consistently going offline, I think it was like 17% reduction post-2008, and then -- but we were able to hold those financials. So now the reverse is sort of happening, where it's great that we're seeing the industrial increases that we're seeing on a consistent basis. But it's going to take time for the residential, and particularly the residential to catch up, because they need sustainability of industrial and commercial load growth for people to actually start relocating and moving out of the house and for the 20-year-olds and that kind of thing. So that's what we're looking for. So that -- it's good that we see the consistency. But, obviously, it's going to be a slow process.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have just one last one, just on the Ohio generation conversation. Obviously, you have this request for late spring next year, but what markers should we be watching from the outside as far as when you think decision points could come up on the interim as to whether you're able to get a PPA done and maybe the sensitivities to what you're willing to do or not do in the negotiation process?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So there's sort of 3 markers there, but I'm not sure how each marker plays into the decision process because the first marker is clearly important. And that is the current ESP filing, the ESP 3 filing that contains the PPA for the OVEC generation, if the commission rejects that, then that's probably a pretty clear indication that the PPA process is pretty much going nowhere. But if they approve that, then there's the potential for subsequent approvals relative to FirstEnergy's request and then ultimately to our request. So that first milestone is critical. And then as we move forward into next year, and I think all of this is going to happen after the governor's election, we'll probably see before the end of the year our ESP 3 case. Hopefully, it will be resolved by the commission. And then subsequent to that, the other 2, including the FirstEnergy request, but our request as well, on the additional generation. So I think it's clearly important. It's important to the industrials, certain industrials. And it's also important from the stability of these resources that are located in Ohio. Right now, Ohio is short capacity, and it's just amazing to me that Ohio would be moving a policy direction that enables generation to be built out of state for import back into the state, particularly with the Utica Shale gas development. But this is where the policy decisions are made with the Ohio Commission. And we need to hear what the thought process is, and we're ready to go based upon whatever that outcome is.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions, one related to Ohio. And I believe with the OVEC filing, I thought the commission had to come up with a decision in, I believe, it was like 270 days. And I know, I think you've exceeded that. Have there been any filings on when a decision is coming out or maybe somebody saying it's past due? And the second question is related to FERC ROEs. And previously, you guys had a -- in one of your chart books, you showed how your ROE was kind of in the middle of the range. And with this downward pressure we've seen in transmission ROEs, does that push you guys more on the higher end and there's a risk that there's going to be downward pressure on your FERC ROE?","Nicholas K. Akins","Okay, so first the Ohio issue. Yes, they're beyond the 270 days. But usually, we don't send past-due notices to the commission. So it's one of those things where I think the commission is going to have to thoughtfully go through this process. And it's a major, I mean, it's a major decision for them relative to the PPA approach. And I'm certainly hopeful that they're thoughtfully considering it and making sure that any order stands up to any type of legal type of challenge. We certainly believe it's legal. And in our filings, we certainly presented a case to that effect. And let's hope they do the right thing. As far as the transmission ROEs, yes, there is downward pressure on transmission ROEs, but they haven't affected us. We certainly have our projects and our TransCo ROEs that are in place. So from an overall sense, we're well within the bandwidth of reasonableness. So from our perspective, we're still in great shape. And I think even in the future, FERC seems to be really careful about ensuring that we continue to encourage transmission investment. And I would expect those ROEs to still encourage that and be the preferable place to put -- for us to put our money.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just quickly a follow-up on Ohio. Do you think the delay -- obviously, you're not going to send a past-due notice. But do you think part of the delay maybe that you're waiting for a decision for the OVEC plan, but then you filed for the incremental plans? Is that causing some of the delay, you think? Or it's just really -- everyone seems really quiet in Ohio with the governor's election. Is it maybe related to that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. I think it's probably the latter of what you said. Because it is separate. It's a separate issue. But the commission has had our ESP filing for a while now. But I think for -- there's a lot of activity obviously around governor's elections in the state -- in any state. And this is a policy decision that needs to be made in a calm environment. And as we look forward to the policy decisions here, it's important for, certainly, the aspect of maintaining generation. But also it raises the question of what does the future mean for Ohio in terms of the building of new capacity within the state. And that probably -- the PPA is somewhat of a Band-Aid approach to maintaining existing generation. But you still have further issues to define within Ohio because clearly they were depending upon the PJM market construct to provide for that -- for capacity to be built, but that's not happening. So there'll be continued evolution of policymaking in Ohio relative to the energy picture.","Operator","Our next question is from Kit Konolige with BGC Partners.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Nick, in your discussion of the unregulated generation business, you discussed that you're, as you've said before, involved in assessing what the optimum approach is to enhance shareholder value. So I'm just wondering if a, you were saying anything different today with regards to timing when you talked about continuing to work in 2015? And b, how much the current proceedings on, at PJM regarding capacity performance and the DR issue and moving the demand curve, how much you want to see those completed or maybe the next auction completed before you go ahead and give us an idea of what you've decided to do with that segment?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So clearly, you're going to see some milestones here. Obviously, the Ohio PPA is one, and then the auction and what happens relative to that certainly will be another. But those are -- all those are particular areas that we're focusing on to enhance the value of our unregulated generation and provide the ability to continue for that business to be a bona fide operation in the future because clearly they need to be able to invest and maintain their facilities in the future. So it's sort of a no-regret strategy around maintaining and enhancing the value of that business. That, to me, is separate from the decision of what that -- what the disposition of that business is in the future. We still maintain that we're a regulated utility. We have to be able to take volatility out of the equation, particularly the capacity market volatility. And it has to be -- it has to look quasi-regulated. Now I don't think the time line of the decision process has changed at all. And we'll still be able to measure that business based upon the lack of volatility and the ability to invest in that business in the future and -- but clearly, we are looking for something that is either regulated, quasi-regulated. But at the end of the day, we will be a regulated utility.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So, I mean, not to press you too hard on this, but is there a way to describe what the timetable could be as you see it now on when you would have enough information about the policy environment to be able to determine whether it was close enough to a regulated that you'd want to retain it or make a decision whether to retain or to divest?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So the question that you started out with was relative to some of the milestones. And those near-term milestones are going to tell you a whole lot. But as far as actually getting into the decision, we are about focusing on infrastructure development, focusing on the development of transmission, focusing on certainly infrastructure that provides for improvement in the customer experience. And to the extent this particular business enables us to use it as a springboard to other focused areas that I just talked about, that's a positive thing. So we will determine the future of that business based upon not only the value it produces from a shareholder perspective but also what our other options are that we've described. So I don't think any -- nothing has changed relative to the process that we're going through. And, obviously, we're looking at the options relative to that business. And we'll continue to do that. 2015, I think in early 2015, particularly with the Ohio decision and the PJM capacity auction, will be particularly instructive. And I think it will probably be a fascinating 2015.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","No doubt, okay. One other separate area. Can you give us a sense of how much -- let me put it this way, how much would the growth rate in load have to decrease before it impacted your earnings growth rate target?","Nicholas K. Akins","Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","Kit, when we put those out a year ago, in the years '14 to '16, overall load was in the negative 0.005% to positive 0.005% range. We're seeing ourselves now clearly above that in year-to-date, but the mix is very much different from what we talked about. So that was the range that we used last year, was the negative 0.005% to positive 0.005%. And we'll be providing an update to that more specifically at EEI in a couple of weeks.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So you're referring to the difference in margin that you get from industrial versus residential?","Brian X. Tierney","Correct.","Operator","Our next question's from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just -- not to beat a dead horse here on the Ohio situation. But with respect to the independent market monitor, there's been some back and forth in the FirstEnergy case. And I noticed that they've intervened in your case. How should we think about the significance of that in terms of your case or how you feel about that?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, I don't think it's completely unexpected. And I think that whenever -- there are going to be challenges based upon the process that we're going through. But the issue remains that SB 221 allows for the Ohio Commission to decide what resources are contained within a PPA approach. And it's very different than the obligation that was placed by legislation in places like Maryland and New Jersey. So a very different approach. And matter of fact -- I mean, you have multiple parties still participating with FRR. They can participate in the PJM market, but they still have regulated operating company requirements relative to generation resources. So it's difficult to make that argument that a FERC-regulated PPA is -- goes against a market construct. So certainly the independent monitor will have his opinion, and everyone else will have their opinions. But we believe we're doing the right thing.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just, Nick, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about kind of hitting your growth rate, but also kind of dealing with growing pains. Could you just talk a little bit more about the growing pains, the regulatory lag and some of the things you mentioned there?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So overall, I'm just trying to make sure that people understand as we go through this process, we're moving -- we're trying to smooth out a huge hole that we had in 2016 and still provide consistent quality earnings and dividend growth for our investors through that period, regardless of what happens. And typically, when you do that -- and your questions like when you -- well, the Mitchell deal, for example. The Mitchell arrangement, the 17.5% that I talked about earlier, it'd have been great to get the whole thing transferred in and be able to recover all of that day 1. But for us, we felt like because we have ins and outs that are occurring throughout that entire cycle, we felt comfortable to go ahead and do that particular settlement, even though the larger benefits for us, and ultimately for the consumer as well, will be when we are able to transfer that other 17.5%, at least the financial side of that 17.5%, into a base rate. So it's those kinds of trade-offs that we're making all the time. And then as we do lean efficiency gains, we're also having to measure those types of things compared to what's going on in relative earnings tests in the various jurisdictions and those types of things. So we have to be -- it's sort of a -- we're pulling multiple levers through this entire process. And some things will go positive. Some things will go negative. But we're very comfortable with where we stand within the guidance range that we've given. And I think we're solidly within that guidance range going forward. So that's the point that I was making. I think there's -- we just don't want to have a lot of irrational exuberance that says that we're adding all the positives and not considering the negatives. This is our job, and this is what we do. And -- but we're very happy with where our guidance range is right now.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, great. Second question is just on the dividend increase you guys announced earlier this week, the 6%.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Could you maybe just give us a little sense on context that within your dividend policy? It is at the high end of your earnings growth range. Is that -- how should we just think about that, the overall dividend policy?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So, Steve, we had a 60% to 70% range that certainly we have espoused earlier for a couple of years now. And the board certainly is committed to that. And we felt like it was time to make a move that not only demonstrated our confidence in the business and the formulation and the guidance that we've given through the period, but also to make sure that we stayed within that 60% to 70%. And I think that it was important for us to make that move. And the context of it was centered around where we see the earnings in the future and where we see this business case developing. And the board felt confident about that approach.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, just how are you feeling about reliability next summer with all the plant shutdowns in your Eastern region? Obviously, a lot of those are your plants. Just how do you feel about reliability?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So -- this is probably a sore subject for me because as we look at the retirements that are occurring in 2015, if we do have a hard, hot summer or even worse, a cold winter in '15, we're going to have serious issues. And I think that -- I think it's going to be a challenge from a reliability perspective. So, hopefully, we'll have a milder summer and a milder winter, but I still believe there's 2 functions here. One is will the system actually operate the way it was intended to operate? And I think it's going to be on the ragged edge of its ability to do that. And then secondly, financially, what will it mean to customers? Because there will be shortages. There will be prices that -- already the Northeast is concerned about deliverability of natural gas because a lot like a pipeline capability, well, the same is true for the electric grid. And there will be areas where prices will be much higher than people anticipated. So I -- the more you take out of this grid, particularly on base load generation that provides 24\/7 support, the more volatile it becomes both operationally and financially. Now I can sit here and say, as a company, from a financial perspective, as long as we operate with excellence, which is what we did during the last polar vortex, we'll be fine financially. But part of our role too is to think about our customers. And while I'm certainly sensitive to 2015 and concerned about 2015, we won't know until we get there.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This may be a Brian question. Brian, you were talking about demand and how industrial demand is really what's driving the year-over-year growth and that the margins on industrial are obviously less than res or commercial. Can you quantify that for us? Like you've given 3-year guidance, roughly on a EPS basis, what's the sensitivity to every 1% change in demand for each of the customer classes?","Brian X. Tierney","I don't have that for you, Michael. We'll be able to have that at the EEI Conference. But I think a 0.5% overall evenly distributed was a $0.05 move EPS annually.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so kind of back of the envelope, if that 0.5% is being driven largely by industrial, you'd kind of think that -- that assumes it's -- the 0.5% is evenly distributed, but what you're seeing isn't necessarily that?","Brian X. Tierney","That's the point we're making.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. One other question, balance sheet. Balance sheet has gotten much healthier, congrats on that, over the last couple of years. When you look forward, do you see a time in the next 2 to 3 years where your balance sheet, kind of heaven forbid, is even too healthy? And how do you define what your long-term goal is for the balance sheet?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. So Michael, we've been getting some of those questions. And I think the idea is what do we do with that balance sheet capacity. And I think you've seen as we have increasingly shifted our spend to the wires side of the business. So you saw before we started 2014, something like 69% of the spend, '14 to '16, was going to wires pieces of our business and increasingly more of that to the transmission side where we had the lowered regulatory lag and the higher ROE. So if you look for us to consume some of that balance sheet capacity that you talked about, I'm inclined to think that you would see that trend continuing. As Lisa and her side of the business in transmission seems to have an insatiable appetite for capital that can return that 11.49% to 11.2% ROE range with very, very little lag. So that's part of the challenge that the management team is working on, is how do we grow the company in the ranges that we've talked about? How do we overcome some of the revenue gaps that Nick talked about associated with capacity? And in addition to growth, how do we continue to reward our shareholders in the form of a dividend? And we need to make sure that we balance all of those shareholder interests equally, and that's what we're struggling with. And that's what we'll provide what I hope are positive updates for investors at the EEI Conference.","Nicholas K. Akins","I think it's an important question, too. We get a lot from an M&A perspective and everything like that. And while obviously the patent answer to any M&A question is we can't talk about it. But we can talk about the way we think about investments and the use of our balance sheet. And, actually, we just look at it as uses and sources. And one source is our healthy balance sheet to be able to invest more in our business. But probably the more important question is what are you investing in? And we want to make absolutely sure that we're investing in those types of investments that will produce the quality returns, the continuity and consistency and the concurrence of a recovery of investment that things like transmission provide. And that's our measure, that's our -- that's our measuring stick. And that's the litmus test for how we invest. So we're well aware of where our balance sheet stands, but we're always looking at credible options for -- to enhance shareholder value.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, one last one. We've seen this in the wireline telecom business this year. There's been a little discussion in the power and utility business as well. Everybody loves to ask the question about what are going to do with the generation business. And I want to ask a little bit of that same question, but really for the transmission business, a high-growth business, high-return business, in terms of do you think that's adequately reflected in the share price? And -- or do you think there are alternative corporate structures that may enable investors to kind of price that in correctly? And how do you go about the process of looking at that?","Nicholas K. Akins","I would say it this way, and Brian can certainly add on to this. But you look at REITs or yield cos and all those types of structures, and there's rewards associated with each one of them, particularly in a business that is central to AEP, and certainly one that we continue to invest in. So I think -- I'd rather see AEP emerge as trading more like a fully regulated and transmission-oriented utility. And that to me is where we're at in the process at this point.","Brian X. Tierney","Michael, we've gotten those questions before, and instead of just saying, \"Oh, we're not going to look at those things,\" we've looked very hard at them with our advisers and tax experts and the like and have come up with the concept that from a REIT standpoint, in particular, we took a really hard look at. A lot of what we've done on the Transco formation is get those Transcos approved at each of the utilities where we operate. And because the REIT would own the transmission assets, we would have to go about and get them certified at each of the states where we do business because they'd be utility asset owners. And then to take advantage of the tax implications of the REIT, we would have to sell a portion of that REIT off. We'd have to spin it because we wouldn't get the tax advantage under a parent environment. And then we'd have to likely come up with some split by which we would share those tax benefits. So the complexities are pretty immense. And we'd want to make sure that the benefits are sustainable and that proposed tax law changes and the like wouldn't make all that hard work and complexity that we'd go to transitory and fleeting. So in the meantime, the REIT is something we've looked very hard at, and it doesn't work for us. And then on a yield co, the size and scale of where we're at doesn't work now as well. So there are structures that we'll continue to look at and look at them hard. But to date, we've found that, as Nick said, keeping those businesses under an AEP umbrella are very beneficial to our shareholders.","Nicholas K. Akins","Michael, I think you can probably appreciate this and some others on the call that we remain focused on answering this unregulated generation question. So that is something that we're focused on at this point. And as far as the timing of transmission, we can continue to invest in transmission, notwithstanding these other structural components. But the clear issue for us is to get on with this unregulated generation decision.","Operator","That'll be from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So perhaps you won't answer this, Brian. But you talked about the growth rate, 4% to 6%. You've obviously been asked about that ad nauseam a bunch of different ways. You're going to give us an update at EEI. But when you gave that, initially you said it was based off a midpoint of $3.05 to $3.25 for '13, which you then -- you gave a guidance range for '14 of $3.20 to $3.40. You updated that to $3.35 to $3.55 after the first quarter. Now you're at $3.40 to $3.50. 2013 seems to me quite a stale base year to be basing a growth rate off of. Should we assume that you're going to give us an update on the growth rate off of '14, or perhaps '15, on what you've earned as a base year? Or how should we think about that?","Brian X. Tierney","So I agree with you, Greg. I think looking back to original guidance for 2013 is getting pretty stale here towards the end of 2014. So we are going to update how we look going forward, what the growth rate looks like. I'm inclined to think we're not going to add another year of specific earnings guidance at the end. We've gone 2014, '15, '16. I don't think we're going to show specific guidance, '17, '18. But we are going to talk about the growth rate at EEI.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like the gross rate isn't going to change demonstrably, but the base year will be refreshed?","Brian X. Tierney","We just need to -- I mean, I don't want to be here in 2015 talking about original guidance for 2013. So we need to get off that and start talking about more what we look like going forward. And we'll be able to do that in a credible way at EEI.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Okay. Thank you for joining us on today's call.

Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Lea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate your taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call.

Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's first quarter 2018 earnings call. We were very happy to get out of 2017 in a respectable fashion with one of the mildest years on record, but still delivering results within our guidance range for the year. We're off to a much more normal start in 2018 financially with more normal weather buoyed by what appears to be a resurgent economy. In fact, AEP service territory economy and load performance is as strong as it has been in years.","Unemployment rates are the lowest since 2000 and retail sales are up in all classes, all companies, and actually in all 10 sectors of the economy, which hasn't happened since 2011.","With that said, because of O&M timing and this return to normal levels after a year of reductions due to weather, our results for the quarter were on par with expectations in achieving our stated guidance range for the year of $3.75 to $3.95 per share, which we are reaffirming.","The first quarter 2018 EPS came in at $0.92 per share GAAP and $0.96 per share operating versus a $1.20 per share GAAP and $0.96 per share operating respectively in 2017. So, overall, a good quarter and start for the year. Looking deeper into the quarter, and Brian will cover this in more detail, fundamentally, we are in better shape than in the first quarter of last year given this has been a busy quarter of rate case outcomes that set the tone for the future.","I'll get into the rate case outcomes in a minute, but first I want to say thank you to our employees who worked so hard in the recovery efforts after last year's hurricanes; hurricanes Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida, and Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico. Our last employees have returned from Puerto Rico and I'm so proud of their accomplishments in very severe conditions. In our business, they are our heroes.","Now, let's talk about some activities of interest here in this quarter. Wind Catcher is finally feeling some tailwinds. We have accomplished important settlements in Arkansas, Louisiana, and now Oklahoma with the industrials and Walmart that provides the framework for the various commissions to bless this significant project and its benefits for our customers.","We are continuing to try to bring other parties in Oklahoma, such as the Oklahoma staff on the settlement agreement and are continuing our efforts in Texas to achieve a settlement as well. We have taken on manageable risk intended to recognize market expectations relative to regulated wind projects and have worked hard to mitigate these risks in the background with engineering, construction, and operational strategies. We are confident in our ability to deliver the expected benefits to our customers and shareholders and look forward to obtaining Commission approvals so that we can move forward as quickly as possible. We are now awaiting Commission orders in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas and expecting orders in the May and June timeframe.","Regarding Ohio, we just received an order yesterday. We're pleased that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved the settlement for the most part in the Ohio ESP case. Not only do we now have an ESP that is effective through 2024, which certainly brings an important element of stability, it also preserves the continuation of the Distribution Investment Rider at the settlement agreement level and a 10% ROE.","The order also supports future opportunities through the smart city initiative and the Renewable Generation Rider. These components really look to the future as a vision by Chairman, Asim Haque's PowerForward initiative.","AEP stands ready to support the PUCO in this important endeavor. Additionally, the Columbus Smart City initiative has taken a major step forward in providing societal benefits of electrification, EV adoption, distributed resources, smart street lighting and other benefits that will define the future for Columbus and the nation.","This order also preserves our ability to collect for OVEC subject to certain transmission-related limitations through 2024. All in all, a good order, brings stability and certainty to future benefits that will support AEP's drive to improve the customer experience.","Several other rate case outcomes have produced positive results. In Indiana, I&M has a settlement agreement filed and we anticipate a July effective date of a net revenue increase of $97 million, which includes tax reform adjustments and 9.95% approved ROE.","In Michigan, in order effective this month with a revenue increase of $49 million and a 9.9% authorized ROE has been completed. In Kentucky, a 9.7% authorized ROE and a net revenue of $16 million, adjusted for tax reform, was effective in January of this quarter.","SWEPCO Texas increased \u2013 their increase of $50 million and 9.6% ROE that was approved and retroactively applied to May of last year. In Oklahoma, which is our only significant rate case disappointment with only a 9.3% authorized ROE and $76 million net revenue adjusted for tax reform was effective in March.","And speaking of tax reform, the adjustment for tax reform in the Oklahoma case assumed that the authorized ROE versus the actual ROE of 5.2%, that cost PSO another $15 million. So, we have some work to do to try to clarify some of that activity. Brian will be discussing tax reform itself in more detail in a couple of minutes.","Because PSO's effective ROE is only 5.2% we're evaluating our options regarding cost control and additional rate case activity. Regarding the FERC 206 transmission cases, in the East, we filed with FERC a settlement with several of the parties that resolves all issues set for hearing.","The settlement agreed to have base ROE of 9.8% subject to a cap and common equity of 55%. With the RTO adder of 50 basis points, the effective ROE will be 10.3% and we will adjust our 50\/50 cash structure to reflect the 55% equity layer.","Interim rate changes reflecting these settlement parameters were filed with for PJM earlier this month. We await a final order from FERC as we bring certainty to our transmission-related investments in the East. Where AEP has much less exposure in the West, settlement discussions have stalled. We stand ready for further discussions, but this may likely go to hearing for a resolution to occur.","So as you move to the equalizer chart this time around, many of these many of these companies we've already covered so this will be a sort of a shorter version. But overall, our regulated ROEs are 9.5%, which it was 9.5% last quarter. We generally target the 10% range. And as you know, we have currently five rate cases that are completed. So, we expect these ROEs to continue to improve across the board.","Regarding AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the first quarter was 13.7%, but that includes issues that are actually excluded for evaluation of the SEET. And also, the SEET-adjusted ROE is 9.5%. As you recall, they have some legacy issues that are excluded from the calculation such as the RSR, some fuel-related activities, and 2014 SEET refund. So, the effective return is 9.5%. And those legacy items generally roll off at the end of the year. So, hopefully, we'll be able to merge those two bubbles into something that makes sense later on.","APCo, APCo at the end of the first quarter was 9.2%. APCo's improvement in ROE over the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily weather. Just a note, the Virginia Legislature passed legislation establishing triennial rate reviews, and APCo's first triennial review will be in 2020 and will cover the 2017 to 2019 period. So, we have a little work to do there. And then West Virginia, we intend on following a rate case in May in that jurisdiction.","I already covered Kentucky, but just wanted to mention to you that we do have a couple of large aluminum company and a battery storage manufacturer located there, and that's part of our long-term strategy around improvements in the ROEs in Kentucky. Certainly, the economic development part of that is very important.","As far as I&M, I already covered both of those. PSO, I think we've talked about enough. SWEPCO continues to have the effect of not only the Turk 88 megawatts, which we'll have to deal with in the future, but also they lost some wholesale contract load that went off at the first of the year. So, that was an impact for them. But we expect them to move up just a little bit as form of (10:16) base rates and other mechanisms come into place in the retail jurisdictions.","AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter 2018 was 10.1% versus 10% last quarter. AEP Texas, their steady ROE is primarily attributable to favorable regulatory treatment in Texas with the ability to file an annual DCRF and TCOS filings. AEP Transmission Holdco continues to do well. At the end of the first quarter, it was 12.9% and it's slightly better than the fourth quarter due to benefits from tax reform and some timing matters. So, generally, while it looks like there's a trough there, we fully expect that to continue to improve with the rate case outcomes that we've put in place.","So, this has been a normal quarter financially, but an outstanding quarter overall from an execution standpoint that sets the tone for 2018 and beyond with several rate case outcomes and settlements regarding Wind Catcher behind us, as Rush's classic rock song, Red Barchetta, which \u2013 Red Barchetta is a car, it's a two-seater Italian car \u2013 would say it's time to strip away the old debris, fire up the shiny Red Barchetta and respond with a roar. That's what I see in the excitement, the energy of our teams of employees at this company working on projects such as Wind Catcher and other technology advancements that will change the face of AEP's interaction with our customers.","To paraphrase one of the latest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, Bon Jovi, and I know this phrase will stick with you the rest of the day, we're halfway there, living on a prayer, take our hand and we'll make it, we swear. So, enjoy the ride with American Electric Power. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and finish with an update on tax reform.","Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were $0.96 per share or $473 million, comparable to last year's results. All of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter. And as expected, our competitive Generation & Marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales.","Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the Vertically-Integrated Utilities were $0.47 per share, up $0.02. Most of the $0.12 increase in weather was driven by the warm 2017 winter. Rate changes were also favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions. Offsetting these favorable items were anticipated decreases in our wholesale load as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses.","The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share, up a penny from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized load, weather and rate changes, each contributing a penny. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher O&M and depreciation expenses.","The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.21 per share, an improvement of $0.07 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base as well as other items, including a true-up for the FERC 206 settlement and other small non-recurring items. Our investment in this segment grew by $1.7 billion since last March.","Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.08 per share, down $0.06 from last year, primarily due to the sale of assets. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share from last year due to higher interest and O&M expenses and a prior-year investment gain. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance.","Now, let's turn to slide 7 for an update on normalized load growth. Starting in the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 1.5%, which is similar to last quarter. For the first time since 2011, we experienced normalized load growth across all three major retail classes.","Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 2.5% for the quarter. Each of our top 10 industrial sectors reported growth versus last year for the first time in years. Sectors that posted the strongest growth this quarter were pipeline transportation, oil and gas extraction and primary metals. The impact of tax reform, higher energy prices and a stronger global economy, as well as a weaker dollar, have all combined to create a positive environment for industrial sales.","In the upper-left chart, normalized residential sales were up 1.4% for the quarter. The chart shows improvement in residential sales over the past year. The growth is spread across both the Vertically-Integrated and T&D Utilities segments. Customer accounts were up 0.5% compared to last year, which is the strongest we've seen since 2015. Weather-normalized usage was also up 0.9% this quarter, and has correlated with the recent improvement in incomes, which I'll discuss in more detail on the next slide.","Finally, in the upper-right chart, commercial sales for the quarter increased by 0.5%. This is the first time since 2016 that our commercial class reported growth, which was largely concentrated in Ohio and our Western service territory. We continue to expect modest gains in commercial sales in 2018.","Now, let's move to slide 8 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper-left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U.S. by 0.4% in the first quarter. In fact, the economy in AEP service territory has been growing at a faster pace than the U.S. for the past year. The upper-right chart shows that employment growth in AEP service territory continues to close in on that of the U.S.","For the quarter, job growth in AEP service territory was at 1.1% with higher growth in our Western territory than our Eastern. And while employment growth has continued to improve, unemployment rates in our footprint are at their lowest level since 2000. The bottom chart on this page shows growth in personal income. In the first quarter, income growth within AEP service area was 0.7% greater than the U.S. Rising customer incomes was a key driver for the increase in residential sales.","Now, let's move to slide 9 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased 1.1% during the quarter to 56.6%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 18.2% and our net liquidity stood at about $1.3 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding improved to 102% and our OPEB funding improved to 131%. For both plans, the funded status improved due to rising interest rates, driving a decrease in liabilities that more than offset asset losses.","Let's turn to slide 10, and I will update the tax reform information that I provided earlier in the year. In regards to the change in the statutory corporate rate, we either have regulatory orders in place or filed settlements to reflect a lower rate in Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and FERC Transmission for our Eastern states. In our remaining regulated jurisdictions, we are deferring the difference between the old and new rate for future adjustment. Trackers and formula rate filings will accommodate this change in Louisiana, AEP Texas and Ohio.","We have updated the slide to show that as of March 31, we have approximately $1 billion of excess deferred income tax, which is not associated with depreciable assets and will flow back to customers at a tenor set by each jurisdiction.","Options for passing this benefit to customers include decreasing rates for some period of time, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation and offsetting items that would otherwise increase rates. We have addressed this issue in our Indiana and East FERC Transmission settlements and are working with our remaining jurisdictions to determine the best resolution.","As we discussed in January, we reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $500 million to support our FFO to debt ratio, and we reiterated our equity plans which we anticipate raising $100 million in 2018 and 2019 and $500 million in 2020. As a reminder, this plan does not include provisions for Wind Catcher. In addition to this slide, there is more detail on slide 23 of the presentation.","Let's try and wrap this up on slide 11 so we can get to your questions. We will finalize our pending rate cases, obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project, and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution for customers regarding tax reform. Our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Several questions for you. I'll try to make them brief. First is congrats on the Wind Catcher settlement in Oklahoma. You have a couple parties on board, but you have many more that have not officially signed on. But can you give us some color around the negotiations there? And what, on the margin, you have conceded to give up in this settlement to give customer protections versus the prior deal? And what it might take to get more parties on board?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, Greg. Obviously, a great question. We continue to try to get other parties on board. But as we said from the beginning, it was extremely important to get the industrials on board in Oklahoma. And I think by getting them on board, it certainly sets the predicate for the opportunity for the commissioners themselves to look at this and say, okay, we've got both the industrial customers and Walmart, and the customers have spoken.","Now, there are other parties, as you mentioned. And certainly, we're trying to get the Oklahoma staff engaged in this process and, certainly, the Attorney General \u2013 probably not likely to get the Attorney General on board. But others will continue to be open to that, including the Attorney General.","But at this point, though, I think it's framed up pretty well, because a lot of work's been done in the background. Our people have been working tirelessly with all these parties around the various jurisdictions to try to drive some consistency around what the risks were being taken. And a lot of it centered on the 10-year look-backs, the performance guarantees, certainly the force majeure-related provisions as well.","And it really \u2013 as we looked at it, and as I mentioned early on in our discussion, you have to \u2013 if you're going to do regulated renewables, then certainly we'll have to meet the market on what risks are being taken relative to regulated renewable investments. And we looked at it, looked at it in a lot of detail. We have a lot of, like \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, engineering and construction. We looked that in detail, the operational characteristics of particularly the generation tie (22:16), and we've come a long way in terms of the evaluation of those risks.","We were willing to take it, and the industrials were ultimately supportive. So, I think it just sets the tone for continued discussions. But as far as I'm concerned, we've put it in a very good place, and you'll note that those provisions are pretty consistent with the settlements that have been done previously by SPS over in New Mexico and Texas. And we're having discussions with the Texas parties now. So, you're starting to see, in my opinion, a coalition around what risk parameters, what the framework of a deal looks like, and I see that momentum gaining.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Well. Good luck with that. I think that's great. Two more questions. One is on when you look at the equalizer chart, in Oklahoma, I know PSO on a trailing 12 only earned 5.2% and the rate decision you've got there wasn't great, but it was better than the skinny deals that Oklahoma traditionally gives. So if we were to extrapolate out 12 months, we would still expect PSO's ROEs to improve dramatically, maybe if not towards your best case aspiration. Is that fair?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Well, the odd part about it is, if Wind Catcher gets approved, ultimately it's going to help the ROE overall because PSO has a really small rate base. I mean, essentially, no generation's been built there for quite a period of time. So you're really dealing with a large company that \u2013 with a lot of PPAs for generation. So, the rate base itself has dwindled to really pretty small. I mean it's less than 5% of the earnings of the corporation. And so, when you think about where PSO is heading, if Oklahoma really wants to develop infrastructure around these types of assets, energy assets, to take advantage of wind power, natural gas, certainly indigenous sources for that territory, we're going to have to see positive signals on those types of investments.","And they really do need to fix the issue of recovering transmission cost as well on a timely basis. So, a lot of this rate lag type of activity, it took a long time for the last rate case and actually the rate case pretty much turned out to be very disappointing. I was really expecting more from the Oklahoma Commission from that perspective, but I think there were a lot of issues that were being dealt with there that, hopefully, next time we'll be able to get over and we will be following another rate case in Oklahoma. But certainly, the Wind Catcher approval is what we have our sights on right now.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And my last question is on page 9, we look at the credit statistics, obviously, on a trailing basis here at 18.2% FFO. But tax reform really hadn't kicked in yet, and I know you said the target is the mid-teens. But all things being equal, if we look out 12 months, how much of a degradation in that FFO are we looking at? Is it a couple of hundred basis points?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Brian.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We think it'll be 200 basis points to 300 basis points, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. Sure thing.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","So, speaking of living on a prayer, I have a few Wind Catcher question. Sorry. I couldn't help. You asked for that one.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","(26:31).","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Thank you for the Rush references, those are great. So just if I recall back last fall, you had talked about wanting decisions by April to make sure that you would have it online to get the full PTCs.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Is May-June going to be okay to be able to capture full PTCs? Like, what is the real deadline?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, we'll be fine. Really, we have to get to a point of getting these orders in place, and then we'll cover it with our board, obviously, in our July meeting. And then once they approve it, we're off and running. So if we get it in that June timeframe, we get the orders in the May to June timeframe, we'll be in good shape.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just you're appropriately very focused on making sure you're not taking on risks that are not typical for regulated investment. Could you \u2013 and I know you just did this, but just when you look at the main risks that you're kind of protecting from, could you just clarify what those are?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think certainly the 10-year look-back, because obviously the customers want to see a benefit, and we're convinced there will be a benefit. Now, that goes to the operations of the facilities. But the 10-year look-back obviously measures the benefits that customers see, and that analysis is based upon our existing generation. So, we feel pretty good about how that would work out. And then when you look at the force majeure provisions, those are really focused on \u2013 and you have to look at sort of the force majeure risk compared to the production guarantees, and the production guarantees are such that we really \u2013 and we looked at this operational from an engineering standpoint, and we feel like that there is risk mitigation associated with the production guarantees that enable us to take on more risk as it relates to force majeure.","And then, obviously, that goes to the production guarantee, the capacity factor guarantee, and we feel very comfortable about that as well, because we've been in that territory for a long time. We know how to build transmission. We know how to run transmission. If a tornado came through, it could take down a couple of structures or whatever, but we're used to doing that, and we know the timeframe of doing that. And then for the facilities themselves, obviously, there's a multitude of \u2013 yeah, it really is pretty good from a diversity of standpoint. It's not like a central station generation facilities. It's a bunch of small generators sitting up on poles. And that really gives us an opportunity to mitigate risk on an aggregate standpoint from that perspective as well.","So when we look at it, we are convinced that we're able to deliver the production guarantees, but also have the ability to adjust, if necessary. So, all in all, I'd say, the rewards at this point certainly outweigh the risks.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. The first question. I think, Brian, you mentioned that you had addressed the excess deferred tax in the Indiana and FERC East settlements. How much of the billion dollars does that speak to?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hold on a second, Greg (sic) [Jon] (30:50). About $100.25 million.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Jon.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And then I think you've given some guidance in the past as what timeframe you thought was a reasonable rule of thumb for this or what you'd seen in the 1986 case, any updated thoughts around that.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think if you assume 10 years, you'll probably be at about the right place.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then just on sales, Brian, I may have missed this. At one point, I think you said you were going to have a little additional commentary on the residential piece and the 1.4% in the first quarter, obviously, is bucking the trend. Do you have some follow-up comment on that, was weather normalization kind of tricky this quarter?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No, I think that's pretty much on track. The places where we're seeing it, though, Greg, is in the places where we're just T&D Utilities, so we're seeing it more in Texas and Ohio. And that's why you're not seeing as much uplift in revenue is because it's just in the places where we are wires only. It's mostly in the places where we're wires only so. So while we're encouraged by this given where it's coming from and the mix of those sales, we're not getting a huge amount of uplift in regards to net income because of that residential increase.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, perhaps, to turn the attention slightly differently here. I understand that you received your order in Ohio and you've got the ESP under control and out there. But to what ability is there to negotiate and address the tax issue still or is there a need to at this point? I just wanted to kind of come back to that. It seems like you largely addressed the issues there, but I just want to kind of come back to that given there's not an obvious venue to address that directly notwithstanding reopening these issues. So, I just want to understand.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Specifically, Ohio?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. He's talking about Ohio.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Exactly.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, we have two avenues for addressing that. One is just the absolute change in rate which I think we can handle in DIR filings. But then also what the Commission has done is asked us as well as the other AEP utilities \u2013 the other Ohio utilities to come in and have a dialog with them about that. So, they've set up a hearing mechanism whereby all of the Ohio utilities will go in and have the dialog. And I think we'll be able to put together something that is compelling, and doesn't have to be litigious. I think we'll be able to settle that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Excellent. And then turning back to Wind Catcher real quickly, obviously, you're working every state front. To the extent to which, let's say, Texas and those negotiations aren't necessarily as fruitful here on the prescribed timeline that you just talked about, how confident are you about signing up alternatives like munis and co-ops just to be able to continue working on the project, notwithstanding clarity in Texas, shall we say?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Julien, I really think we are going to get a result in Texas. And I think it'd be problematic during the pendency of something that's working to go sell somewhere else. So, we're feeling pretty good about the direction this all is taking and the timing of it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And maybe actually if you could clarify, I would suspect that the issues, they're largely the same as you just described a moment ago across the various states. Is there anything unique with respect to Texas? Obviously, the industrial interveners there have historically been fairly outspoken as well.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No, I think as far as Texas is concerned, I mean the industrials in Texas, you have some of the people who represent the same people, but I think you've got certainly different industrials with different thought processes. But when you think about the settlement that was done with SPS and how it compares against what, certainly what we've done relative to the Oklahoma industrials, it's pretty much the same. And SPS settled with all the parties in Texas. So I think we have an opportunity. We knew going into this thing that with four states, there'd be some commonality in that. In fact, the four states have, in most cases, most favored nations and that kind of thing. So, they're all watching each other in terms of the result. And we have a result in Oklahoma and in the other jurisdictions there that is consistent with what is happening in Texas at this point. And I think we're in good shape.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Excellent. Well, best of luck.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to a line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Paul. Yes, I can hear you.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Two questions. Is there a statutory deadline in any of the Wind Catcher states, when this has to be done by?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","I don't think there's a statutory deadline, but certainly there's a business deadline. I mean, we've been very transparent about the timing necessary and the procedural schedules have been set up consistent with getting a decision on time. So, I think it's really more driven by, I guess, one of the previous questions sort of brought out, when is our drop-dead date and that kind of thing. But I can just tell you that May and June fits.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then some of the concessions you've made are around cost caps. Who's wearing that risk? Is it you or the contractors?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's both. We have fixed-price contracts with the appropriate contingencies. And I think that that risk is being shared. And actually, this tells you a little bit about the commitment of the suppliers that we're working with. I mean, these are established suppliers that do a lot of business that we do a lot of business with. And I can guarantee a lot of homework's been done on what these operational provisions will look like, what the construction side will look like, what the supply will look like, what risks are being borne. And also even if route changes were to occur on the generation tie (38:02) that those have been discussed and (38:05) as well. So, we feel very good about where our suppliers sit at this point.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","We're not building nuclear plants here, right?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We're not building nuclear plants. Well, I wouldn't want to trash nuclear or anything, because I'm supportive of nuclear. But this is putting small generators up on poles and putting transmission structures up and lines up, and we do that all the time. And 765, we do that all the time. And so, this is not something that is a first \u2013 like stamp number one. And the other thing, too, is that when we look at this entire project, it is definitely important to AEP because it represents what we're capable of doing. And when you introduce 765-kV in that part of the country, it could be a tremendous benefit in the future, not just from an economic development standpoint, but also in terms of our ability to continue to serve our customers and serve them well.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Then one last question, and if you addressed this, I'll circle back with Bette Jo. But transmission was very strong in the quarter. What was driving that?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, there were some \u2013 there was obviously the FERC 206 settlement was a contributor to that. But tax reform also contributed to that in that the rate base goes up higher with the ADIT not going into rates. So, those two factors mainly contributed to that increase.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is this kind of \u2013 did all of this hit in the first quarter, or are we going to continue to see those, at least on the tax reform, flow through the year?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We expect an uplift of about $0.04 versus what we'd shown you at EEI over the course of the whole year, $0.04 to $0.05.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Sure thing, Paul.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citi. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Praful. How are you doing?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. How are you?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Just fine.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Excellent. So, quickly just on the deferred income taxes, on the unprotected one, I think, Brian, you mentioned 10 years as a possible assumption for refund. We've also heard from other utilities who are paying it back a lot sooner. So just want to understand, is that mostly an assumption of a negotiation or is that a preference from your end to kind of draw it out over a longer period because there are benefits to kind of growing rate base as you kind of refund it back as well?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So, you're going to see everything from much quicker than that to much slower than that across our 11 jurisdictions. And so, the data point that I have is what we were able to do in Indiana where we were able to increase the depreciation on some of our coal units there and have that be the factor by which we flow back the excess, and that was a 10-year period. So if you're modeling something across the system, I think 10 years would be a pretty good assumption.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And your preference is not to do it sooner as well, just to understand from a preference perspective?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Our preference really is kind of do it on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, right? And when we talk about taking down reg assets, when we talk about fuel, when we talk about other things that are going to increase rates, it's really going to be jurisdiction by jurisdiction as to what the best way for those customers is for them to receive that benefit. And we're going to work with interveners and commissions and try and be as constructive as we possibly can on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then just quickly, just strategically, more from a corporate M&A perspective, the conversation has increased a little bit given tax reforms behind. And it also looks like companies who are better positioned, like yourselves with stronger credit going into tax reform have a competitive advantage. Do you see that at all? Do you see any dialog increasing, and how are you looking at strategic M&A at this point?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, let me just address the financial aspect of it, and I'll Nick address the strategic aspect of it. So when we're looking at our balance sheet, you look at our credit metrics and they are very healthy now. We do expect them to go back into the normal range for Baa1 rated company due to the impact of tax reform. So, we're very strong right now. We had anticipated being a tax payer. That's gone away, to a large degree, with the impact of tax reform, Wind Catcher and other such things. But because of the impacts of tax reform, we do anticipate, as we talked about earlier in the call in the question-and-answer period, that FFO to debt to come in 200 basis points to 300 basis points over the next year or so. So, we anticipate consuming that cushion that you might see there otherwise. And I'll let Nick comment on the strategic component.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, we are in the middle of what I would call an M&A transaction without a premium. It's called the Wind Catcher. And so when we look at the strength of the balance sheet, certainly we'll be looking at the financing needs for Wind Catcher and that's a $4.5 billion transaction. So, that's where our thoughts are at this point.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks so much, guys, appreciate it.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Nick, to clarify, as you're looking at the four states for approval in Wind Catcher, is it fair to say just given where we are that Oklahoma probably is the most challenged of the four? And related to that, could you theoretically complete the project if the other three states say yes and Oklahoma was to say no?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So, on the first point, I would agree with you. Oklahoma has been the most challenging. And really, with the ALJ order there, it made even more of a challenge for the commissioners to really take a look at it from a positive standpoint. But I really believe they will at the end of the day and \u2013 because they obviously look at much broader issues. And so, with that said, I think as far as Wind Catcher is concerned, we intend on this project being for those four states and certainly the FERC customers. There's some FERC customers too that are involved. And if one were to fall out, we're really \u2013 as I said, I mean, I think we're at a good place in terms of the transition of getting this thing across the finish line. And at this point, we really aren't entertaining the notion of going forward with the project without one of the jurisdictions. I really don't see that happening.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Second question, Brian, wanted to clarify if I heard you right, you were mentioning that when you're looking at your transmission earnings for 2018, you're now thinking they will come in about $0.04 to $0.05 better than what you had indicated to us back at EEI. Is there anything offsetting that? Or in the context of the year, should we see that as a positive cushion that may, if things play out, cause you to move to the right or above your midpoint of your range?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's a good question, Ali. It's really early in the year. And in a company as big as ours, we're going to have pluses and minuses across the year as things go on. So, we wouldn't anticipate any change at this point to what our guidance is. That's just one area that is up versus what we had anticipated. There are others that are down, and we'll lay those out to you as we go through the year on a quarterly basis.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And last question, can you also remind us relative to the rate increase that you had assumed in your 2018 guidance, how much of that is currently locked in?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, we have about 75% of it's currently locked in.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","75%. Got it. Thank you.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Okay.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Ali.","Operator","Next, we go to a line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Just fine.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just sort of quickly follow up here on Wind Catcher. Why is it that the \u2013 what are the key issues, I guess, sort of maybe stopping the OCC staff and others from coming on board?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Your guess is as good as mine. I think, obviously, the ALJ looked at it from a procedural basis it seemed like to me. But we're pretty convinced we did file under the right provisions under Oklahoma law. But obviously, we'll continue with discussions with certainly the Oklahoma staff. And I think \u2013 I really do believe we put provisions in place with the industrials that should benefit that discussion with them. Obviously, to have that kind of company of the customers certainly would help from a policy side and from a staff side to really take a hard look at this. So, the verdict's still out on that and we'll continue those discussions.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, in Oklahoma, there's this tax issue on Wind. I guess we expect it's intertwined with school funding and there was something that passed the House yesterday. And I was just wondering how would that work with respect to the settlement or with respect to the project, or does it have any impact. Can you give us sort of a sense about that?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Well, it won't have any impact on the project. And it got poured out of the legislature yesterday. So, we don't see that happening.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I mean, I thought it passed the House is what I just saw.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","The provision for the tax credit, I thought it was removed. But we can talk about it later. But what you're saying is you don't see any activity on that whatsoever, is what you're...?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So if something like that did happen, though, since it's been sort of debated and what have you, and the school funding issue, in terms of the settlement, how would that \u2013 would that be something that you guys would absorb or would that be something that \u2013 how would that be treated if there was subsequently some sort of impact on wind generation in Oklahoma as a result of something that the state legislature may or may not do in the future?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So, there is that risk, but not likely. And the state tax credit wasn't assumed in the Wind Catcher economics, to begin with. So if something were to occur, it wouldn't have any effect.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, I got you. Okay. I think maybe that's what was in there. Maybe that's what I'm confused about.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And that's it. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much, Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Sure thing, Paul.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Christopher.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the potential for grid modernization spend in Ohio. Previously, I think you've talked about $500 million of incremental potential versus your current plan if you get the green light there. But the Commission has been going through exploring the process generically for the whole state and I'm curious to hear your thoughts.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So, the $500 million was for the entire system, because you know when we presented that EEI. If we were able to get \u2013 move forward with grid modernization in those jurisdictions, there was an incremental $500 million. Certainly, Ohio, the order sort of sets up the tone to really have that discussion because the more we move in the technological front and the more we move into optimization efficiencies around the grid, we'll be able to have those kinds of discussions. And I think yesterday's order of the Ohio Commission was the first step in that process. And I think it bodes well for Ohio and, certainly, we'll use that pattern in the rest of our system as well.","So right now, there's nothing incremental on the $500 million. That was a Distribution Investment Rider and those kinds of things. Those issues were already in place. So, we'll obviously continue to have that dialog.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, you mentioned I think towards 2018 year-end the gap between the SEET earnings test in Ohio and the actual earned ROE calculation narrowing. Can you quantify potentially the impact on earnings that that alone would have in 2019?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Brian.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, we anticipate it ultimately being around 10% and that's factored into what it is we've guided you to. There's no incremental change to that.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Sure.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, Nick. Thank you for taking my questions.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Looking at the cash flow sides in the appendix, the three-year forecast, and this isn't new information. But just curious, you all talk about needing more equity in 2020, but your cash flow actually gets a lot better in 2020, I mean, by like $1 billion if you just use cash from ops minus cash from investing activities. Are you being overly conservative when thinking about 2020? Is the equity really something that might need to come a little bit earlier? It's not a big amount, but like you're pretty cash negative for the next two years and then it gets a lot better. Or is this all just kind of prepping for Wind Catcher?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","What you see on slide 25 really doesn't include Wind Catcher. And what we're looking at is what happens to our FFO to debt over time and trying to time, like you've seen others do, any equity needs with when they're actually needed and not take the dilutive effect of that sooner than we need to. So, we are going to let our FFO to debt metric deteriorate maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points, get down into that Baa1 range. And we anticipate needing to bolster that a little bit, but not before the 2020 timeframe.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And can I ask, what's in that slide? What's your assumption in there for the return of the excess ADFIT, the billion dollars? And the only reason I asked that is one of your neighbors in Louisiana and Arkansas is under a much faster \u2013 and I think one of my colleagues asked this earlier, but their timeline for returning the excess ADIFT is actually a really quick one, like one to three years. I'm just trying to think about what you've assumed or embedded in your guidance on cash flow for that.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Just assume 7 to 10 years.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So if it's quicker than that of the return of the excess ADFIT, that would negatively weigh on cash and might either bring forward the equity need or raise the equity need?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","It's a change in cash flows.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Finally, Nick, just kind of you mentioned about the West Virginia rate case filing. How are you thinking about what structural changes in West Virginia you might ask for, and whether you do it in the case filing or whether you do it in some legislative effort? Just it's a state with traditional historical test years, little bit of lag. Just trying to think about how you're thinking big picture there.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. We haven't supposed any structural changes in West Virginia. And I think, probably, all that West Virginia has been through and going through now from an economic standpoint, we really are focused on ensuring that our rate cases are filed very efficient. They certainly are focused on making sure that we're doing the right things by what we believe in terms of service quality to our customers in West Virginia. I think we probably ought to stick to that approach in West Virginia for the time being. And so, we haven't presupposed any structural changes.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And when we think about the next seven or eight months, eight or nine months in 2018, how are you thinking about where else kind of sizable general rate case filings may occur?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Well, really, the only ones would be West Virginia and Oklahoma. Everything else has really flushed itself out this quarter. And so, we're pretty clean going forward from a regulatory standpoint.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","And of course, Mike, we'll have our usual formula (57:01) base rate filings in places like transmission and Ohio and other places.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","I would say, on your previous question too, we had Virginia recently in the quarter, they also dismissed a case that would have been for two wind power projects. And so, as Virginia thinks differently than West Virginia, the more we see that from a supply perspective, that's going to be an important data point for us as we go in for these cases, how to deal with that. And so, that would probably be the extent of the \u2013 your structural question just brought up that issue in my mind of how resources are being seen differently in the two jurisdictions and of APCo, and we'll have to try to drive some consistency there.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Brian. Much appreciate it, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","And operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Very good. It's the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. So, I surprising, had a question about Wind Catcher. So, we've seen a number of renegotiations of wind equipment contracts by utilities, by different developers and OEMs \u2013 with OEMs, seemed willing. So, now that you have these caps on the cost of the projects and then you have the performance guarantees, couldn't you just go back to GE and say, okay, well, this is the reality we're facing, as such we need to actually get a cut on the equipment cost and also maybe you can provide us with a performance guarantee for the wind turbine.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. Brian.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, Angie, whether it's Invenergy, GE or Quanta, all of our partners have skin in the game on this and they are being very proactive in how they're helping us manage the risk of things like caps relative to the cost of equipment, relative to tax impacts they might have, relative to other increases and decreases in their costs. And it's very much of a partnership rather than a traditional supplier relationship. So, they are working very proactively with us on all those issues.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. So, basically, the true risk is more on the timing of the construction of the transmission line. I mean if all of the other factors are really, in a sense, mitigated right, the cost of construction of the wind farm, the operating more NCF (59:54) of the wind farms, it's really the transmission line that is more of a risky part of the project?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","It's all the things that you would think in a project. It's cost and schedule. And so, we have some of the cost mitigated through the partnerships that we have with our suppliers and they're also helping us to mitigate the schedule component of it as well. So, it's what you would expect in a project of this size and scope. We need to bring it in at cost, on budget, and on schedule, and we have experienced partners who are working with us to help us do that.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","And we've mitigated pieces of the risk too, because we're acquiring the plant at commercial operation. So, Invenergy is obviously doing their work associated with that. It's been well thought out. Going to your earlier point though, we obviously are paying particular attention to the generation interconnection or you call it transmission, that piece of it to ensure, from a supplier perspective, we're in good shape. We've had conversations with certainly their executive leadership about the importance of the arrangement we have in place. And I think in terms of routing, that work continues in earnest and alternatives are considered in earnest. So when you look at the construction side and the risk being taken, we're in really good shape.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the last question is \u2013 so you mentioned that now under the new tax regime, you won't be paying taxes for longer \u2013 cash taxes. And so, what happens with the PTCs and accelerated depreciation generated by this project? Maybe you've said that, but are you using a tax equity investor or are actually considering using that?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So, right now, we don't anticipate needing one, but we are monitoring very closely our tax appetite with our ability to use the PTCs as we take on a project the size of Wind Catcher and trying to make sure those things match up. That's something that's contemplated in the settlements that we're talking about. And to the degree that we're not able to use them on the same time, there will be an ability to defer the tax asset and earn some recovery on it.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call.

","Joining me this morning is Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer; Lisa Barton EVP of Utilities, Chuck Zebula, EVP Energy Supply; Mark McCullough, EVP Transmission; and Raja Sundararajan, President and COO of AEP Ohio. Brian will provide opening remarks and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Tierney","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for AEP\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. We all wish Nick a speedy recovery and a quick return.","The company is off to an excellent start for 2019. We are pleased to report solid earnings of $1.16 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.19 per share operating, which compares to $0.92 a share GAAP and $0.96 per share operating for the first quarter of 2018. The positive drivers were fully realized outcomes from a multitude of rate cases from 2017 to 2019, increased transmission margins from invested capital, and lower O&M, mostly timing in this case. The company continues to excel and our employees continue to deliver on the execution of our strategy of being the premium regulated utility. Overall, this was a great quarter for the company.","There are a few topics we\u2019d like to cover before moving on to coverage of our financial performance. First regarding the Oklahoma rate case outcome, this was an important case. While we didn\u2019t get everything we hoped to achieve, we were successful in gaining our most important objectives: an improved ROE opportunity, riders for transmission and some distribution investments, and most of all, a much improved regulatory environment. The outcome of the case bodes well for our continued focus on renewables and hopefully natural gas at some point in the state. I will discuss the regulated wind RFP initiative later. We certain appreciate the constructive focus of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the staff and parties on this case.","Our acquisition of the Sempra renewables portfolio is now finalized and we are moving forward with our renewables build-out according to plan. We have extended employment offers which have been accepted by many of the members of the previous Sempra team and we welcome them to the AEP family. We are excited about the acquisition of the existing operational projects, the additional developmental projects, and the Safe Harbor equipment that can provide additional value. ","In addition to that effort, we have significant opportunities for renewables in our regulated businesses. PSO and Swepco issued an RFP for up to 2,200 megawatts of wind generation. We have completed the bid process and received many quality responses. We are in the process of negotiating terms with the preferred bidders and plan to file with the state commissions in July requesting approvals to proceed. This should allow time for approvals in 2020 and for commercial operations of the projects by the end of 2021. As a reminder, these projects are consistent with our integrated resource plans and they are currently not included in our capital and funding plans.","Now to the Ohio Clear Air Fund legislation, the company is supportive to the Ohio House leadership\u2019s focus and efforts on addressing key energy policy issues that have plagued the state for years. In order for the legislation to benefit all Ohio customers, there are certain issues that must be addressed. First, an elimination of the renewable portfolio standard should be replaced with the opportunity for utilities to voluntarily develop economic renewable resources in the state. In addition, contracts entered into under the existing renewable portfolio standard must be grandfathered so as to not punish utilities who are compliant with Ohio law.","Second in regard to energy efficiency, AEP is concerned about a rapid elimination of EE programs that have benefited our customers for many years. In lieu of immediate elimination of EE programs, previously approved plans should be phased out over the next several years. We look forward to working with lawmakers during the process to achieve a balanced energy bill that provides benefits to all Ohio customers.","Turning to the equalizer chart on Slide 5, AEP\u2019s overall regulated operations ROE is currently 10.1% versus 9.7% last quarter, placing us at the upper end of our targeted range. The improvement in the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 is due to rate case outcomes in several of our jurisdictions as well as timing effects of lower O&M and taxes. ","Now let\u2019s take a look at the individual companies. The seat-adjusted ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the first quarter was 13.2% versus 13.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018. This year, we will only be showing the seat-adjusted ROE since the legacy items are rolling off throughout the year. We expect to end 2019 in the 13% range.","Appalachian Power\u2019s ROE at the end of the first quarter was 9.5%, comparable to last quarter. APCo received an order from West Virginia at the end of February approving their settlement, which includes a $44 million rate base increase with a 9.75% ROE, effective March 6 of this year. ","The ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of the first quarter was 8.6% compared to 9% at the end of 2018. The slight decline was primarily due to lower sales and usage driven by weather and an unfavorable tax adjustment. ","I&M\u2019s performance remains strong at 12.8% versus 11.4% at the end of 2018. I&M\u2019s positive performance is driven by the favorable rate reviews that occurred mid-2018 as well as continued discipline managing O&M expenses.","The ROE for PSO improved to 8% versus 6.9% at the end of 2018. This primarily reflects the implementation of the 2017 base rate case, better weather, and the absence of Wind Catcher expenses. PSO received an order on its base case settlement in March 2019 approving a $46 million increase and a 9.4% ROE. Rates went into effect in April of this year. Importantly, the order contained a provision for full transmission tracker and a partial distribution tracker. PSO is expected to approach its authorized ROE by the end of this year.","The ROE for Swepco stands at 7.2% versus 6.5% at the end of 2018. This improvement is due to incremental rate relief and lower O&M expenses, also reflecting the absence of Wind Catcher expenses. We filed an Arkansas base rate case in February seeking a $46 million rate increase based on a requested 10.5% ROE. Swepco\u2019s ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in rates. This impacts ROE by 135 basis points. ","The ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter was 7.6% versus 8.5% at the end of 2018. The expected decline in ROE is due to lag associated with the timing of annul filings and our base rate review that we plan to file with the PUCT on May 1 of this year. Continued high level of investments and timing of our planned comprehensive rate review will continue to impact the ROE in this year.","The ROE for AEP transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 9.9%, comparable to last quarter. The under-recovery of expenses that occurred in 2018 will be trued up this June. AEP transmission holdco is projected to achieve an ROE of approximately 10% by year end. ","We are off to a great start in 2019, so let\u2019s go through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight on load and the economy, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity.","Looking at Slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.19 per share or $585 million, compared to $0.96 per share or $473 million in 2018. Looking at the earnings drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.63 per share, up $0.16. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes due to recovery of incremental investment, AFUDC and transmission revenue, as well as lower O&M. Income taxes were also a driver for the quarter but will not be for the year due to timing. Partially offsetting these favorable items were lower normalized load, unfavorable weather compared to last year, and increased depreciation expense. ","The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.07 from last year primarily driven by the reversal of the regulatory provision in Ohio. Other favorable drivers included higher transmission revenue and rate changes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, O&M, and unfavorable weather.","The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.25 per share, an improvement of $0.04 over last year. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base. Net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 19% since March of last year. ","Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.09 per share, up a penny from last year. Increases in retail and wholesale margins were offset by lower generation sales due to plant retirements and outages. ","Finally, corporate and other was down $0.05 per share from last year primarily driven by unfavorable income tax adjustments and other consolidating tax items that will reverse by year end, other variance related to higher interest expense and lower O&M. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. Before we dig into the detail for the quarter, let me highlight some minor changes to the slide. You may have noticed that our growth estimates for the 2019 forecast of commercial and industrial sales have changed from what we presented in the last earnings release, while total and residential sales remain unchanged. This is due to a reclassification between the commercial and industrial classes. There were no customer, tariff or revenue impacts, just geography and presentations between the two classes. For ease of use, we have adjusted the prior quarters to reflect the new classifications.","Now let\u2019s look at the quarterly detail. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales decreased by three-tenths of a percent for the quarter compared to 2018. It is worth mentioning that retail sales were down at all of the vertically integrated utilities while each of the T&D utilities experienced modest growth in the quarter. Moving clockwise, industrial sales decreased by four-tenths of a percent for the quarter. Sales in the industrial class have been slowing in recent quarters as the impact of a strong dollar and a more restrictive trade policy have challenged export manufacturers within AEP\u2019s footprint. ","During last year\u2019s first quarter earnings call, we reported widespread growth across all operating companies in every one of the top 10 industrial sectors. Now a year later, industrial sales grew only in our western operating companies and Ohio, and in only six of the top 10 industrial sectors. The majority of this came from the oil and gas sectors. I\u2019ll provide more color on our industrial sales on the next slide.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales increased by nine-tenths of a percent compared with the first quarter of 2018. The growth in residential sales was partially due to customer count growth which increased by half a percent, while the rest came from growth in normalized usage. Incomes grew faster than inflation for the quarter, which provided our customers with more disposable income. I\u2019ll provide more detail on the economy later in the presentation. ","Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales decreased by 1.7%. Commercial sales were down across all operating companies. The tightening labor market and rising interest rates have limited this sector\u2019s growth in recent quarter. ","Turning to Slide 8, I want to provide a little more color with respect to our industrial sales. The chart shows the disparity in sales between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. The oil and gas sector load, shown in blue, mirrors the pattern in oil prices over time as expected. For the quarter, industrial sales in the oil and gas sectors increased by 5.1% while the rest of our industrial sales, shown in red, declined by 2.2%. We expect the growth in oil and gas to continue through 2019 as prices recover. In addition, our economic development team has identified a number of new oil and gas projects that are expected to come online throughout the year.","Now focusing on the red bars, you see the non-oil and gas industrials experienced robust growth in 2018 until the trade policy changes were announced at the end of the first quarter. Since then, a noticeable deceleration has occurred. Most of this slowdown can be traced back to export industries such as chemical manufacturing, which is down 9% for the quarter. As discussed on previous calls, AEP has a higher exposure to trade policy given the higher concentration of export manufacturers located within the service territory.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP\u2019s service territory was 2.9% for the quarter, which is a tenth of a percent above the U.S. Outside of Kentucky, GDP growth for every operating company was within two-tenths of a percent of the U.S. for the quarter. ","The upper right chart shows that the gap in employment growth between AEP service territory in the U.S. did not change in the first quarter. Job growth in AEP\u2019s territory was still 1.3% with higher growth coming from the west, where most of the oil and gas activity is located. In fact, job growth in the natural resources and mining sector posted the strongest growth in the quarter at 4.3%. Other sectors that experienced robust job growth for the quarter include construction, professional and business services, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality.","The final chart at the bottom shows that income growth within AEP\u2019s footprint improved in the first quarter while U.S. income growth moderated. For the quarter, personal incomes within AEP\u2019s service territory increased by 3.7%, which was half a percent below the U.S. As described earlier, income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales. ","Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 10 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased eight-tenths of a percent during the quarter to 57.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio finished the quarter at 18.1%. We expect this ratio to decline over the year as we flow back ADIT to customers, but expect the number to remain in the Baa1 range. Our net liquidity stood at about $3.1 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding decreased to 98% and our OPEB funding moderately increased to 131%. A drop in yields increased the liabilities for both plans but strong equity returns helped to offset the liability increases.","In March, AEP issued $805 million of mandatory convertible equity units. This issuance combines a three-year junior subordinated debt instrument with a three-year forward purchase contract for equity. This issuance de-risks our financing plan by providing required capital now and equity later when needed, and not sooner. It delays equity needs above our DRIP program until 2022. The issuance maintains our balance sheet strength, enhances our credit metrics, and allows us to invest growth capital for the benefit of our customers and for the recently closed renewables transaction.","Let\u2019s try and wrap this up on Slide 11 so we can get to your questions. We will move forward with opportunities in the renewable space and continue to optimize our O&M spend. Our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to re-affirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.20 per share. ","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much, hi guys.","Brian Tierney","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Morning. Maybe just the details on the mandatory convert in \u201922, what are the terms in terms of what price at which you expect the forward to convert into equity? ","Brian Tierney","It was priced at $82.98, and the company gets the benefit of the first 20% of upside, so to almost $100 per share, and we\u2019re locked in on the downside from that price.","Praful Mehta","Got you, thank you. Then on the renewables side, wanted to understand a couple of things. Is there any exposure that the current renewable business has to California in terms of PG&E or Edison in terms of any PP exposure as counterparties, and also want to understand when you say move forward with renewable opportunities in the future, are you looking at incremental investments even in 2019 beyond the Sempra acquisition?","Brian Tierney","A couple things there, Praful. We don\u2019t have any direct credit exposure to the California utilities on those. Most of those are direct third party consumers of that electricity, so we don\u2019t have that exposure that others do.","In regards to the investment in the renewables portfolio, we had talked about a five-year spend of about $2.2 billion with certain projects, including the renewables portfolio from Sempra. We\u2019ve spent about $1.5 billion of that commitment, so we have roughly $700 million left, and we\u2019re looking at opportunities as they become available. We feel the Sempra transaction was at a very good value to the company considering both the existing projects and the developmental projects, and we were able--by making that acquisition early in the five-year period, we were able to solidify and de-risk that $2.2 billion forecast of spend. We\u2019re on our way to meeting the $2.2 billion commitment, and we\u2019re evaluating development projects with the portfolio and looking at other opportunities as well. ","Praful Mehta","Got you, but you don\u2019t expect to go above the 2.2, it will stay within that budget? ","Brian Tierney","That\u2019s our anticipation at this point, yes.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Very helpful, thank you guys.","Brian Tierney","Thanks Praful.","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin","Hey, good morning everyone.","Brian Tierney","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin","Perhaps just to pick up where Praful left off, in terms of the incremental and the 2.2 versus the 1.5 commitment already, I understand that you have some inventory to assets that you acquired as part of that Sempra transaction. I\u2019d be curious, how do you think about leveraging that for further investments on the repowering side? When would you need to provide some updates, obviously just given the limited window remaining here from a Safe Harbor perspective, and then separately if you can clarify - obviously the 2.2 is over a five-year period. It would appear that at least from a timing perspective, you\u2019re ahead of what you\u2019d introduced from a ratable improvement in the EEI side last November, I would think. ","Brian Tierney","Yes, so Julien, I\u2019m going to ask Chuck Zebula, who runs that business and who you know, to address those questions.","Chuck Zebula","Yes, good morning, Julien. There are opportunities that we\u2019re pursuing. As you know, we just closed on the transaction on Monday. We\u2019re actively working with our new team members. The status of the development projects, even as we have taken over this week, there is some positive news coming out of a township vote in Michigan on one of our projects. There\u2019s still additional due diligence. We realize that the time is ticking to reach 2020. We may reach the light of day on one or two of these by 2020, but I can\u2019t commit to that at this point in time. They can turn into \u201921 projects with some structuring and items we would need to do with other parties, but nonetheless there are opportunities here and they're relatively small bites as opposed to significant large projects, and that\u2019s why we think a lot of these could get done within the $700 million that Brian had talked about.","Julien Dumoulin","Got it. Then in terms of timing for earnings?","Chuck Zebula","Well in terms of timing, I think absolutely we\u2019ll be updating quarterly where we are in some of this stuff. It\u2019s a full push forward, so--but yes, as we pulled the transaction and the spend earlier, you\u2019ll see the earnings from those contributions here in \u201919 and beyond.","Julien Dumoulin","Got it. Just to clarify this point, obviously you have a number of other RFPs out there on the Wind Catcher 2.0 structure. That\u2019s separate and distinct from any inventory to assets that you might have for repowering assets to meet the $2.2 billion bucket, right? ","Brian Tierney","That\u2019s correct, Julien, completely different efforts.","Julien Dumoulin","Excellent. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you, good morning. ","Brian Tierney","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Brian, in the past you folks have talked about confidence level trending to the higher end or the upper half of the 5 to 7% range of earnings and growth that you\u2019ve targeted. Are we still looking at it from that perspective, and also to clarify, that was based on the existing budget? That was not assuming new incremental capex, the existing budget could trend you in the upper half of 5 to 7? Is that correct?","Brian Tierney","That\u2019s right, Ali. I think the way Nick has phrased it before is this management team will be very disappointed if we\u2019re not in the upper end of that range.","Ali Agha","Upper end of the range - got you. Okay. Then separately, these RFPs and other opportunities, primarily I guess in renewables, that you are working on, can you give us some sense of size? I mean, if these do come through and you\u2019ve pointed out these would be incremental to the base plan, but what kind of cumulative size are we looking at in terms of that opportunity? ","Brian Tierney","The regulated RFPs that we\u2019ve issued in the market are for up to 2,200 megawatts, and the reason that that\u2019s the number is that\u2019s consistent with what our IRPs in those jurisdictions would call for, for renewables, so a significant amount not dissimilar to what we were talking about in terms of generation with Wind Catcher. ","Ali Agha","And that would be owned by AEP [indiscernible] if that comes through?","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Ali Agha","Okay, and the timing around that again?","Brian Tierney","We\u2019re shooting for the end of 2021.","Ali Agha","Got you.","Brian Tierney","Ali, to your point, that is--those plans are not in our capital and funding plans today, but we\u2019ll adjust those plans as we go forward and we firm up how much it is we\u2019re talking about and confirm that the timing is at the end of 2021. ","Ali Agha","I got you. Final question, Brian, on the transmission front, you put out a very strong growth outlook to 2021 very specifically. As you look out beyond that, at least through \u201923 since your capex budget goes out that many years, are you looking at a similar kind of growth over the \u201922, \u201923 period, or does it taper off? How are you looking at that transmission growth?","Brian Tierney","No, we see our ability to continue to grow investment in that space for the foreseeable future. One of the things when you have the largest transmission system in the country, you have the largest aging transmission system in the country, so there\u2019s significant opportunity for us to continue to invest in our own assets, and then there\u2019s also significant developments that we need to do on cyber and security and other efforts, where we\u2019re just beginning to see the front end of that significant increase in spend.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thanks Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turner with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Turner","Good morning, Brian. I have another question on renewables here, just broadly speaking. I think you talked about the value of the development portfolio within the Sempra purchase, but if you step back and think about the decision to buy that versus build it and the decision to kind of go in more of a wind versus a solar direction here, what informed those decisions and how do you think about your strategic edge in owning these assets versus others?","Brian Tierney","Christopher, Chuck and his team have been very selective in the assets that they\u2019ve looked at, looking for high quality contracted assets with credit-worthy counterparties, so they\u2019d been looking at that really on a project by project basis until this opportunity came along. What this opportunity brought with it was a lot of wind, some battery, contracted with high quality counterparties, but it also brought a team with it, and that team is something that we didn\u2019t organically have from a development standpoint. So we got not just a team, but also development projects in the pipeline that we wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise, so whether they\u2019re repowering or the new project that Chuck talked about with the municipal, it takes our business really to the next level. Not to say we\u2019re going to be the next NextEra, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our aspiration, but it firms up and de-risks our ability to put that $2.2 billion to work, like we talked about. ","I think with Chuck\u2019s existing commercial team, their conservative approach to making sure that we get high quality assets combined with the new development team that we get from Sempra, I think we have a pretty strong organization to go forward and execute against the strategic plans that we\u2019ve laid out.","Christopher Turner","Is it fair to think about the returns that you\u2019re going to get there long term as being pretty competitive with what you\u2019re earning at the T&D businesses and the generation businesses today on the utility side?","Brian Tierney","Very much so.","Christopher Turner","Okay. My second question is a follow-up to an earlier one on the long term EPS guidance. I wanted to make sure I was properly understanding here. You have a situation where you\u2019d be disappointed if you weren\u2019t at the high end of the 5 to 7% range, and just year-to-date you\u2019ve pulled forward that capex with the Sempra deal, you\u2019ve had a constructive settlement in Oklahoma that\u2019s going to allow you to earn a more fair return there, and you still have the potential for the RFP on the utility side with the renewables. Is there any timing shift within that 5 to 7% range that\u2019s occurred here, or is still back end weighted for the high end of that range?","Brian Tierney","As we talk about this year, we believe we\u2019re on track to be inside that $4 to $4.20 range, which puts us in the mid-part of that range I think as we execute against some of these things, it\u2019s going to take time for them to cumulatively push us to the higher end of that range, so I\u2019d say no change on this year, and as we look forward to future years as we execute both regulated and some of these competitive opportunities, I think that\u2019s when we\u2019ll be expecting to be in the upper end of that range.","Christopher Turner","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks Brian.","Brian Tierney","Thanks Christopher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good morning.","Brian Tierney","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","On the significant excess, the seat reversal, can you tell us--I apologize, what triggered that, because it looks like it was a 2016 item that reversed. Could you--?","Brian Tierney","Paul, it was a number of things. It was--2016 was the year that we had the global settlement in Ohio and there was some risk as to whether or not issues that were included in the global settlement would be included in the calculation of seat for that year. We believed they should have been excluded and that\u2019s the basis on which we filed our 2016 seat. We had a unanimous settlement saying that there was no significantly excess earnings in 2016 and did not get an order on that until this year. When we looked at that, we had significant risk around that, were uncomfortable at that point given the risks that existed in taking that to income, made the reserve at the time, and now with the positive order on the settlement are able to reverse that.","Paul Patterson","Wow, they took that long for a settlement--for an order, excuse me. That\u2019s non-recurring, right?","Brian Tierney","I want to be clear about that. It\u2019s included in GAAP earnings and we\u2019ve included it in ongoing earnings, but it\u2019s an item that will not repeat next year.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Then with respect to the Ohio legislation, previously you guys, I think had concerns about AEP utility ratepayers paying for other companies\u2019 nuclear plants. How do you guys feel about HP6 as it currently stands? I mean, I know you raised a couple of the issues in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on that.","Brian Tierney","Yes, so we think if there\u2019s a full package where all of Ohio customers can benefit, then it\u2019s a worthy effort. If it\u2019s just a bailout for one company or another, it\u2019s not as beneficial to all Ohio customers, so there needs to be a full package of things that get addressed, and energy efficiency, the renewable portfolio standard, ability of utilities to invest in renewables going forward are all important things that need to be in the bill, and if they\u2019re not, it\u2019s not as beneficial for ratepayers in the state.","Paul Patterson","Okay, I got you. Then with the energy efficiency, if those changes did take place, do you think that would have a meaningful impact on your retail sales growth?","Brian Tierney","We do not.","Paul Patterson","Okay, thanks so much.","Brian Tierney","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Brian, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, can you remind us what the sensitivity to changes in weather normalized demand are in terms of meeting not just current year guidance but your multi-year growth rate? I ask, and I know it\u2019s only one quarter, but some of the demand metrics on the commercial side seem pretty weak and that\u2019s obviously--you know, you get a lot of demand from industrial but it tends to be lower margin, but commercial and residential tends to be higher margin.","Brian Tierney","We\u2019re trying to look up what those sensitivities are right now. We think that we\u2019re on track to get where we need to be for the year, even though we\u2019re slightly off for the first quarter. Again, we make more from places where we sell integrated utility products than just the T&D side, but for changes--you know, 5% change in res--I\u2019m sorry, half a percent change in residential is half a penny for T&D utilities. For vertically integrated utilities, it\u2019s 1.4%. Commercial again is about half that, half a percent change; for vertically integrated utilities, it is seven-tenths of a penny. For T&D utilities, it\u2019s a tenth of a penny, and for industrial sales half a percent change is the same as it is for commercial, seven-tenths of a penny for vertically integrated and a tenth of a penny for T&D utilities.","Michael Lapides","Got it, thank you. One other question - just trying to think about Texas. What\u2019s driving the under-earning in Texas? I mean, Texas is a state where you\u2019ve got both transmission and distribution cost recovery riders, so just curious what\u2019s the biggest driver of the regulatory lag you\u2019re experiencing now?","Brian Tierney","There\u2019s a couple things going on there, Michael. One is the fact that we are investing so much in the state that even with those very timely recoveries, we just can\u2019t keep up with the amount of capital that we\u2019re putting to work in the state. Second thing is as we go in for the base rate case this year, we need to suspend those short term trackers for the near term until we get everything caught up in the base rate case, and then we can put those trackers back in the space. That is going to cause a little bit of lag this year and next year as well. ","Michael Lapides","Got it, thanks Brian. Much appreciated. ","Brian Tierney","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Andrew Weisel. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning everybody. Congratulations on the PSO outcome. My question there is does this change your capex plan at all? With a transmission tracker, would you consider increasing capex at PSO, and would that drive an increase of the overall spending or would it be shifted away from other subsidiaries? I see the pie chart is unchanged, but just wondering how to think about that. ","Brian Tierney","What this means for us is that Oklahoma is open for business again, so we had previously, when we were under that prolonged period of under-earning at PSO, we had shifted capital to more welcoming jurisdictions that allowed us to have higher ROEs and that had trackers. Now that we have appropriate trackers in Public Service of Oklahoma, we\u2019re going to shift capital that had been shifted away from Oklahoma back into the state and have that benefit the ratepayers and customers in that state. It\u2019s not so much a huge increase, although it is, but we\u2019re shifting dollars back in that had been shifted out, and that\u2019s positive for PSO.","Andrew Weisel","Makes a lot of sense. My other question is on Ohio wind. My understanding is you\u2019re able to own up to 450 megawatts out of the 500 planned. My question is for the portion signed through PPA, would you expect a debt equivalency cost mechanism? I know you have that for solar, but it\u2019s small. How do you think about that for wind PPAs?","Brian Tierney","Yes, we would expect a debt equivalency on those as well. If our utilities balance sheets are being consumed to support PPAs, we need to be compensated for that, and the rating agencies ding us for those and we need to make sure that we\u2019re filling in the gap that we\u2019re getting dinged for by entering into those PPAs. We think debt equivalency is appropriate really on all renewable PPAs that we don\u2019t own.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. I know there\u2019s not a lot of precedent - obviously Michigan just settled upon that. You used the word need twice in your answer there. Is that a nice to have, or a must have?","Brian Tierney","How can I say this? It\u2019s appropriate to have them and it\u2019s inappropriate not to have them.","Andrew Weisel","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Brian Tierney","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I wanted to go back to 2019 guidance. The Sempra acquisition came earlier than expected, and you mentioned that it would be earnings accretive this year. The Oklahoma rate case settlement was better than expected, so what\u2019s the negative offsets that you\u2019re still in the middle of the range?","Brian Tierney","There\u2019s a couple things going on. In addition to the Sempra acquisition, there are also some financing costs associated with that, so we do expect gen and marketing to be ahead a couple pennies, we expect corporate and other to be a drag as we finance that. Our AEP transmission holdco, while improving, is not going to be as strong as what we thought it was going to be when we provided guidance due to some tracking items on O&M and due to our inability to get everything into the capital base that we thought we would be the end of last year. So like any year, there are things that are positive, there are things that are negative as we work our way through the year, and we still anticipate being in the midpoint of the guidance range.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. The Swepco and PSO renewables, can we assume that all of these assets would be rate based?","Brian Tierney","Yes, that\u2019s what the RFP asked for - build, operate, transfer two PSO and Swepco projects, and that\u2019s largely how people responded, and we would anticipate owning them and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll file with the commissions in July.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","As a reminder, if you do wish to ask a question, please press star, one. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Lonegan with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Hi, it\u2019s Greg Gordon, how are you doing? ","Brian Tierney","Hey Greg.","Greg Gordon","Just a follow-up on Paul Patterson\u2019s question on the reversal of the seat test issue. When you initially booked that in the first instance, was that also considered an operating item, so this is kind of equal opportunity - it was a drag in that year, and now that you reversed it, it\u2019s a help, but in all cases you\u2019re consistently applying that methodology?","Brian Tierney","Absolutely, Greg. It was GAAP and operating in both periods.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you. Just wanted to clarify that. The second thing, just as a follow-up to Angie\u2019s question, I just want to make sure that I\u2019m not getting the implication wrong when you said that you\u2019re going to be ahead in the renewables business but then you have the financing costs associated with financing Sempra. Is the implication that the Sempra transaction is not really accretive on an earning basis in \u201919, and if not so, what\u2019s the math there and how does that trend over time?","Brian Tierney","No Greg, it will be accretive in \u201919, it will be accretive going forward. Remember the financing was larger than what was needed just for that one project, but it\u2019s an accretive project in the current period and in forward periods, inclusive of financing costs.","Greg Gordon","Ah, I understand, but then part of that equity was allocated to just general corporate needs, and we have to think about it that way?","Brian Tierney","That\u2019s correct.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. ","Bette Jo Roza","Okay, well thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Ryan, would you please give the replay information?","Operator","Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, as you heard, this conference is available for replay.

Barton - Executive Vice President of AEP Transmission","Charles E. Zebula - Executive Vice President of Energy Supply","Mark C. McCullough - Executive Vice President of Generation","Richard E. Munczinski - Senior Vice President of Regulatory Services","Nicholas K. Akins","While everyone's getting a seat, good morning, and welcome to AEP's Analyst and Investor Meeting today, and thank you for your interest in AEP as well. So I guess, legally, please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement in the package that was given to you, so -- and we'll continue with the presentation.","We have an excellent lineup of speakers today, and it's great to be back after 1 year, back in the saddle again with providing guidance, but also really providing a growth story for AEP. We're in a distinct position now, where we've cleared the decks, where now, we can really start thinking about how we reposition the company. And I think you're going to hear a pretty compelling story about why you should be investing in AEP.","So we have an excellent lineup of speakers. Brian Tierney, CFO, will be up here a little bit later with the financial update. But we also have Lisa Barton, who heads up our transmission effort. I know there's a lot of questions about transmission. It's a major growth area for us, and we're very focused on that type of business. She's going to talk about some of the issues that I'm sure you have questions about relative to ROEs and things like that associated with transmission. And then Chuck Zebula, who you all know has taken over the competitive part of our business. So as we move toward that competitive environment in Ohio, he's very focused on dealing with the -- what will be unregulated generation, along with our retail play and the wholesale trading operation that goes along with that. So with those speakers, we should be in a position to answer many of your questions on the front end, so -- but if you have questions after that, certainly, we'll be happy to take them.","We also have some of our senior leaders here in the audience as well. I wanted to at least point them out, so if you have questions, you can catch them as well later. Bob Powers, who's our Chief Operating Officer. If you could just raise your hand, Bob? Rich Munczinski, who heads our regulatory efforts, so all of the regulatory questions, you can go to him. And then Mark McCullough, who heads up our Generation area, heavily involved with the environmental effort and other activities associated with moving to the unregulated generation. And then, Lonni Dieck and Julie Sloat are here as well. Julie, I think you know from the past as well. So we have a very, very strong team here and people here who can answer the questions that you might have.","So let's talk about what you're going to hear today. There's a positive story about our accomplishments in 2012, and I think you're going to see, we did a lot to clear the decks and eliminate risk for this company, but even more so, we're in the position now where we can talk about the strategic repositioning of our corporation.","So as you see from the slide here, we delivered 2012 GAAP and operating earnings of $2.60 and $3.09, respectively. I think we beat consensus on 2012. And then now, we're providing guidance again, for 2013 and 2014. 2013 guidance is in the range of $3.05 to $3.25 per share, and then operating earnings range for 2014 is $3.15 to $3.45, with midpoints at $3.15 and $3.30, respectively.","Earnings growth we'll reaffirm at 4% to 6%. We think that's supported by our regulated companies. And we're also, with board approval, increasing our dividend payout ratio, supported by the earnings of the regulated operations. Previously, we had 50% to 60%. We're raising that to 60% to 70%.","You're also going to see that a lot of work's been done to make sure we have a strong foundation for growth, but also a strong foundation financially. Brian will be talking about the things that they have done relative to the financial effort, and it ensures that we're well into BBB credit rating and certainly well positioned to be able to move through the process of unregulated generation and so forth related to Ohio.","And then the transmission growth. I hope -- you've probably had a chance to read the book at this point and know all the answers, but you look at the transmission growth, it's phenomenal. We continue to focus on that piece of the business. I think when you look at this business for the future, when you're retiring generation, when you're thinking about new sources of renewable energy and so forth, transmission will be key to that, robust transmission, and it certainly is a compelling growth engine for this company.","The generation profile is changing, obviously. Chuck will be talking about that in detail, but generation is one of those areas where we'll still have a huge amount of regulated generation, but as a result of the corporate separation in Ohio, we'll be moving some of that generation out to an unregulated effort, and we'll work to hedge that. The Ohio situation is clarified. We were in the situation last year where there were orders going back and forth and a lot of changes were occurring during the year, and it was very difficult for us to provide guidance. But now, we have a clear path toward an unregulated environment and a competitive environment in Ohio, and we're well positioned to take advantage of that as well.","But I do want to reaffirm to you that we are a regulated utility. We're 86% regulated; 14% unregulated; 4%, we already had with river operations; the other 10%, we'll pick up after the corporate separation. But we still are a regulated utility, and that is our focus. And in the future, you'll see that we'll continue to focus on regulated operations as well.","So let's move on to some of the detail. For 2012, there were a lot of operational accomplishments, but things that you'll see that really presents a foundation for us so we can start really thinking about the growth and repositioning of the company. So 2012 was all about clearing the decks, all about reducing risk and repositioning the company for quality customer service and growth.","So I always maintain, the first part of the slide is around safety. We had 0 fatalities during 2012, and we had one of the best safety records from an occurrence standpoint and a severity standpoint that we've had ever at AEP, and that's the first early indicator you'll see of operational excellence in any company. We maintain that. We focus on it. And it's shown during the work that we've done during the year.","So the things we did from a construction standpoint: Dresden, a combined cycle gas unit, we brought online early in the year. And then what we're very proud of is the John W. Turk ultra-supercritical coal plant, which we brought on December 22 of last year. It went online in 2012, and we said it would go online before the end of 2012. It was important to do that from a regulatory standpoint. But from an operational standpoint, we couldn't be more proud of the way that, that unit is operating. In fact, we originally anticipated that it would be one of the lowest heat rate coal units in the country; it is. But in fact, it's even lower than we anticipated. We thought it would be 8,900 Btu\/kWh heat rate. It's coming in at 8,700 Btu\/kWh heat rate. And for our coal unit -- our average coal unit heat rate's about 10,000 Btu\/kWh, so significantly better. That means less emissions, less carbon emissions and certainly, a very positive addition to the fleet for SWEPCO.","We also participated in several storm activities. The derecho, which was amazing given there was only a 10% chance of thunderstorms, rolled through Ohio and our West Virginia territories and Virginia territories and on into Washington and so forth. But the derecho was an eye-opening experience for us because we had to mobilize crews very quickly in response to that kind of effect. We responded well. Certainly, it was during the hottest part of the year, and our Ohio customers and West Virginia customers were truly troubled by the heat and the time it took to get customers back. But we did get customers back very quickly. There were some that took upwards to a week, and that was certainly a serious issue for us, and we mobilized crews effectively as a result. We're very proud of the efforts associated with that given the conditions that were occurring.","We also participated heavily in hurricane -- or Superstorm Sandy. We had about 3 feet of snow in West Virginia, so we had to recover our own customers and then we moved on with substantial crews to the Northeast to support that cleanup effort. And I would -- this is probably one area where I would say the President was intimately involved. We had CEO calls where President Obama did join the call and was very focused on the effort in terms of cleanup us well, and it really forged a new relationship between the federal government and the utilities in support of these kinds of major calamities. So certainly, it was a great learning experience for the entire industry, and we'll continue to take those lessons learned as well.","We also further optimized, and as you'll see later in the capital associated with our environmental spend, we further optimized that environmental compliance situation. So we'll talk more in detail about how that occurred. But certainly, as the EPA came out with the final orders and some of these rules, we saw that there was some opportunities to reduce the capital spend associated with that. It's important for us to reduce that spend, to levelize it so that we can we reallocate capital to other parts of the business, such as Transmission. And we're very focused on doing that, and you'll see that we've been very successful in doing that.","The growth in Transmission has been very good for us. The CREZ buildout in Texas in ETT continues to grow. And we've had $720 million of cumulative investment into Transcos, which is a considerable positive associated with that.","We also completed settlement related to the turbine outage that we had at Cook. We achieved a settlement with NEIL, the nuclear insurance mutual company related to that outage.","The Ohio situation. We've been through multiple orders and multiple areas where we had to deal with capacity cases, ESP cases, all those types of things, but we finally reached a point where we have clarity related to Ohio, and that's a good thing. I think certainly, the commission and the company was very focused on trying to achieve a solution that made sense for the customers in Ohio but also made sense for the company. And we wound up in the situation where we do have that clarity to move forward, and that's a great thing.","We also have filed all the FERC cases, and they're going well. We continue to have discussions with the interveners in those cases and with the states involved, and those communications are going very well, as well, on the transfer of those -- of generation to APCo in Kentucky.","So really, when you look at the suite of changes from an operational accomplishment perspective, it's very impressive to go through that. From the financial accomplishment standpoint, we did a lot in terms of securitization. Earlier in the year, we securitized bonds at Texas Central, and then we also are in the process and will soon complete securitization around the reg assets in Ohio and then some of the deferred fuel costs in West Virginia. So that securitization is important for us so that we can continue capitalizing in other areas. We also expect, and we did get -- begin recovery of the deferred fuel in Ohio, but we also expect by 2014 to have securitization in place for that as well.","And then we also, from a parent debt perspective, refinanced a considerable amount of parent debt at advantageous yields, and you'll see the numbers there, that very substantial positive benefit for the company ongoing.","And then from a discretionary contributions to the qualified pension, we made $200 million of contributions to the pension during 2012. We were funded at 92% at the end of the year. I'm pleased to say at the end of January, that's 93.7%, so we stand very good in terms of our pension being well funded.","And then we also changed some medical benefits for retirees. And we've done an overall benefits review, compared to market peers in the space, and we've made certain changes that actually provided benefits of $460 million on our OPEB liability.","So it's been pretty substantial changes from a financial standpoint that positions us well for the future. And we'll continue to address those types of issues, which I'll talk about in the repositioning later on.","So the next slide is my favorite, it always is. I always call it my equalizer slide. But one thing about it, today is very different than last year. Last year, when you think about the complexity of what we were dealing with -- and I know many analysts believe that we're in multiple jurisdictions and it makes this very complicated.  We're seeing that clear up considerably. And now, where diversity used to be an element of complexity, now we believe it's an element of strength. Because as you can see, these have changed from last year. And I went back to the February 10th presentation of last year and looked at the ROEs of the various companies, and you see them going up and down, based upon where they're at in the cycle from a regulatory standpoint and also, based upon the work -- the incredible amount of work that's being done by our operating company presidents to bring more concurrent rate recovery and improve the ROEs.","Now as you probably remember, Ohio was at 12.81% last year. It's now at 11.1%, which is lower than what we actually anticipated at this time last year. I think it was a very -- it was a very tough process we went through with the Ohio Commission, but it's one where we do have clarity now and we're at a point where we've achieved and continue to achieve the 11.1% return on equity, which is very, very credible, but also, at the same time, the other states improved. So the jurisdictions have really worked together to come out with an overall ROE of 10.6%.","So I'm going to go across here and explain to you some of the differences. In APCo, we were at 7.48% last year, and -- which was low. We knew it was low. We talked to you about some of the things we were trying to do to move the ROE up. And today, it's at 9.4% ROE. We actually anticipated it to come to 9.2% at the time, but we've done better there.","Also, at Kentucky Power, many people were asking at that point in time what we were going to do with Kentucky Power because it was lower at 9.66%. It's now at 11.1%. So incredible amount of progress there as well. And there are substantial cases that are continuing on, obviously with the transfer of capacity from the unregulated fleet, and that's going very well in those jurisdictions.","I&M is the one that we have really been focusing on. Last year, I&M was at 8.82%, and it shows up at 7% here. And it's because of all the capital that's being deployed, but it's also because of the regulatory lag. This is the -- probably the largest regulatory lag situation that we have on our system. We just completed a case 2 days ago that's certainly going to help us improve the ROE as an $85 million benefit and it also sets the tone for the future. We expect the ROE to improve there. But even more so, we've been working on the legislative front to try to address the issue of regulatory lag. And we now have a bill that's passed through the Senate in Indiana that would provide for not only more concurrent regulatory recovery. It's a 10-month period to get a case completed, and if you don't get it completed in the 10 months, then you have 75% of rates going into effect at that point in time. It also has a forward-looking test year. So those are the kinds of things that we're focusing on from a legislative standpoint and a regulatory standpoint to support the ROEs being more concurrent with existing capitalization, because we have a lot to spend at I&M.","As you know, we're doing a loss cycle management on our Cook nuclear station. It's about a $1.2 billion investment, a pretty substantial investment. And now we're deploying it in Michigan, where we have 80% of that preapproved, with a deferral associated with it, and then the other 20% will go into a rate case. And then in Indiana, we're still working on the process with the Indiana Commission on that, but we fully expect to get some kind of pre-approval there as well. So it's important for us to understand it's not new nuclear, it's replacement of existing components so that we can extend the life. And we have a life extension for -- that's approved for Cook, and we need to make these investments. And they're also very positive investments when you look at the overall scheme of these types of investments versus other opportunities that may exist out there. So a very positive message there, and we fully expect I&M to improve.","As you can see, the Western companies continued to perform well. PSO, we always call it the Utility of the Year in our space because they have the best safety record. They have -- certainly from a customer satisfaction standpoint, they're very good, and that's what we're after. Happy customers obviously make happy regulators, and that's something that we're very focused on.","SWEPCO, just yesterday, had a hearing and are now in a position where the settlement, it was approved that would include Turk in the formula-based rates is now moving to the commissioner for approval. And as you know, in Louisiana, the commissioners are -- I think they're meeting in the next couple of weeks, so we should be able to get a result there, and we expect it to be positive.","So AEP Texas continues to benefit as well.","Now what's going on in our Western properties, we continue to see growth in those areas, certainly driven by shale gas activity. The oil and gas activity has been very positive in those territories, and we expect that to continue at least for the next couple of years for the buildout, and then pump load and other things will continue to drive that. We're also seeing a pretty significant list of new proposed projects, industrial projects, in those territories as well. So we're very keen on our Western properties continuing to improve.","So with that, I'll move on to the next slide. What we have, so far, from an AEP return and stock performance perspective, if you look at the 1-, 3- and 5-year TSRs, we're very attractive against not only the S&P 500 utilities, but the S&P 500 itself. For 1-year, 3-year and 5-year, we've outperformed each one of those, with the exception of the S&P 500 when you take the 1 year into account, primarily because of the dividend tax issue that came about and also the market issues that exist today. So we are very, very fortunate to be able to perform well against both of those measures. in fact, you look at the right side of the graph, and we've actually eliminated that 17% discount that we had last year. We told you that we were very focused on eliminating that discount, and it is now eliminated.","Now that's to the S&P 500. We're not happy with that because we want to do better. We want to measure up against -- well against the regulated utilities, but also, we believe that when you look at the risk profile of AEP and what we've done during the last year, and once we get through corporate separation, you're going to see utilities that pretty much operate the same way in terms of recovery mechanisms and so forth. We believe we should trade at a premium. So we're not through yet. We have a lot of work to do, but that's what we're focused on.","So why do we have a strong investment platform? Well, there are several reasons. As we said earlier, we're predominantly a regulated business, but we're focused on clarity, execution, line-of-sight and discipline. Those are the things that we need to do to achieve very positive customer service, where regulators are comfortable with what we're doing, having discussions with our regulators on an operating company perspective that are meaningful, particularly in light of the changes going on in our Eastern footprint. In the past, we had this convoluted issue of the pool. Once we get past the pool, then each utility will be responsible for its own resources and decisions around that. And I think that's a very credible conversation for commissions to have, particularly in light of the multitude of technology and preferences associated with resources that we have today. So I think it's going to be very positive for us and it continues to be, as evidenced by the graph that I showed you earlier.","Significant Transmission growth opportunities. The amount of Transmission growth, I think if you see the earnings slide from later on that -- Lisa, I hate to steal your thunder -- but that continues to grow substantially. And we have plenty of projects in Transmission. We now have a repositioned business, where we have fortified the resources for Transmission to ensure that it can continue to grow. And as I go through the repositioning exercise, you'll see the linkage of that to making sure that the Transmission business does have those resources.","And we now have stable regulatory relationships. Our operating company presidents are very focused, very determined to have positive relationships with our commission, with the legislators and so forth. They have more of a say. They are now doing the capital allocation among their own operating companies. And that's an important distinction because when an operating company president can talk to a regulator with a sense of authority, that is a positive thing, and that's something we're very committed to.","From the cost structure perspective, the repositioning certainly helped us in that regard. I think you'll see later on that we've kept O&M flat from year to year. The repositioning exercise enabled us to do that. It's not done. It's not over. There's more work to do, but we are seeing substantial benefits associated with that. We have -- out of that process, we had 80% of our Gavin plant looking at lean practices. We had teams of employees from across the company working on ways to not only review processes, but also to eliminate those things that didn't make sense to us anymore. And they came up with a very, very good slate of reductions associated with our O&M.","And also, the outgrowth of that is a strong culture of collaboration. In combination with our repositioning study, we are also having a very focused effort on changing the culture of AEP, more toward an entrepreneurial culture that's willing to change and is willing to move forward with many of the changes we have relative to the growth engines of the company.","The Ohio generation fleet is certainly in the process of being formed. It's being put together with the retail and the wholesale marketing business. Our wholesale business has been around for years. It's a very credible business. We've kept it in place. I do want to reiterate that the reason why we have our wholesale business, our retail business, is really to focus on hedging that generation. It's not about being a national energy player in terms of retail. That's not what we're about. What we are focused on is margins in our retail play, not -- and that's focused on specific customers. It's not about how many kilowatt hours or how many megawatt hours you can serve. That's not a good thing for us. We're trying to maximize the hedging margins associated with that generation that becomes available.","So the growth opportunities are driven by the investments in the regulated properties, and our dividend growth is certainly supported by that.","Okay, next slide, please. Okay, so from a fleet transformation perspective. I've talked a lot about the transformation that's occurring in the resources of AEP. Historically, our culture was that if a coal unit went down, we did everything possible and spent everything possible to keep it running. We wanted to keep it running 100% of the time. Today's analysis is very different. Not only is it a measure of how you run the generation, but also what capital investments you make and are they, in fact, going to pay back over a period of time. And we look at the lifetime of the units. And as a clear indication, the Big Sandy example that you probably all have heard about. We anticipate that we would put a scrubber on Big Sandy, and it didn't work out that way. And the reason why is because of economics, but also a further review of coal in our footprint. We're looking at it from a portfolio perspective. We want to see a balancing out of our portfolio. And actually, the shale gas revolution in our Eastern footprint has been very positive in terms of our ability to take advantage of trying to reprioritize and balance out our fleet from a coal perspective.","So you'll see our coal capacity come down. We plan on retiring additional generation in the '14, '15, '16 time period. And that's certainly something that we're focused on doing to ensure that not only are we meeting the EPA obligations, but from a financial standpoint, we're putting customers in the best position to take advantage of lower cost resources as they become available.","In 2012, we had generation from a gas perspective increase 40% to 50% in our Eastern footprint. That's just a phenomenal change. But it also said that we had the flexibility to go back and forth between coal and gas that benefited customers. So in the first 3 quarters of the year where natural gas prices were lower than $3.25, we were burning more natural gas. Then as the winter months ensued and -- really, our breakpoint is around $3.25. So when you get past $3.25 on the gas price, our coal units are going to start picking up at full capacity. So during the latter part of the year, the coal capacity factors picked up.","So it's those kinds of things that are going to be very positive, not only for our customers, but also positive for Chuck's generation effort as well because he'll emerge with 2\/3 coal, fully compliant coal that's very positive from a delivery standpoint, from a fuel perspective and so forth, but also, 1\/3 natural gas. So it'll wind up being a great combination for him.","Estimating the capital spend for our environmental effort. Originally, we started with a $6 billion to $8 billion anticipated capital outlay for these types of requirements. And that changed, from $5 billion to $7 billion, over a period of time when the EPA came up with the -- came out the rules, particularly on particulate matter. We had one situation where, instead of achieving 99.7% removal rate, the proposed rule was saying you had to achieve 99.9%, and that 0.2% was costing us about $800 million. So the EPA did listen and made the adjustments, so that adjusted reduction down as a result. And then now, we're saying the cost is going to be from $4 billion to $5 billion. And we've looked at technologies. We believe from a compliance standpoint that we can achieve further compliance reductions as a result of technology improvements, but also how we run the generation. So those are the kinds of things that we're looking at as well.","We also have a proposed settlement relative to Rockport that would enable us to achieve the environmental compliance necessary. So we have reflected that in our capital plans as well.","So we believe it's going to be $4 billion to $5 billion, and we're committed to continuing down that process. But now -- right now, it says $4 billion to $5 billion. We still have analysis to do at the time every time we make a decision relative to these compliance measures, and we will be making wise decisions with a blank slate in the decision around coal versus gas or any other type of resource. We include transmission as a resource. We include renewables, energy efficiency, demand side management, all those are resources that we need to take a look at. But clearly, we're probably one of the few that look at transmission as a major resource as well.","Next slide. Okay, so let me talk a little bit about the repositioning cost study that we did. Had a lot of questions during the last half of the year about how the study was going, always said the study was going fine. It was a very positive thing for AEP to do. I don't -- it'd been years since AEP went through a process looking from top to bottom at the processes that we actually have. And it turns out that the reductions that came into play that enabled us to keep O&M flat and reposition resources over to the transmission effort, over to Chuck's competitive business effort, we were able to achieve that because 75% of the reductions are relative to the process changes alone.","Some of those things are like looking at everything from gloves to equipment from a supply chain perspective, to look at the efficiencies there. We had thousands of different types of gloves. We brought it down to less than 100 pairs of different kinds of gloves. So it's those kinds of things that are very simple, but they're things you have to go through to make sure you are achieving the objective. 75%, as I said earlier, were those kinds of process changes. And as I mentioned earlier at Gavin plant, 80% of the people were involved, including the unions, in determining a solution for that. We had over 1,000 contractors working for AEP. And by looking at what they did versus what the needs of the company were, we were able to take advantage of lowering the contractor requirements as well, and that provided significant benefits for AEP.","Now there's nothing like having an AEP employee that has that focus, that has that determination to get the job done on a regular basis, and that's, in fact, the way we look at it.","Now we also put 5 initial teams in place, and you see the 5 listed there. They were the major areas that we saw immediate savings in, but there's some work that's continuing to go on related to some of those efforts. We not only achieve the benefits that are reflected in the 2013 guidance that we've shown you, but also for areas like information technology, IT, those areas may be more of a 2- to 3-year process that we go through as we redefine the way we serve customers within our IT organization. We slowed that process down because we didn't want to impair the other changes that are so dependent upon the IT solution. So it is a stage thing, and you will see additional benefits in future years associated with these initiatives as we move from Gavin to all of the other power plants in terms of lean practices and as we look at IT. So those are very positive benefits.","The study reinforced that our resource allocations throughout the company should be focused on customer service and focused on those growth areas, and that enabled us to do that.","And also, the cost profile, as I said earlier, substantially absorbs the O&M, and that's why you're seeing a flat O&M line from 2012 to 2013, which is different, I think, than other utilities have reported relative to their O&M. We also see a further mitigation in O&M costs in the future as well as a result of this repositioning effort, and as a result of the cultural changes that are occurring within our company.","So moving ahead to the dividend policy. That's probably the -- one of the surprises for today. Our current yield is 4.2%. Our current payout ratio is 59.7%, and it shouldn't be in small letters; it should be in big letters that we paid 410 consecutive quarters of dividends. So we're very proud of that and fully intend on it continuing. The board did review and increased the targeted payout ratio to 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings to bring us more in line with the regulated utilities, and it showed the confidence that the board had in our ability to produce those kinds of dividend payouts.","The dividend level is obviously -- we talked about this in the last presentation. When you look at PP&E and the regulatory piece of the business, it certainly does support that dividend level. And then the board is also very committed to the dividend that's expected to grow in line with our earnings from the regulated operations. So that is a very positive thing and certainly something that the board will continue to review.","Then as you can see our dividend history, we've continued to increase the dividend, and it's been very positive, and we fully intend on our dividend policy to be positive for our shareholders.","So our expected growth rate. We reaffirmed our expected growth rate of 4% to 6% using 2013 as a base because, when we move from 2012 to '13 with the Ohio situation, you look at Ohio and look at the ROE, it's come down substantially; it had a tremendous impact on the revenue of the company. We have been able to mitigate that with the other states. The other states have been very, very positive. And as well, from a cost control and discipline standpoint, we've been able to absorb the tremendous impact of the Ohio situation. Nevertheless, we are seeing the 4% to 6% growth rate in the future based on the 86% regulated business that I talked about previously.","We also felt confident enough to give 2 years of guidance with that growth, so you'll see that we had 2013 and 2014 ranges for guidance. The range for 2014 is a little bit broader because we still have some issues to get through with corporate separation and other things, and we wanted to make sure that we're able to fine-tune that as we go forward.","Our capital program. Very proud of our capital program. We were looking at huge cliffs to overcome associated with our capital program. We don't have that now. We've really focused on mitigating the capital impacts and making sure that we're able to manage within that so that we're not having to issue additional equity, other than the DRIP that's currently in process. And we're very committed to having the capital plan to do that. The $3.6 billion in 2013 and the $3.8 billion in '14 and '15, respectively, provide for the benefits not only from the environmental compliance perspective, but a lot of block and tackle type of spending that typically regulatory recovery is not an issue. And now you're seeing not only how much we're spending to attract growth, but where we're spending it is even more important. And that's something we're very, very focused on in getting it right. And that's what the operating company model is about, to make sure that there's conversations with the commissions and our customers to ensure that we are spending on the right things. And certainly, from a transmission perspective, that is a growth area, and we're trying to do everything we can do to refocus investment there as well. And that certainly improves the reliability and the customer service experience. So very focused on that.","Our authorized ROE range across the board, if you look at the 2 bounds, 9.96% in AEP Texas, that's related to the transmission. That's been in place for a pretty long period of time. The recovery mechanism there is quite good, though, from a transmission recovery standpoint. It works more like a fuel cost type adjustment.","And then also, on the top side, 12.8% at our Prairie Wind project, which is also transmission, and Lisa will be talking later about the ROE trends and what we see relative to the kind of projects that we perform in Transmission. But still overall, a 10.6% overall in the utility group, and we're very happy about that.","So with the confirmation of that 4% to 6%, now I'll turn it over to Brian. He's going to go over the financial update, and then I'll rejoin you to wrap things up a little bit later. Thank you.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover today, so I'll jump right into it. And I'll give a comparison of GAAP and operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2000 -- for the fourth quarter in the year of 2012 versus '11.","GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $0.05 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating earnings, however, were $0.50 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Reconciliations between operating earnings and GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter include the Ohio plant impairments, the costs associated with the restructuring program, as well as a reserve associated with the U.K. windfall profits taxes issues from when we owned plants over in the U.K.","On the right-hand side of the chart. For the full year of 2012, GAAP earnings were $2.60 per share compared to $4.02 per share. And remember that in 2011, GAAP earnings included the $1.16 per share associated with issues related to the Texas capacity auction order.","Operating earnings in 2012 were $3.09 per share compared to $3.12 per share in 2011. In addition to the items that explain the quarterly differences between operating earnings and GAAP earnings, similarly to the annual component, there were an additional $0.02 per share associated with costs associated with the restructuring program, and there were also $0.02 per share associated with the Turk plant impairments that was due to the Texas regulatory cap on the cost recovery for the Turk power plant.","Let's turn to reconciliations between the fourth quarter of 2012 and full year operating earnings for 2012 as well. Many of the drivers that are the -- are the same for the annual as for the quarterly, so I'll focus my results -- or my discussion on the annual component. And we'll talk on the right-hand side of the page where the annual reconciliations are focusing mostly on the larger items. If you have any questions on some of the smaller items that I don't cover or on some of the quarterly reconciliations, we can either handle those in Q&A or with the IR team.","In 2012, like we said, we earned operating earnings of $3.09 per share for the year compared with $3.12 per share for 2011. The net effect of Ohio customer switching and capacity deferrals was negative $0.23 per share, and that included the loss of generation-related margins that were partially offset by capacity deferrals of the ESP. As of the end of 2012, 51% of load in Ohio had switched and an additional 3% was in a queue waiting to switch.","Higher depreciation and amortization accounted for negative $0.20 per share relative to 2011 and reflected plant additions, as well as increased depreciation rates at APCo and I&M.","Nonutility operations and parent were negative $0.17 per share from 2011, and reflected primarily 3 items: one is the early retirement of parent debt at the end of 2012; two are lower results from River Operations associated with challenging river and market conditions; and three was the impact of losing the production tax credits at our Texas wind farms.","Let me now focus on some of the major positive items that are comparisons of '11 to '12. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.08 per share, and came from multiple jurisdictions, including Appalachian Power and Ohio Power.","Fuel orders and other accounted for positive $0.19 per share and were due to 2 areas primarily: mostly, unfavorable fuel provisions from an Ohio order in 2011 that were reversed in 2012; and also some favorable fuel related orders in Appalachian Power that were partially offset by operating earnings components associated with the Texas capacity auction issue in 2011.","O&M was favorable $0.34 per share, and that was primarily due to cost control efforts and cost components that were eliminated in 2012 with the reversal of an Ohio 2011 order. All in all, O&M discipline in rate changes helped to offset other negative items that were comparisons to 2012 for operating earning.","Let's take a look now at normalized retail load trends for 2012. For the year we ended, total normalized retail load was down 0.8%. And for the quarter -- last quarter of last year, we were down fully 2%. Much of that 2% in the fourth quarter was described by industrial sales in the fourth quarter that were down 4.2%, and industrial overall for the year was down 0.9%. Industrial performance was driven by a large aluminum smelter in Ohio that reduced to 2\/3 production in the third quarter of last year. Excluding that customer, industrial load would've been down 1.6% for the fourth quarter and would have been flat for the year.","Taking a look at residential load. It was down 1.1% in the fourth quarter and down 1.6% for the year. Decreases in residential customer classes in the East part of our system were more than offset by customer accounts in the West part of our system. Unfortunately, and this happened throughout the year, average residential customer usage was down 1.8% for the year.","Looking at commercial loads. Commercial was down 0.4% for the quarter, but was actually up 0.3% for the year. This is the first time we've had annual increase in commercial load since the beginning of the recession in 2008. For the year, commercial load growth in the East and the West and Texas more than offset decreases in the East part of our system.","Before we move on to 2013 estimated load growth that's associated with our guidance, let's take a look at some key economic indicators for the AEP system. Unemployment for the AEP service territory is at 7.3% compared to 7.9% for the U.S. average. Both the AEP East and West unemployment rates are below the national averages at 7.6% and 7%, respectively. When we look at fourth quarter of 2012 year-on-year growth in GDP, AEP was up 2.7% compared to a national average of 1.5%. AEP East fourth quarter year-on-year load growth was up 2.2%, and growth in the AEP West part of our system was actually up more than twice the national average at 3.3%.","Quickly taking a look at what's in our guidance for 2013 guidance, let's look at overall load growth. It's anticipated to be up 0.5%, and industrial load is driving much of that, estimated to be up 1.8%. We'll have more detail on that on the next slide. Residential growth is anticipated to be down 0.4%, and commercial growth is estimated to be down 0.1%.","Let's take a look on Slide 20 about some specific identified load increases that are associated with industrial load. In Ohio, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Texas, we are anticipating significant load increases associated with shale gas developments and oil and gas productions.","Incremental monthly load of 149 gigawatt hours is expected to come online between March and October of this year. This represents specific customer requests for new or increased service. Our operating companies are investing capital and working within tight timelines to meet customer schedules for requested increases in load. Most of the increase that you see here is associated with gas pumping, compression and processing, and there's some also associated with coal mining expansions that are offsetting other coal mine reductions. Overall, shale gas expansion is a fundamental positive for the AEP service territory.","Let's now look at detailed 2013 guidance. As Nick said, we've established a guidance range for 2013 of $3.05 to $3.25 per share, the midpoint of that being $3.15, and we'll do a comparison of that against actual results of $3.09 for 2012. I'm only going to focus on the major items here.","The effective tax rate in 2012 was 31%, and we're anticipating it will be 35.8% in 2013. Key drivers of this include nontaxable AFUDC being down and bonus depreciation tax benefits being down as well. Both of these items were largely due to the Turk power plant coming online in 2012. AFUDC debt equity is also down $0.16 per share, and is also due to the Turk power plant coming online in 2012.","The net impact of Ohio customer switching and customer deferrals is down $0.15 per share, and includes increased switching partially offset by capacity deferrals.","Let's take a look on the positive side of the ledger now. Estimates for O&M costs, excluding those with earnings offsets, are anticipated to be favorable $0.02 per share relative to 2012. And earnings from Transcos and the Transmission JVs are anticipated to be positive $0.05 per share. Total earnings from this category is expected to be $67 million in 2014 -- 2013 or fully $0.14 per share. This is a 56% increase over 2012 and a 133% increase over 2011 results. Lisa will give you more detail following my presentation, but the anticipated load growth from this sector is truly impressive.","Nonutility and parent operations are estimated to be positive $0.24 relative to 2012, and this reflects 3 items as well: the early redemption of parent debt in 2012; improved results at River Operations that are expected from improved river conditions and market conditions; and improvement in generation and marketing that's associated with increased contributions from our retail sales.","Rate relief net of offsets is anticipated to be fully $0.45 per share positive relative to 2012. A lot of this has to do with the Turk power plant coming online, and much of the overall rate relief has already been secured. It's something that our operating company presidents take very seriously. A key component of our capital program is to get that capital with reflected in rates. And we have a credible track record of getting CapEx invested and incorporated into rates and getting recovery of the dollars that we spend.","In summary for 2013, challenges associated with normalized tax rates and with the loss of AFUDC, as well as challenges from Ohio, are more than offset from increased Transmission Operations, increased rate relief and continued O&M discipline, as well as getting back to normal in terms of River and Generation and Marketing.","Let's take a look at where we anticipate spending our capital in 2013, and much of this is illustrative in terms of a comparison to 2012. We anticipate spending $3.6 billion in CapEx and JV contributions in 2013, as compared to $3.1 billion in 2012. We are allocating capital wisely and within our financial means to maintain our investment grade credit ratings.","Let's look at some specific categories, and I think you'll get a sense for the fact that we are moving capital around and allocating it to places where we believe we have customer desire for that capital to spend -- to be spent, regulatory support and attractive regulatory environments.","Transmission, the Transcos, which are the Transcos and the JV investment opportunities, we're anticipating to spend $747 million in 2013, up from $505 million in 2012, an increase of 48%. We believe this is sound asset -- investment in asset allocation because these Transcos have forward test years, formula-based rates and attractive ROEs. And what does that meet mean to us? It means reduced regulatory lag, an efficient investment to earning cycle and attractive earned returns. Overall, this business means to us increase in transmission investments leads to increased grid reliability for customers, leads to increased returns for our shareholders.","Nuclear spend is another place where we're increasing our investment. We anticipate spending $256 million in 2013 as compared to $180 million in 2012, an increase of 42%. $215 million of that spend is associated with Cook lifecycle management that you heard Nick talk about. More than 80% of this spend in lifecycle management has been or will be preapproved with -- and will be recovered in trackers or formula-based rates with authorized returns anticipated to be greater than 10%.","New generation spending, as you'd anticipate, would be down as we brought the Turk power plant and the Dresden power plant online, and we're anticipating spending some of those dollars that we've been spending on new generation on environmental spend. A vast majority of that environmental spend is going to be spent in regulatory -- in regulated companies with constructive regulatory environments. Nick talked earlier about how we've modified the environmental spend between now and the end of the decade, how it's gone from $6 billion to $8 billion estimated, now down to 4% to 5% (sic) [$4 billion to $5 billion] estimated. A lot of that was associated with projects that we've canceled for economic or other reasons, Big Sandy, too, have been associated with environmental spend that's been pushed out because we found other ways to be compliant during this part of the decade, so we can push some of that spend farther out, perhaps in the next decade. And a lot of it's associated with a very thorough approach that we've had to testing and evaluation of technology. All of this has been designed to arrive at the most economic and efficient approach to compliance, while keeping the impact on customer rates low.","You've heard us talk a lot over the years about asset allocation and capital allocation. It's something that we take very, very seriously. We work hard year round as an executive management team to work with our operating company presidents, to work with our business unit leaders, to focus on getting capital to work where customers want it, where regulators support it, where we have attractive returns and reduced lag. And I think you'll see moving dollars into Transmission, into nuclear and into the regulated environmental component are all putting dollars to work where all 3 of those things are taking place. We take it very seriously, and will continue to do so.","So earlier this morning, you heard Nick articulate the 4% to 6% earnings per share targeted growth rate that we have, and I'd like to provide some detail on how we anticipate getting to that growth rate. We anticipate spending over the next year in -- incremental cumulative net increase in regulated net plant, property and equipment of $7.5 billion. That represents an increase over those 3 years of 6.9% on a compound annual growth basis. We're making the regulated investments. We're getting them into rate base. And we're earning reasonable returns on equity on this spend.","Let me take you through the 3 major categories that we've highlighted here, the first being the regulated vertically integrated utilities wherein we anticipate spending $4.4 billion over the next 3 years or 59% of the total. This is the CapEx that we put to work to keep lights on, to serve new customers, improve reliability and do things like the lifecycle management at the Cook nuclear power plant. We have largely supportive regulatory environments. In addition to base rate cases that we'll always be going in for, we'll have trackers associated with reliability and environmental spend, as well as trackers for a lot of our Transmission spend at a number of our jurisdictions. We invest in the infrastructure for the benefit of our customers. We earn a return on the capital for the investors that make that capital available to us.","The second major category where we'll be spending capital is in wires-only companies, where we'll be spending $1 billion of the total $7.5 billion or 13% of the total. This is 2 jurisdictions primarily, Texas and Ohio Wires. In both, we have favorable mechanisms for updating the rate base in generally supportive regulatory environments. In Ohio, we can recover the Transco investments through a rider with attractive returns, and we can get distribution investments recovered through a rider that has minimum regulatory lag and an ROE of greater than 10%.","In the Transmission Holding Company category, we anticipate spending about $2.1 billion over the 3 years or 28% of the total growth that we're talking about. Lisa will provide the detail later, but these projects either don't need approval, are approved and they have formula-based rates, forward-looking test years and attractive returns. In all, when you look at where we're putting these dollars to work to support the 4% to 6% growth, we're putting it to work in regulated companies, in regulated properties for the benefit of regulated customers with the support of positive regulatory environments. It's this way that we intend to grow the company by 4% to 6% earnings per share over time.","Okay. So we've given you some detail on the earnings. We've given you some detail on the CapEx and how we intend to grow earnings over time. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about how we intend to support this growth within the means of our balance sheet, cash flow and credit metrics.","Let's take a look at a particular area where I think we stand out relative to our peers, and that's in terms of qualified pension funding.","Over the last 3 years, we plowed $1.15 billion into our qualified pension funding between -- from 2009, we've moved our qualified pension funding from 74% to, as Nick said, at the end of January, 93.7%, all during a period of volatile equity markets and declining discount rates. As we've approached full funding, we've also derisked the asset portfolio of the qualified pensions. We now stand at a percentage of fixed income to total assets of 50%, with a goal of greater fixed income weighting as the funds improve. And to help protect against decrease in interest rates, the duration of the portfolio has been matched to the duration of the liabilities. In addition, in 2012, we offered lump sum payouts to term-vested employees, and were able to decrease both the assets and the liabilities of the qualified pension by $80 million.","Nick mentioned that we did make some changes to our retirement medical benefits for current employees in 2012. And by doing that, we were able to reduce our OPEB liability by $460 million or 21%. We anticipate that the combined pension and OPEB costs to decrease 2012 to 2013 by about $60 million pretax. It's clear that the management and the board of this company has seen the impact that volatile equity markets and declining discount rates can have on our pension and OPEB values. We've taken proactive steps to help reduce the exposure to our balance sheet and earnings while at the same time, maintaining our commitments to our current and future retirees.","Let's take a look at AEP's overall financial strength. Liquidity at the end of 2012 stood at about $3.1 billion. It was supported by sources of liquidity of about $3.5 billion that were primarily funded by our revolving credit facilities, and we had uses of that liquidity of about $400 million, which was primarily commercial paper to get us to the total of $3.1 billion. On February 13 of this year, we repriced, resized and extended our revolving credit facilities. So we increased total capacity from $3.25 billion to $3.5 billion, and we pushed the maturities of those revolving credit facilities out 1 year, so they now have maturities in the summer of 2016 and 2017, respectively.","We also obtained a 27-month unsecured delayed draw term loan facility associated with maturities that will happen at AEP Ohio in the near term and that will support our recapitalizations of AEP Ohio and AEP Genco. I know many of our banking partners are listening on the phone and are here today. I'd like to thank them for their support in these facilities and these renewals and extensions that we've had and let them know that their faith in this management team and this company is well placed. So thank you so much. We do have ample sources of reasonably priced liquidity, and like I said, very, very supportive banking relationships.","On the credit metrics side, we have solidly B credit metrics. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating. In September, S&P completed its review of AEP's credit and maintained the company's business risk profile at excellent -- as excellent. In the recent past, in the last 10 days, Moody's has recently reaffirmed the ratings of 4 of our key operating companies, and they've highlighted the generally supportive regulatory environment that we have and the need for upcoming rate cases, which we've talked to you about in some detail.","Our balance sheet is strong. Our credit metrics solidly support the BBB corporate credit rating, and management has demonstrated a commitment to maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings. That commitment is unwavering and continues to go forward.","So we've talked about earnings. We've talked about growth, capital allocation and all those things. And I think the obvious question many of you might have is, how are you going to finance the growth that you're talking about? Nick identified earlier today that we anticipate spending $3.6 billion in CapEx in 2012 (sic) and $3.8 billion in each of 2014 and 2015. On this slide, we've laid out cash flows from operations, required capital needs. And what we're highlighting here is cash inflows over the next 3 years.","Significant cash inflows are going to come from bonus depreciation, and we've laid that out on the slide. And then we're also anticipating significant cash securitizations in addition to some of the equity inflows that we anticipate from just the regular DRIP and the employee 401k program. Altogether, over the next 3 years, those 3 items are going to bring in $2.4 billion of cash that we can put to work growing this company.","We are committed to maintaining those investment grade credit ratings. With the cash that we have coming in, we fully believe we'll be able to do that. If things change going forward, we're not with our back against the wall. We can modify our CapEx plans, whether it's on the transmission side, whether it's in the wires-only side or whether it's in our integrated utilities.","We've not accounted for in this future bonus depreciation. Congress seems to keep re-upping that because it scores very well in the budgeting process. And we've not put on here securitizations that could happen going forward, and there are some of those that are on the horizon, but they are speculative enough now so we've not put them on the chart. So there are pluses and minuses that we can make to this plan as we move forward. But against the backdrop of the cash flows from operations, the strength of our balance sheet that we have going into this incremental spend that we have and all of the cash that's coming in from those 3 items that I mentioned, we're very confident in our ability to fund this growth and this capital expansion without having to issue incremental equity during the 3-year period.","Let me try and wrap things up here as quickly as I can. Nick talked about some of the operational and financial strides that we've made over the last year. On the operational side, bringing Turk and Dresden online, the safety accomplishments that Nick identified, as well as getting some difficult but workable orders in Ohio that allow us to transition to restructuring as we go forward. On the financial side, we had both completed and in-flight securitizations, the refinancing of the parent debt and all of the progress that we've made in terms of funding the pensions and the OPEBs.","You've heard us talk about capital allocation. We talk about that as a management team all the time. We spend a huge amount of our time and effort on that, and we're doing what we said we're going to do. We're going to put capital to work where customers want it, where our regulators support it, where we have reduced lag and where we have attractive ROEs. We've been doing this. The investment review committees are focused on it. We're going to continue doing this. And you've seen from our 2012 to 2013 comparison, it's working.","We have a strong balance sheet with strong investment -- with solidly investment grade credit metrics and a commitment by the management team and the board to maintain those. Like I said just before, we don't anticipate incremental equity needs to fund the capital plans that we're going to put in place over the next 3 years.","Nick identified a targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings. This is fully supported by earnings from our regulated operations. And we anticipate a 4% to 6% earnings growth rate supported by investment in our regulated operations, as I laid out some detail for you previously.","In all, we have a healthy American Electric Power. We're providing a vital service to our customers, and we're providing a total return proposition to our shareholders of 8% to 10%.","With no further ado, I'll turn it over to Lisa Barton, who will take us through her plans for how she intends to grow the transmission part of our company. Thank you.","Lisa M. Barton","Can you guys hear me okay? All right. There are 3 items in particular that I'd like to cover with you today. First and foremost is to summarize our 2012 performance and talk about how that performance will really position us for the future. Secondly, I'm going to highlight the breadth of our transmission investments, basically give you a breakdown of the projects that make up our long-range plan, and these are the projects that are really going to propel our growth in the future. And finally, I'm going to address the subject of FERC ROEs and incentives and review where our performance has been in that space.","So 2012 was an extremely positive year for AEP Transmission. Our earnings were 50% higher than they were in 2011. We secured approval of our West Virginia Transco. And why that is so crucially important is because that serves as the foundation for our Transco growth. As you may recall, AEP Transmission Holding Company is the parent of our state-based Transcos, ETT, ETA, our project-based joint ventures, as well as our new competitive affiliates with Great Plains Energy, Transource.","Our Transcos ended the year with $373 million of plant in service with a net PP&E of $744 million. In 2013, we're projecting to have $770 million in plant in service with a net income of $47 million. ETT reached $880 million in 2012 and is on target to be self-funded in 2013, with a projected income of $25 million. And that represents AEP Transmission's Holdco share in that investment.","Some of the things that we're particularly proud of in 2012 is the fact that we were able to be ahead of target in terms of our in-service assets, and this was during a time where we had both our own crews as well as the contract labor crews that we rely so heavily on to get our assets in service, deployed to the restoration efforts in the East in support of the damage caused by Sandy. One of the things just to note in the transmission businesses is that our outage windows to really get these assets in service are often in the spring and more often in the fall. So fall is a crucial time for us in terms of deploying capital.","In 2012, we also secured $1.7 billion worth of new investment opportunities through the 3 RTOs that we are currently operating in, $1.25 billion of which is in PJM alone. And as Nick mentioned earlier, the transmission system is very much the backbone of the grid. This allocation of the $1.25 billion is very much tied to the region-wide retirements in PJM, which would be about 14 gigawatts between now and 2015.","In 2012, we also deployed new technology and improved our standardization, basically with the intent to improve our ability to move capital more efficiently, deploy it more efficiently to meet in-service dates. And the in-service dates, we really needed to speed up to address the growing shale gas loads that we're having in our territory. It's no longer a situation where you can say to the customer that will be -- it'll take us 2 years to get you interconnected. We really have to do that in a very short period of time. So we used a number of technologies to make that happen. We also use it to manage our RTO outage windows, as I mentioned earlier; those are critical to our success. And finally, to reduce costs to our customers. Aggregating our growth under the AEP Transmission Holdco is providing greater visibility and transparency for these investments.","On Slide 31, I'm going to talk a little bit about what our outlook is with respect to transmission. Certainly, diversification was key to our success in 2012. We're managing a large number of projects in a number of states. And what this slide attempts to do is to really break down that growth for you.","So in our long-range plan for our transmission investments that we have across our system, and so this includes everything that we're doing in ETT, the Transcos, as well as the operating companies, we have nearly 500 new or enhanced stations, just under 22,000 MVA of new transformation capacity, nearly 2,000 miles of new transmission lines and just under 4,000 miles of rebuilt transmission lines.","This really makes us unique. I'd really like to pause here for a second because we are -- we do not have a portfolio that is reliant on a small handful of projects. We have a portfolio that is spread really across the 11 states that we serve, as well as Missouri and Kansas where we have our Prairie Wind project as well as our Transource development efforts. So we're not as susceptible to that individual project risk that you might see if somebody has issues with getting siting approval and things like that. As Brian mentioned earlier, these are 2 approved projects, they're projects that are completely under our control, meaning that execution is also within our control. This, coupled with the diversity of the portfolio, puts us in a very strong position for executing well in 2013 and beyond.","From a local reliability standpoint, we're replacing a lot of our obsolete voltage classes, the 46 kV system, the 88 kV system. And as you probably have heard, not a lot of people are talking about those voltage classes anymore. These rebuilt lines really serve as the ability to better serve our shale gas loads that we're seeing all across our territory, as well as improved local reliability to our operating company customers.","We have the largest transmission system in the country. Again, as Nick mentioned earlier, this is the backbone of our system. It's going to fuel our investment opportunities and provide benefits to our customers as well as earnings growth for our investors.","On Slide 31, I really wanted to pause for a moment and talk about FERC returns and incentives. Certainly, it's been depressed for quite a bit over the past month or so. And as you can see, our transmission company ROEs, these are for our Transcos, are pretty much in the middle of both the PJM and SPP ROEs. One thing to note about our ROEs is that they were either approved or settled within the past 5 years. So they're fairly recent ROEs. They were all calculated under the current median methodology that's applied by FERC to single-entity developers.","One thing to keep in mind is that there are 2 types of filings. There are utility-triggered filings, which are 205 filings, and that's where the utility basically seeks to set or modify an established rate. In those cases, the burden of proof is on the utility to set the rate. The second type is, of course, the 206 complaint, where a third party basically needs to establish that the rates are unjust and unreasonable. And so the one distinction that I think is important in this space for folks to keep in mind is that this process can, in essence, result in different outcomes based on who has the burden of proof in those cases.","But I think one of the things that's most important to remember when we think about FERC is that FERC is open to utilities modifying their rates. You can go in at any time after you have an established rate and modify that rate. This, coupled with FERC's track record of supporting transmission, makes us comfortable with investing in this space over the long term.","I'd like to talk a little bit about incentives and where we are positioned in that space. So FERC provided greater clarity with respect to their position on incentives with their recently issued policy statement. And in that policy statement, they said a couple of things. They basically said that they expected utilities to pursue non-ROE incentives first, things like abandonment, things like return of construction work in progress, hypothetical capital structures. And then they said you really need to tie the incentive to the individual project risk, not the company's risk, the individual project risk.","And they also indicated that they would view favorably incentives that were tied to developers who sought to contain project costs. And what was interesting is in that policy statement, they actually referenced the AEP Exelon project, RITELine, where we basically tied incentives to the forecasted cost of the project at the time of RTO approval.","So what does this mean for us? It basically means that we have a proven track record with respect to incentives. We view credibility as the key to that success, not only for the investment community, but for our dealings with our regulators, including FERC. Without credibility, you really don't have anything.","So FERC wants to differentiate between projects. In terms of our track record, we ask for incentives only when the project risks warrant it. If you think back to the slide before, we are rebuilding a tremendous amount of projects. We are investing in thousands of miles of new projects, but there's only really a handful of projects that we've actually thought to get incentives on. And because of that, when we ask for it, we have a proven track record of getting those. Our Transource order is probably a good one to note where what we asked for, we received, and it was basically issued just before FERC's issuance of the new incentive policy.","So lastly, what I'd like to cover is the fact that we are delivering on our commitments, and delivering on them in 2012 and in 2011 was key to our success over the past 2 years. We're growing a new business, but this is by far not a start-up. AEP has over 100 years experience in building transmission. We operate ourselves as a separate business unit with nearly 2,000 employees that are dedicated to providing service to not only our operating companies, but our Transcos and our joint ventures with which we serve. So we're taking this experience and deploying it in support of transmission growth.","By the end of 2013, we'll be doubling our net PP&E to the tune of $1.4 billion. We're deploying significant capital in support of transmission, which provides benefits to our customers and earnings growth to investors. By 2015, AEP Transmission Holdco expects to contribute $0.36 towards AEP's earnings, making it a significant increase from what we've contributed in the past.","Our long-range plan is comprised of known and well-defined projects. I really can't emphasize this key enough. These are all projects that are included in our capital plans. They're all projects that we have underway. Because we have them underway, we're very well positioned to execute them; because we have these projects over the breadth of our territory and the diversity in the number, it really gives us a platform for future growth that is, again, unique to AEP.","Also, as Nick mentioned and Brian mentioned as well, these are projects that make up our forecasted earnings per share contribution. There are additional transmission opportunities on top of it. What I've highlighted is just the stuff that we've got in the pipeline right now. So additional uplift potential includes the opportunities provided by the various joint ventures that we continue to pursue, such as RITELine, Pioneer and of course, our competitive affiliate with Great Plains Energy, Transource.","In closing, we see ourselves as stewards of the largest transmission system in the country. In turn, this is fueling our need to invest in transmission and fueling what will be what we deliver to the investment community. Transmission is the resource that fuels our economy, energy markets and furthers regional and local reliability, and that's going to be the foundation for our growth over the next several years.","With that, I will turn over the microphone to Chuck Zebula.","Charles E. Zebula","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a discussion of the principles that Nick has laid out for the unregulated businesses at AEP.","The first thing that Nick has talked about is to mitigate risk, and that's going to be done through our participation in the capacity markets, the retail energy markets and the wholesale energy markets, as well as how we operate, invest and finance this company going forward. The second principle is don't get ahead of the cash flows in this business. We intend to run this business with a CapEx funded by internally generated cash flow. Thirdly, conservative capitalization, maintain an investment grade look in this business. It's important in terms of how you do business with counterparties, and that must be maintained. And lastly, to make this business look as regulated as possible.","So where are we in the process? In terms of the regulatory process, Nick had mentioned that the corporate separation order is in rehearing at the PUCO. We have applications for corporate separation in before the FERC, with an effective date of 1\/1\/14 that we've asked for. Secondly is in terms of integration. We have generation that has operated in a 4- or 5-company pool for decades and decades. We need to extract that generation, make it competitive, combine it with a retail business that is relatively young, but also complement it with a wholesale marketing and trading business that is mature, competent and experienced.","On Page 35, you'll find a lot of information, and I'll start with the bar graph up in the upper left corner. So you'll notice 3 colors to the bar in 2013: blue, yellow and I guess, a reddish color, and they represent different things, of course. The red represents capacity that's going to retire. That's about 1,920 megawatts. The yellow represents capacity that is planned to be transferred. It's about 2,450 megawatts. That represents our Amos 3 capacity as well as the Mitchell plant capacity. There are applications to transfer that capacity to our regulated affiliates, Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. And of course, the blue represents the residual capacity, if you will, that will remain in AEP generation resources. That's about 8,900 megawatts. So 2014, the transferred capacity disappears, right. And in 2015, there will be retirements of the remaining capacity in red.","So for the 8,900 megawatts, if you look now down to the pie chart, that represents the fuel profile for this business. You'll note that 65% is coal, it is predominantly controlled; 35% gas. There's combined cycle and combustion turbine capability. There is a small run-of-river hydro unit that's on the Ohio River. And it spans the capability, the operational flexibility, baseload, intermediate and peaking capacity, with the Darby combustion turbine units, representing about 6% of the capacity.","Moving on to the map. In real estate, it's all about location, location, location. And really, from a field perspective, it really is about location, especially when you're dealing with coal. And if you start in this map at our Cardinal plant, which is located in Wheeling, West Virginia, get on a boat and take a ride down the Ohio River till you get to Louisville, you will pass 4,600 megawatts of coal capacity that is located on the river. And you got to be looking at the Ohio side. Don't look at the West Virginia side because you'll be looking at other plants.","So if you look at the Ohio side of the river, you'll see 4,600 megawatts of capacity. That is basically AEP generation resources. The backbone is the river, right. The river access gives us access to a wide variety of fuels that are available on the river. The plants have much flexibility in the kinds of fuels they can burn, and it has the great advantage of transportation by the river and barge industry.","Moving into the other coal plants. Our Muskingum River plant, which is turned green. It's because that plant, our Muskingum River units 1 through 4 will retire, they're part of the 1,900 megawatts, and Muskingum River 5 is under consideration for a refueling to natural gas.","And just east of Columbus, Ohio, our Conesville plant. That plant is served by rail, the Ohio Central Railroad goes into Conesville. It's about 1,140 megawatts. It's dependent primarily on local coal sources. It's a rather difficult coal location, and it's much more expensive to source coal and deliver coal into this rail-served plant than the plants on the river that we talked about earlier.","On the gas plants, our Lawrenceburg plant in Indiana near Cincinnati, it's is about 1,200 megawatts. Our Waterford plant in Southeast Ohio, about 840 megawatts. All on good pipeline capacity locations. Also, the Darby plant in Central Ohio is fired by 100 combustion turbines, 12,000 Btu\/kWh heat rates, provides peaking capacity as well for the portfolio.","The next slide, on Page 36, represents where these plants stack up in terms of the current market conditions that we are in, and if I could spend a time just talking about the graph. You'll note that this is a supply curve of the capacity versus its fuel and consumables cost, the cost to run the emission control equipment. And the lines represent basically where the off-peak market is, the around-the-clock market and the peak market. Basically, the peak market is around $40 average, around-the-clock in the mid-30s and the off-peak in the high 20s. And you'll note that about 4,600 megawatts is at or below the off-peak line, which represents all of the river-served coal plants.","Not only do the river-served coal plants give you great locational advantage for delivering coal, they're also advantaged to delivering the consumable materials that you need to run the environmental equipment: the limestone, the lime, the urea. All the things that we need to deliver into the plant to run the environmental equipment are also delivered by barge. In between the off-peak and the around-the-clock line are the intermediate units representing the combined cycle capacity, as well as the rail-served coal plants. And of course, at the top, above the peak line, are the peaking capacity plants, the Darby plant we talked about earlier.","So the generation from this fleet, expected to be in the range of 40 to 45 million megawatt hours against the current market conditions. That puts coal capacity factors in the low 60s to mid-60s; combined cycles in the 40% to 50% range; the combustion turbines, 3% to 5% range, for a total capacity factor for this fleet in the mid-50s range. So it's very competitive, and it is about location.","Turning to the next slide. It's a rather busy slide, but it's important to understand this slide to understand the revenue opportunities available to the new company as we go forward. So let's start with the row that says capacity and go across the timeline. As you will remember, AEP and its regulated affiliates, for many years, participated in the FRR capacity markets, and PJM was a self-provided capacity market. And that obligation goes through May 31, 2015. While if corporate separation occurs on January 1, 2014, AEP Generation Resources is obligated to provide that FRR resource back to the regulated affiliates as -- to meet their requirements in PJM. And that revenue will be determined according to the recently issued ESP by the PUCO. That's the $189 per megawatt day, the RSR payment. Those revenue streams are available to AEP Generation Resources for providing that FRR capacity back to the regulated affiliate.","Then on June 1, 2015, you'll note that the box turns blue. Blue basically represents market exposure. And those assets were bid into the PJM RPM market in the last auction last year. They did clear the market, and they'll be participating in that market going forward as well.","Moving to the bottom box, which says off-system energy, when you look in 2013, it says BAU, business as usual. The 4-company pool is still in place. Basically, the generation in Ohio is still participating in that 4-company pool, and off-system sales are calculated or results are recorded as they always have been historically at AEP.","When you get to 2014, AEP Generation Resources, as its own company, still has the obligation to serve energy to customers who haven't switched from Ohio Power. And then the excess energy that's available can be sold in the retail and wholesale markets. And the energy we provide to the AEP Ohio customers will be covered according to the fuel clause that has been in place and is referenced to in the ESP.","When you get to 2015 and beyond, all of the energy is available to sell in the retail and wholesale markets for AEP Generation Resources.","When we look at the revenue opportunity in 2014 against capacity revenues and potential energy margins, we believe about 80% of the revenue opportunity or gross margin has been determined. And when you get to 2015, between the FRR obligation, the RPM capacity and the energy opportunity, we think about 60% of that gross margin opportunity has been determined.","Moving through the line that says SSO load -- you switched too quick, Julie. I should point out that there are actually 4 auctions that will occur. A 10% auction that will occur this coming year. It will likely occur in the third quarter. That's a 10% slice of system auction. In 2014, there will be 2 incremental 25% auctions, bringing a total for a 60% slice of system. The remaining energy or customers that are at AEP Ohio are auctioned. And then in the summer of 2014, the remaining 40% will be auctioned effective January 1, '15. So all of these auctions cumulatively have a delivery date through May 31, 2015.","So one of the questions we've been asked is where do we plan to place this energy. As I talked about earlier, this fleet will produce about 40 million to 45 million megawatt hours. And in 2014, it's pretty clear where these opportunities are going to be placed. The first tranche is what we call competitive retail customers. As you know, we've been active in the retail markets, particularly in Ohio. We think about 25% to 30% of that 40 million to 45 million megawatt hours can be placed in that market. Last year, we served 7.5 million megawatt hours. About 60% of that was in Ohio. We are focusing on that opportunity as we roll into next year. The next tranche up is the unswitched AEP Ohio customers. That's what I talked about earlier. That's the load that we still need to serve and provide energy to those customers according to how fuel will be recovered in the fuel clause.","The next 2 boxes up represent our participations in AEP Ohio auctions, as well as other auctions throughout PJM, muni and wholesale customer load, as well as financial instruments that we may enter into in order to hedge the output. And then lastly, a block on the top, that is short term. That could be the hedge, spot, balance of month. It could be balance of year, depending on the opportunity and where we see opportunity. So we're looking at a portfolio of options to place those megawatts -- megawatt hours into the various markets for next year. So when you get into 2015 and '16, this will look a lot different because the unswitched, the SSO load will go away. We'll have additional opportunities between the retail and the wholesale markets. And we are focused on opportunities longer term so that we can deal with muni and co-op customers as well. This is a relationship business dealing with muni and co-op customers, something that AEP has always had a good-standing reputation. And really, credit quality is extremely important on both sides of that equation.","These markets tend to have a lot more activity when there's some urgency in the market from the perspective of rising capacity prices, maybe an expansion of the heat rate complex, maybe fuel volatility, because this is a rather risk-averse group and they like to contract for some period and take the risk off in that manner.","So in the past, we've historically served several thousand megawatts in this category. And just a couple of weeks ago, we extended a contract with 7 municipal customers in the Midwest into the 2018 timeframe. So this is representative of what we believe will be a continued risk aversion sought by that group, and they are ready to do business with a willing and reputable, creditworthy counterparty like AEP.","Also, in our deregulated book, there are several large muni deals that we have in that are currently backed by market purchases. So this market is available, we dedicate staff to it, and we're very focused on it as well.","So in summary, on terms of the energy sales opportunity, there really is a portfolio approach, looking at both the retail and the wholesale markets, seeking an optimum result that will align with our goals and our appetite for risk, as Nick has laid out for us.","On the right side of Page 38, just a few comments about AEP Energy. AEP Energy is our competitive retail electric supplier. In 2012, probably, the marquee event was the acquisition of BlueStar Energy. BlueStar Energy is based in Chicago, Ohio. We run our retail group still out of Chicago. In 2012, they served 168,000 retail customers. As I mentioned early, we served about 7.5 million megawatt hours in 7 states, primarily focused in Ohio, where the retail markets have opened up considerably. It has been profitable in its first year. And it's important because all of the retail activity currently has to be backed up by market purchases. Clearly, as we go forward, one of the objectives will be to not back that with market purchases but, of course, back that with our generation as we go forward. About 87% of that load was in the C&I space and 13% in residential.","So the 2013 plan is relatively simple for AEP Energy. It's really focused on the margin opportunity. As Nick mentioned, we're not looking to be a national player in retail or some grand strategy to be the biggest retailer out there. But there is margin opportunity that is greater than you can observe in the wholesale markets, and that opportunity is important in this low price environment. So providing that hedging opportunity for the generation is extremely important, as well as we'll focus on growth in our traditional footprint areas where AEP has traditionally done business, the likes of PJM and the Midwest.","Turning to the next page, capital expenditures and environmental control profile. So the chart that has a lot of green, I think we probably ran out of green ink when we printed this. But green is good. And when you look at this lineup of our coal-fired power plants across the top, the first row represents our investments in NOx controls. All of the units have SCRs, except Conesville 5 and 6. No SCR is currently planned at that unit because we believe we can comply with the current rules without making that investment. SCRs began to be built in 2001. Particularly, the first one that was built here was Gavin, so we have over a decade of experience in terms of operating this kind of equipment. And those SCRs were primarily built for the NOx SIP call. For those of us who've been around for a while, remember that in 2003 and '04. And later, for the CAR rules, where some of the other additions were added.","Moving to the next row, represents our SO2 controls. All of the units have FGD, except for Muskingum River 5. Some of these are newer FGDs, such as at Cardinal, Conesville 4, Stuart and the OVEC capacity. I believe they all have JBR retrofits on them. Yes. And the other scrubbers at Gavin, Conesville 5 and 6 and Zimmer were made in the early '90s, and actually, at Conesville, in the late '70s. Those scrubbers were built either for NSPS requirements or for the Clean Air Act amendments of Phase 1 requirements that went into 1995 for SO2.","Moving down to the mercury and particulate line, you'll notice a yellow on Gavin. On the scrubber dewatering circuit at Gavin, there are centrifuges that are not quite as good as bell presses in terms of giving the quality of effluent you need to meet the requirements of HAPs MACT. So we may need to do some additional polishing in that step, either through some polymers or chemicals or some ACI investment as well. At Conesville 5 and 6, we do plan an ACI investment as well and are looking at deeper washing coal there as well. And at Muskingum River 5, there's an opportunity for us to refuel that unit with gas. It's a discretionary investment, and we certainly will only make that investment if the market is willing to reward us for that investment.","In terms of the average CapEx for this fleet, over the 2014 to '16 time frame, we think that it needs about $180 million per year average over the next 3 years. That's an annual amount per year. About $100 million of that is ongoing maintenance CapEx in landfill extensions, and about $80 million of that is environmental. Most importantly, we think that the ongoing capital requirements in that period are funded by internally generated cash flow.","Turning to the next slide, in terms of finance, there are really only 3 words that I have to say here. One is conservative. And by that, I mean conservative capitalization, 60% to 65% equity layer and maintaining an investment-grade look, although we have no current plan of getting the unit initially rated. The second word is transitional. As Brian mentioned, the transitional financing is in place. The $1 billion 27-month term loan is in place. That will be used to fund Ohio Power maturities. And basically, the permanent financing at AEP Generation Resources will fund the takeout of that bank loan sometime before the 27-month period is up. And lastly is adequate. And by that, I mean adequate liquidity. There's a deliberate plan to upsize our credit facilities by $250 million, the last time, and the time before that, an incremental $250 million, basically a $500 million adder to our credit facilities to basically fit this business and its collateral needs into the liquidity requirements of the company.","So what have I told you today and what are we focusing on? Really, it's about integration, integrating these generating assets with, again, a relatively young retail effort but a mature, experienced wholesale marketing and trading team, consistent with the operational goals, the financial goals, the credit goals that we have as a corporation and certainly aligned with those corporate objectives.","This year, we're actually focusing on the things we control. We're not running the generation in an unregulated market today, but we're focusing on the things we can control. I can't control the capacity markets. I can't control gas prices. I wish I could. But nonetheless, the cost profile at the plants. Mark McCullough and his team are doing a great job looking, as Nick had mentioned, through some of the lean processes and looking at how we do the work, what it cost to do the work and making a concerted effort to make sure that these plants, from a cost perspective, can be competitive in the market.","Certainly, we can control how we invest in these assets and how we operate them. There's opportunities to think about minimum load and how much minimum load you can run during the off-peak period. Those are important things that we're looking at in terms of how this fleet may need to operate differently in the competitive market. We're obviously focused on the fuel and consumables contracts; the energy sales opportunity; again, that portfolio approach focused on both the retail and the wholesale opportunity in the area where we do business; our service company cost; how much cost or how much service do we really need from the service company as we move into the unregulated affiliate; and of course, the financing and capitalization plan that I mentioned earlier.","So I know all of you are very interested in this business. And we certainly -- as information continues to become available, we're certainly willing to continue the dialogue and disclosure with you as we march down this path in this business.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Nick, who will wrap it up. Thank you.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thank you, Chuck. Thanks, Lisa, Brian.","Now I hope that you've heard the story today about the things we're trying to achieve from a growth perspective. But I also trust that you sense the depth of our management team. These people who are working on these major initiatives for our corporation are stellar people that can really get the job done, and they will. So to wrap up the activity this morning, certainly, we're a clear regulated business model. I think that's happening over time. We're going through the corporate separation piece now, but we've done a lot to reinforce the foundation of this company in terms of a strong balance sheet. We have a competitive path that's cleared out for us in Ohio, and we don't anticipate any equity needs associated with the capital reallocation that's occurred over time. And we also, with a 4% to 6% earnings growth, primarily driven by transmission but our regulated business as well, is clearly a positive for AEP as we go forward. This management team has been proven as battle-tested over the last year. We've been through a lot of issues, and I'm sure when we review the 2012 list of things that we've clarified, it has been a process where this management team has grown closer and are really focused on making sure that now we can reinvigorate our sales to focus on growth. And it's actually a good position for the AEP management team to be in and a good position for the AEP shareholder to be in.","So again, thank you very much for your time, and we'll entertain questions at this point. Brian, if you'd like to come up, and then obviously, we have the others here to answer any questions if they become too specific.","Question-and-Answer Session","Nicholas K. Akins","Okay, any questions?","Unknown Analyst","Just on sort of on the post -- after this year, 2014 and beyond, when we're looking at the regulated strategy -- I'm looking at Page 48 and Slide 23. And when you look at sort of where your earned ROE is and your authorized ROE is, how should we think about how you're going to be growing that business? I mean, it seems like it's a regulated growth strategy. I'm just trying to get a sense, will you guys be going in for rate cases? Will this -- will you be filling it in through O&M or something? How should we think about the 4% to 6% growth in light of sort of the ROE environment? And if you could just elaborate a little bit on that. I just wasn't completely clear. Excluding transmission, which I think you guys explained very well.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, so obviously, we target ROEs continuing to be north of 10%. And as well, the invested capital that we have through this -- the PP&E graph that we showed, those are legitimate investments that Brian went through that, really, in my opinion, is block-and-tackle spending with good opportunities for regulatory recovery. And historically, we've recovered those very well. The thing we have to work on, obviously, is being closer from a coincident standpoint of recovery. And that, of course, we're working on in those various jurisdictions. We have a multitude of trackers of deferred type of expenses that we can recover in the future. And the regulatory situation in each of the states is such that we're going through a repositioning exercise that keeps our O&M flat, and that's more of an opportunity to continue with capital investment, and the rate impacts are mitigated as a result. Brian, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.","Unknown Analyst","So just to sort of understand this, I mean, in other words, you guys are in a regulatory environment where we're not probably going to be, at least for some of these situations where you seem to be earning above the authorized, where those are going to be reset. Or I mean, is that how we should think about it? Without going obviously into -- you guys have so many jurisdictions, it would take all day, but just sort of -- is that sort of how we should think about it in terms of...","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, that's the strength of the diversity of the system. You see the Western properties as you see a higher return on equity in those areas, but it's because of the timing of rate cases and the investment of capital. So we'll continue to invest in those jurisdictions. You'll probably see those come down a little bit. You'll see O&M and others come up as a result, and the overall return across the corporation will still be north of that 10%.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Then just in terms of the transfer, the Genco transfer into regulated, what's the sensitivity can you give us if, in fact, worst-case scenario, that just doesn't happen? Let's say, for whatever reason, they don't want them. How should we think about the sensitivity towards the ongoing earnings growth if, for some reason, that pending regulatory situation doesn't go out as planned and it isn't transferred into a regulated asset?","Nicholas K. Akins","Well, keep in mind that these companies are already paying for that capacity. They already have a call on that generation. So a distinction, I think, for AEP is, for APCO in Kentucky, since they are paying for that capacity, it's merely a transfer at net book. And we can demonstrate and have demonstrated in the cases that those transfers are positive for customers in the long term. So I don't sense a big issue when those particular jurisdictions -- the plant is located in West Virginia. And certainly, from a Kentucky perspective, they need the capacity, and they're very interested in coal. The coal comes from Kentucky and APCO-related mines. So there's more to the equation than just thinking about are we trying to transfer a plant from out of state into those various jurisdictions. So I don't even get to that second point of the premise of your question. But if that were to happen, certainly, we'd have to deal with it on the unregulated side, just be more that we have to hedge, but they're going to need capacity. So unless they want to leave themselves open to the market, which typically, those jurisdictions have not done because we're clearly still FRR in those jurisdictions, then we'd have more opportunities to sell that capacity, and it could be a PPA. But I don't see it going in that direction. Brian?","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So in other words, you see it so unlikely that you don't want to give us any sense? I mean, really, this is so unusual, it's such an outlier situation that we shouldn't have to worry about it, I guess.  So I'm just wondering, is there any sensitivity we should get to? I'm just wondering, you're sort of applying for this. Just wondering what the range of outcome could be. I'm not suggesting that's likely. I'm just wondering...","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, we don't see that happening. Obviously, a part of the discussion will be what the transfer price would be for the assets and those types of things. But even the net book that we show for the transfer of those assets is a positive benefit for customers. And clearly, I mean, look at Big Sandy, for example. If we put the scrubber on Big Sandy, it'd increase rates in Kentucky Power by 30%. But by not doing that and this capacity being transferred over, it's an 8% increase. So it's those kinds of things, I think, that you're measuring against. So I'm feeling -- I continue to be confident that we'll be able to transfer those assets.","Unknown Analyst","Two questions not really related to each other. First, on the earnings bridge slide, the $0.45 of rate relief, if I gross that up for taxes and then kind of just multiply it by your share count, it's about $300 million, $325 million or so on a pretax basis. Can you just walk us through what the biggest components of that $300-plus million of rate relief is? You said most of it's already been granted. I'm just looking for the big move-the-needle items.","Brian X. Tierney","Certainly getting Turk into rate base are large components of that. What we talked about in terms of I&M and the recently completed rate case there is a large component of that. In Ohio, the rate stability rider is a significant component of that. And like I said, a lot of it's associated with Turk coming into play. So it's a formula base rate extension in Louisiana. Those are primarily it. It's Louisiana, Texas, I&M and Ohio and all those components you're familiar with, Michael.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And I'll follow up off-line. The second question and this may be a Lisa one. We're seeing in other jurisdictions, like New England, like in Colorado, a regulated jurisdiction. We're seeing 206 complaints at the FERC regarding base ROEs. Just curious, haven't seen that yet in the SPP, haven't seen it yet in PJM. It's coming, right? I mean, the intervener groups all talk to each other, so it's just kind of a matter of time. Just curious for your high-level viewpoint of how that plays out over time.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, and certainly, there's a difference in the burden of proof, a 205 versus a 206. And Lisa, you may want to comment on this question, please.","Lisa M. Barton","Sure. A lot of what you're seeing also is the fact that some utilities have entered into agreements with their states to go in annually. And I think PG&E fell into this category, so they have to go in for a 205 filing every year, which gives the commission staff an opportunity to launch a 206 to kind of get that debate going a little bit more lively. I think one of the things to just keep in mind is the fact that, anytime you hear stuff like what we heard in New England about what FERC's staff was saying, they are very much like an attorney general intervener. And so they are kind of anarchists in the midst there. And it is the commission who would ultimately decide on what is that range of reasonable. So that range of reasonable is still very broad, and you saw that in the New England proceeding. So it's really going to be up to either what the utilities decide to settle on, or it will be based on what the commission determines. But again, I think the good things are that FERC is very open to a reopener. Or alternatively, if you're hit with a 206 complaint, you can also sit there and agree not to go back and therefore, maybe settle a higher ROE. Ultimately, it's going to depend on where do long-term interest rates go because the longer that they stay at a lower level, the potential for more pressure on that. But it is very time-sensitive. If we were to go in with -- we have one that's currently before FERC right now with Transource. If we went in 6 months from now, that number would be very different. We really only have 2 interveners, for example, in that case, and that is an SPP case.","Nicholas K. Akins","I think the key for us is the focus on no-regrets transmission projects. And then secondly, if FERC continues, which they have espoused to, they want to continue with transmission investment, then regardless of what happens, they will still trade at a premium associated with the retail regulated space. So that's why we continue to be bullish on transmission.","Unknown Analyst","Brian, just a couple questions on the slides to review on Page 21. Nonutility parent, the $0.24 incremental positive, can you just review again what the biggest key drivers are of that? And then I have 1 or 2 other questions.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. it's the fact that we won't have the early redemption of the parent debt expense as we did in 2012. It's River Ops coming back to a more normal rate of earnings in 2013, and it's the Generation and Marketing increases associated with competitive retail.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. My second question was on the sources and uses of cash slide on Page 26. Your target growth rate -- you haven't given an earnings guidance range for '15, but you've given a growth rate expectation. I'm just wondering how you could see earnings growth in that magnitude with CFO being relatively flat. Is there some sort of extension of depreciation rates or something else that's going on?","Brian X. Tierney","It's the fact that in 2013 and '14, we've broken out bonus depreciation. We anticipate being a taxpayer again in 2015, and that's reflected in cash flow from operations and not broken out.","Unknown Analyst","But it doesn't imply a deceleration in earnings?","Brian X. Tierney","That's correct.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then finally, you talked about -- I think you talked about in your comments on the slide on sales growth a significant difference in expected earnings growth from industrial in West versus East. And I see that you've got a massive amount of demand for new power gen for transmission, in particular.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Can you talk a little bit more about that? We see industry trends -- this is one of Paul's questions he usually asks. Sales has been -- the outlook is pretty bleak. My sense is that over time, that that's going to be very -- the regional winners and losers are going to be pretty differentiated. And with the Utica, we hope you're a winner. So can you talk about how you see sort of short, medium and long-term sales growth trends?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, I can talk about some of that, and Nick, I'll let you fill in the blanks. So we are seeing it very much on a regional basis. As we laid out in the industrial-specific side, we are seeing a real increase in industrial load associated, in particular, with the shale gas plays, Wheeling, West Virginia, for us and in Eastern Ohio. So we are seeing expansions associated with gas compression processing in those areas. It's significant and real. We are also seeing some pretty significant increases in load in Oklahoma and Texas, also associated with gas and oil production and shale gas developments down there. A lot of that's associated with -- a lot of what that means to us is increased transmission and increased distribution spend to get new customers either expanded or hooked up as well. So those particular areas, we're seeing real spots of growth. In other components of our Eastern system, we're seeing load growth largely flat or moderately down. Indiana, the western and central parts of Ohio are somewhat challenged, as are other parts of Kentucky. So for us, this is a particular area where the diversity of our footprint really helps us diversify away from some of the decreases that we have and being able to take advantage of some of the real load increases that we're seeing associated with the shale gas developments.","Nicholas K. Akins","So Greg, my take on it is if there's an energy renaissance that includes shale gas activity, AEP's service territory sits extremely well from a fundamental perspective. I mean, as you said, you bring up the Utica Shale, you bring up the Eagle Ford Shale, we're having a substantial growth in that portion of the territory. Now you have the Cline Shale in Texas as well, in our North Texas area. And then we already have the Haynesville, Bossier, the Fayetteville, the Bakken. That's in our territories. So if there's oil and gas activity going on -- which has been our saving grace, actually, from an industrial standpoint, at this point and from a load perspective. If you continue to see that improve with an economy that's coming back, then you'll see not only those kinds of facilities pick up, piping manufacturers and so forth, but also petrochemicals along the river. Those are the kinds of things that we're looking forward to. And you're seeing some early indications of industrial output improving. But certainly, it has a ways to go, and certainly, it needs a -- I mean, it needs a federal focus that provides for the economy to fully recover. When that happens, we're going to take off.","Unknown Analyst","Just a point of clarification on the environmental CapEx. You had mentioned there's about $4 billion to $5 billion to be spent between now and 2020. And in the back, in the appendix, there are some potential environmental investments to be made, about 11,000 megawatts. I'm wondering what's the timing of that -- of those 11,000 megawatts. Is it incorporated in that CapEx forecast? And also, I'd like to get your thoughts on greenhouse gases with regards to existing sources.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes, so I'll give my thoughts on greenhouse gases, and then I'll ask Mark McCullough to pick it up, so you can hear from him a little bit on the other part of your question. I think that certainly, the greenhouse gas issue has picked up, as everyone knows. The president, in his State of the Union address, there were 3 things that we were actually looking for: cyber security, which he mentioned; and then certainly, climate change and its impacts from a greenhouse gas perspective; and the other was infrastructure development, which I saw as positive, particularly in terms of our River Ops and the things we're trying to do across our system from an electric utility perspective. But from a greenhouse gas perspective, we have -- and Gina McCarthy, who has been in discussions with a lot of people -- I mean, that's very public. She's been saying she'd talk to anybody that would talk to her. But those discussions have gone -- or seem to be going well. I think we have to be really rational about what we do relative to greenhouse gas, particularly on existing units. Now we still have to complete the new unit greenhouse gas rules. That's going to take time. And then there's no actual timing requirement to deal with the greenhouse gas issues on existing units. They're already past their settlement date. But nevertheless, when we look at the system, HAPs MACT was, I think, a surprise for the EPA. There were a multitude of issues involved. Originally, they came out and said 10,000 gigawatts would be affected. We said and we were the first out saying there would be 60,000 gigawatts affected, 6,000 on our system, and that there would be reliability implications associated with it. And indeed, both of those counts have been fortified with all the debate with the RTOs and so forth. So I'm not saying I told you so, but we tend to know something about the system that we operate. And there are other issues involved from a reliability standpoint but also from a state perspective. So if there's too dramatic a change, too quickly, on existing unit requirements, particularly on existing coal where there's no technology that's commercially available at a pricing point that could even survive, that would be a clear problem for the reliability of the grid and for customer prices going forward. Many people don't realize that changes in electric utility prices are highly regressive. The poor and middle class are impacted more by increases than anyone else because it takes a larger portion of their disposable income. And you've got to think about those impacts as well. But I tend to look at -- on the system side, sort of as an iceberg, and basically, HAPs MACT truncated the top part of the iceberg above the water level. If you get into greenhouse gas requirements too quickly on existing units, you're going to take a broad swath of the entire coal fleet in this country out, and that's not where we need to be. And certainly, from a recovery perspective, we're going to see plants retire, jobs go away in '15 -- 2014 and '15 and '16, based upon HAPs MACT, at this point. You would just further exacerbate that situation if we move too quickly with the climate -- with the greenhouse gas on existing units. So I'm hopeful that people have learned a little bit in this process about the impacts it has on the grid. There is an entire process at play now, a multiyear process at the states themselves and the commissions. The state commissioners are having to deal with price increases, having to deal with decisions about even whether you put scrubbers on or replace generation or retire generation, and that process is ongoing. If you want to disrupt that entire process and start back at ground zero from the state perspective and have an impact on prices for customers, dramatic increase in prices for customers at a time when we're trying to restart a tenuous economy, it makes absolutely no sense. So I'm hopeful that if there is greenhouse gas requirements, that there will be such a timetable that it'll support the transformation that's already occurring. We're already on target because of the advent of shale gas activities to achieve the Waxman-Markey requirements of 17% decrease by 2020. That's already occurring. So this industry is already moving that direction. And I think it's just important for people to realize we are an industry in transition. We need to take time to do it. We don't need to disrupt the process, and we certainly don't need to strand a bunch of investment that we're already making for HAPs MACT, billions of dollars of investment that would be stranded as a result of moving too quickly on this. So those are the kinds of discussions that we're having. And hopefully, this time, we'll get more response. So we'll see. Now you have -- Mark, do you want to answer the rest of his question on timing.","Mark C. McCullough","Sure. I think it's best to refer you to Slide 22, and where Brian pointed out the environmental spend is moving up to over $500 million this year. We spent a little over $200 million last year. Most of those projects you see in the slide, in the appendix, engineering -- certainly, the pre-FEED studies are complete and much of the engineering and pre-site work is completed. We're poised to move forward as regulatory processes approve moving forward in a particular direction. So much of that $530 million you see for 2013 will be commitments to equipment. We'll begin to order that equipment and prepare the sites for the arrival of that equipment.","Unknown Analyst","Mark, is there anything -- Brian up here, Mark. Is there anything you can say or you'd like to focus us on, on Page 50, in the appendix there, on the left-hand side, the 11,000 megawatts of potential investments?","Mark C. McCullough","Yes, look, those are the numbers. We do have a lot in play with respect to evaluation of these technologies. As Brian mentioned earlier, we're looking for the most efficient, economically-driven technology, and we are prepared to move forward with this plan, as it shows here in the slide. DSI is a prominent player in this strategy. We've learned a lot more about that over the past several months and see it being deployed to comply in a large percentage of our fleet. Andy?","Unknown Analyst","Can we just talk about the dividend policy? Obviously, you've articulated pretty well, but we didn't get a dividend increase last year as we waited for Ohio. How quickly can we kind of see the ramp-up to -- this is called midpoint of 65%. And do we get a little bit of a catch-up in 2013 and then kind of grow from there?","Nicholas K. Akins","I certainly think initially, you're going to be at the lower range of that, given -- going through corporate separation, those types of activities, and then you would see it trend up toward the midpoint. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney","And we can't speak for what the board will or won't do, but they were very mindful in terms of raising that targeted dividend payout ratio, reflecting where we were at the time. So I think the board knew what they were doing by raising it. And if they decide to make any changes, I'd expect that you'd see some of that this year.","Unknown Analyst","Chuck did a great job in his presentation, but kind of the reality, competitive generation is a tough business and you look at the NRG Genon deal and a lot of that was a decision based on getting synergies out of an organization. Given the size of your Ohio fleet, how do you guys think about the long-term importance of that business to AEP? And is this something you scale up, or is it something you exit over time?","Charles E. Zebula","At least our initial thoughts about that business, we're going to build that business as if we're keeping it. Now the focus of it is not to grow it to become a larger, unregulated business. Our focus is to hedge that generation. That is our focus. And if we can make it look regulated, where it's a hedging profile and a portfolio of hedges that support that generation, that is something that's acceptable from a volatility with our shareholders, we'll look at it. But we are a regulated utility, and anything that we can do to fortify that position, we will do.","Unknown Analyst","And I guess we're going to talk corporate strategy, we heard conversations, everything turning into an MLP at this point in time. The transmission business does seem to have some viability as a REIT, according to the IRS. How do you guys think about the transco fitting in the corporate structure, and is that something you guys look to explore to maybe optimize incremental value out of that opportunity?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. At this point, it's really focused on development of the transcos, development of the critical mass to get the transmission company moving. And then, of course, in the future, we can evaluate what it holds for transmission. My focus, though, is to make sure that we move more toward a regulated infrastructure-related business. And transmission is a big part of that. And then ultimately, we'll decide how do we continue to reinforce that for AEP shareholders, and we'll do that.","Unknown Analyst","What are the steps to the corporate separation by January 1, 2014? Sort of what are the signposts for us watch along the way? And then secondly, the impairment that you took in the fourth quarter on Ohio generation, what was that?","Brian X. Tierney","It was associated with assets that are going to be part of the competitive business that we were depreciating on a retirement date to mid-2015. And we used to evaluate those assets as part of the pool. When we got the Ohio corporate separation order, it made sense for us to start evaluating them not as part of the pool, because we don't anticipate them being part of the pool through the end of -- beyond, I guess, 2014. So we started looking at those plants individually. They include Muskingum River 1 to 4, Kanawha [ph] 1 to 3, Picway 5, Beckjord, Sporn 2 and 4.","Unknown Analyst","So those are all plants you're closing?","Brian X. Tierney","Plants that had been anticipated to retire by the end of -- by mid-2015. And when we started looking at them on an individualized basis, we realized we had to take an impairment on them.","Nicholas K. Akins","That was only impairment because of Ohio.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","I wondered if you could also discuss your outlook for retail margin.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes, I made the mistake of doing that on an earnings call, and now they tell me that I shouldn't do that anymore.","Nicholas K. Akins","We can say this, though. Our focus is on margins and customers, customer mixes that provide for higher margins. We are not out there trying to get all the megawatt hours we can get. We're not out there most certainly selling below market. And our focus continues to be those higher margins.","Unknown Analyst","Rich, could you give us some of those signposts that Leslie was asking?","Richard E. Munczinski","Sure. So let's take it by federal government, first.  The FERC, we have filed our cases at the FERC late last year, and we would expect that we will get approval of the 6 filings at the FERC sometime midyear. I'm hoping a little bit earlier than midyear. FERC, hopefully, will not wait for the states. And then as concerned to the states, what we've done is we have filed for the transfer of those units and for the merger of Wheeling into APCo. We filed cases in West Virginia, in Virginia and in Kentucky. Each of the states have now provided us with a procedural schedule. And so there'll be procedures ongoing from now through the summertime. Each of the states and the FERC, we've asked for approval of all this effective January 1, 2014, which is also the same date the pool, the East pool that we continually talk about, will be terminated.","Unknown Analyst","What do you see is the biggest issues that have been raised? I know the asset transfer and, perhaps, the price at which the assets are transferred in. But other than that, does there seem to be material pushback from interveners?","Richard E. Munczinski","There's about 25 interveners at the FERC. I'll put them in 3 buckets. One is there's a few of the parties that are trying to retry the Ohio cases, which FERC shouldn't pay much attention to. Secondly, there's a lot of questions about the language in the agreement. I know we have made this as simple as possible by eliminating the pool, the pooling agreement, and basically having each of the companies stand alone. So there's some language issues that we'll clean up and, hopefully, settle with the parties. And then the transfers themselves, really, will be up to the states. And so each of the states have a case in front of them for the transfers. And then once the transfers are approved, we'll then go in individually to the states and collect the funds for those transfers if they're not offset by the pool dollars already. Does that help?","Unknown Analyst","Brian, I think this one may be for you. On your waterfall chart for '13 guidance, you have the $0.24 of nonutility and parent. If I look back to EEI and sum the kind of 3 buckets that you listed earlier of interest costs, River Operations and then to the retail within Generation and Marketing, it seems that, that has kind of increased by maybe by a $0.10 or so since EEI. Which of the buckets is driving it? Or can you give us any insight into how the $0.24 breaks down?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. The early redemption of debt was probably about $0.12. The River Ops increase was about, I'd say, $0.09 or $0.10, and the balance is the Generation and Marketing.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And Chuck gave us this disclosure on how much of the potential margin is determined in the competitive business and that you have this number of 60% for 2015. Is that a sort of -- is that the annual number adjusting for some of the midyear shift in the buckets? And is there any chance of a number on 2016?","Charles E. Zebula","Yes and no.","Nicholas K. Akins","Go ahead, Chuck.","Charles E. Zebula","The answer is yes and no. So the first question is yes. Second question, no.","Nicholas K. Akins","Any other questions? Okay, well, thank you very much, and thanks for your time."],"1446":["American Electric Power Company Inc.

[Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and replay information will be given out at the conclusion of the conference. I will now turn the call over to your host, Bette Jo Rosa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2019 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today.","Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for our opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","However, before I turn the call over to Nick, I would like to share with you that this will be my last earnings call here at AEP. After 39 years with the company, including 22 years in IR, I have decided to retire effective September 30.","While I thoroughly enjoy my role here at AEP and interacting with all of you, there are other adventures I would like to explore and decided now is the right time. Nick and Brian have graciously invited me to come to EEI Fall Conference so that I can say goodbye to you, and I look forward to seeing you there.","In the meantime, I'm leaving you all in very good hands with Darcy Reese, who most of you already know; and our new addition to IR, Tom Scott, who many of you will get to meet in the coming months.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Thanks, Bette Jo. Before I get started with the earnings call, I would like to recognize Bette Jo for the wonderful job she's done representing this company and our investors. I am a CEO that's been trained by Bette Jo Rosa. I have the permanent bruises on my shins to prove it. I've looked to her for guidance, no pun intended, with the message of our company, and we will sorely miss her.","She mentioned to me that she actually did our first earnings call and has done all of them since. 114 years of earnings call is a lot, just kidding. She's been with the company 39 years, and we have done earnings calls beginning in 2009. So again, Bette Jo, thank you.","Now off to the second quarter. We are doing this a little differently this time. I'm deferring the actual discussion of the GAAP and operating financial performance to Brian's part of the presentation other than to say it was another steady-as-she-goes quarter with financial operating performance consistent with our expectations.","So no surprise there. We continue to confirm our operating guidance for the year of $4 to $4.20 per share for the year and our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate.","And of course, our Board earlier this year approved the second quarter dividend consistent with our financial plan, which Brian will also cover in more detail. While the financials for the quarter met our expectations, there were some important catalysts for future growth that developed during the quarter.","I'll continue by covering those as well as other highlights and topics for the quarter that we believe you might all be interested in. First, we made several wind resource filings in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma and our SWEPCO and PSO operating companies consistent with our integrated resource plan expectations.","SWEPCO and PSO are seeking regulatory approvals to acquire three wind generation facilities currently under development in North Central Oklahoma that total 1,485 megawatts. Hence, the name North Central Wind Initiatives. These projects are being developed by Invenergy and will be acquired on a fixed price turn-key basis at COD.","If approved, 200 megawatts will be acquired by the end of 2020 with the balance being acquired at the end of 2021. This $2 billion regulated investment opportunity represents a unique win-win for customers and shareholders. The investment is expected to both lower customer rates and provide a long-term earnings opportunity for shareholders.","Customer benefits total approximately $3 billion nominal cost net of costs over the 30-year life of the facilities. The investments produce near-term customer savings and positive customer benefits under a wide array of power natural gas and production sensitivities. We are seeking timely regulatory approvals in each estate in order to take advantage of the expiring federal PTC.","The net value of the PTC is accrued to our customers total approximately at $1.4 billion and offset nearly 70% of the total capital investment over the first 10 years of the projects. The acquisition can be scaled subject to commercial limitations to align with individual state resource needs and approvals. We have the ability to take a minimum of 810 megawatts and then provide states the ability to take more megawatts should another state or states reject our applications.","And we have designed enough flexibility into our applications to move forward under scenarios where only one, two, three, or four states approve. These highly efficient 44% capacity factor wind investments will serve to further diversify our generation fuel mix and act as a valuable fuel price hedge for our customers over the long-term.","So, you might wonder why we didn't acquire for the full 2,200 megawatts that our SWEPCO and PSO integrated resource plans propose. Because these projects were competitively bid, we recognized the clear breakpoint between the winning three projects that happen to be Invenergy Projects who we had worked with in the past and others from a pricing perspective.","We wanted to position the best projects first and clear winners from an end-of-money viewpoint so that our commissions could clearly recognize the value for our customers. We can always come in later to fill in the rest of the resource planning requirements with future bids. And we feel good about that from a risk perspective.","By following the normal regulatory processes that exist with projects that clearly benefit our customers and with less risky multiple projects that are already being developed and utilization of existing SPP transmission capacity, we believe that these projects were set up for success.","With our regulators, our customers, and our shareholders we learned a lot from the experience of Wind Catcher. And these filings prove that.","Now onto the next hot issue, the Ohio House Bill 6 legislation. Governor DeWine earlier this week filed legislation that will provide support for the nuclear units in Ohio as well as support for the OVAC generating units. While the legislation phases out the RPS mandate after 2026, it still provides benefits for the recovery of existing renewable contracts until 2032 and provides additional support for solar projects that have already received siting approval including our 400 megawatts of proposed solar project, which can also collect from the same clean energy fund as the nuclear units.","So, to reiterate, as far as AEP is concerned, we see positives from this legislation for us, namely recovery of OVAC that is collected on a statewide basis through 2030; secondly, recovery of our existing renewable contracts entered into to comply with previous legislation and approved by the PECO; the opportunity for AEP Ohio to enter into bilateral contracts with certain customers.","This one is an important issue for AEP, as we have had specific requests from various customers for AEP Ohio to be the provider of renewable resources in addition to being the largest provider.","And fourth, the ability for solar projects that have siting board approval to access the $20 million of the clean air funds, which includes the 400 megawatts of solar that we now have before the PECO. The access to these funds make these particular projects even more beneficial for customers.","And as you recall, the request for these projects include a $6 million per year debt equivalency rider to maintain AEP Ohio's capital structure. And finally, the net impact of HB6 will provide headroom to our rate payers, which will enable potential additional distribution investments to improve the customer experience and grid reliability.","AEP does believe in the importance of nuclear generation as a part of the portfolio of this country and the state of Ohio. We congratulate speaker householders, senate President Obhof, Governor DeWine, Lieutenant Governor Husted, and Chairman Randazzo along with many other members of the Ohio legislature and balancing the interest of the need for a balance portfolio, employment and economic development issues, and customer benefit.","I also do not think we should view this as the end of energy policy activities in Ohio. From our perspective, HB247 that includes provisions for grid modernization and behind-the-meter technologies is important.","This legislation would clarify the ability for AEP Ohio to continue to deliver emerging technologies to our customers that not only improve your customer experience but enhances grid resiliency and efficiency. This is a critical area to provide clarity regarding these types of investments that will define the future of the electric utility. HB247 will continue review in the house with hearings expected in September.","And AEP believes this to be the companion bill that will complete a redefinition of Ohio energy policy. Another legislative session that just concluded was in Texas that provided some important wins for SWEPCO and AEP Texas.","SWEPCO can now recover reasonable costs for deployment of advanced metering technologies while providing customer protections. AMI technology has been implemented in the ERCOT portion of Texas but not in the SWEPCO Texas jurisdiction. So, we are pleased that that can proceed.","Also, new legislation allows SWEPCO to obtain approval for a rider from the PECT to recover the investment and power generation facilities outside of a rate case when the generation goes into operation with certain provisions being made for subsequent rate case timing and the size of the investment.","Also affecting both SWEPCO and AEP Texas, the legislature passed Senate Bill 1938, a roper bill that clarifies rules regarding the investment in any new interconnected transmission facilities. Yesterday, we announced the purchase of 227 megawatts, 75% interest in the Santa Rita Wind Farm for approximately $356 million. This is just another example of our continued growth consistent with a capital plan for our contracted renewables business.","We also could not be more pleased with the outcome of the purchase of the Sempra Wind assets. We are already seeing the prospects of this business continue to grow beyond the value of the original deal financial expectations.","Not only are earnings so far from the business toward the upper end of our acquisition modeling, but the development projects are moving along nicely as well. AEP Clean Energy Resources is close to completing negotiations related to the construction of one of these development projects that uses the safe harbor equipment.","This project, along with others amounting to 1,000 megawatts are in various stages of development. This business now has committed $1.5 billion of the $2.2 billion committed at EEI last November, so very good progress there.","Brian will be discussing the economy in load in a few minutes in more detail, but I will say while we have seen areas of load decline, primarily tariff-related, we do expect better performance from our load growth in the second half of the year as a result of a number of new customers for expansions that will come on board primarily in the oil and gas area and data center load areas.","The biggest economic headwind we have at this point is the impact of the trade war on the businesses in AEP's service territory. The increasing number of tariffs on goods beyond steel and aluminum have impacted export manufacturers in our service territory.","Certainly, the trade wars have weakened the world economy and caused a strengthening U.S. dollar, which adds even more of a hurdle. Hopefully, all of this can get resolved during the election season, since a strong economy is one of President Trump's major reelection tenets.","So, we will continue to monitor this closely as we move forward in finalizing our expectations for next year regarding load growth. Because the rate cases I&M, SWEPCO Arkansas and AEP Texas are in their initial stages, I'll cover them as we go through the equalizer chart. So, we'll go through that.","Turning to that chart on page 5, AEP's overall regulated operations, ROE, is currently 9.7% versus 10.1% last quarter. The primary reason for the decrease in quarter two 2019 versus quarter one 2019 was the significantly unfavorable weather versus the year before and lower normalized load, mainly in our vertically integrated utilities.","Looking at the individual companies, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter was 12.2%. We expect to end 2019 in this 12.5% to 13% range as we continue to invest in the distribution's smart grid, partially offset by the legacy fuel carrying charges rolling off.","The ROE for Appalachian Power at the end of the second quarter was 8.9% compared to 9.5% at the end of first-quarter 2019. APCO's change in ROE from the previous quarter is primarily attributable to stronger weather results in second-quarter 2018 versus this year. Lower normalized margins also contributed to lower ROE, but this was offset by the payable rate receding in West Virginia.","The ROE for Kentucky power at the end of the second quarter 2019 was 7.6% compared to 8.6% at the end of first-quarter 2019. Kentucky's second-quarter ROE versus the first quarter was down primarily due to unfavorable weather and unfavorable transmission true-up. We are working on optimizing revenue and scrutinizing the OEM and capital to improve ROE by the end of the year.","The ROE for I&M at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%. I&M's positive performance in the second quarter was primarily driven by timing of expenses and multiple one-time adjustments. I&M expects to end the year with an ROE around 10%, which is in-line with the authorized ROEs in Indiana and Michigan.","I&M continues to successfully execute its capital programs in generation transmission and distribution and recently filed future-test, your rate cases in both Indiana and Michigan to seek timely recovery of the ongoing capital cost.","In Indiana, I&M followed for a $94 million net increase with a 10.5% request at ROE. Intervener testimony is due in August. And hearings are anticipated in October with an expected effective date March 2020.","In Michigan, I&M filed for a net increase of $52 million with a 10.5% ROE. Intervener testimony is due in October. And hearings will occur in November with a commission order expected in April of 2020. The ROE for PSO at the end of the second quarter was 8.4%. PSO received an order on its base case settlement in March 2019, which contained an important provision for a full transmission tracker and a partial distribution tracker.","With the continued implementation of new base rates and tracker, we believe that PSO will earn its authorized ROE by the end of the year. The ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the second quarter was 5.9% versus 7.2% at the end of first-quarter 2019. The most recent 12-month ROE decreased primarily due to unfavorable weather, loss of normalized load margins, and the 2018 wholesale formula rate true-up.","However, the PECT approved the company's TCRF settlement in July, which will produce approximately $11 million of additional annual revenue. Additionally, we filed in Arkansas an Arkansas base rate case in February 2019. SWEPCO's ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates. And this impacts the ROE by about 125 basis points. SWEPCO filed in Arkansas for a net increase of $34 million, which is the $46 million minus $12 depreciation with 10.5% ROE.","Arkansas Public Service Commission staff recommended a $20 million increased based upon a 9.5% ROE. The filing provides for SWEPCO's movement to an annual, formula-based rate review mechanism. Hearings are expected in October with new rates expected to go in effect in early 2020. The ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the second quarter was 8.5%. The reason for the increased ROE this quarter is primarily due to a one-time deferral of previously reported interest expense approved for recovery in the AEP Texas storm cost securitization financing order issued in June 2019.","We expect the ROE to decline by year-end due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings and our base rate review filed with the PUCT on May 1, 2019. During a rate review year, there is a lag associated with these filings. Continued high levels of investment will continue to have an impact on the ROE in 2019. Regarding the rate review, we filed a net increase of $35 million with 10.5% ROE.","Intervener testimony is due today, and hearings are set for August with an expected effective date in first quarter 2020. The ROE for AEP transmission holdco at the end of the second quarter 2019 was 10.6%. AEP transmission holdco quarter two ROE is higher than quarter one due to a favorable change in one-time events such as the prior year true-up in June. Regarding the FERC 206 filings in the AEP east and west territories, we have obtained settlement orders in both cases.","In May, the FERC issued a settlement approval order for the east territory of AEP that includes a base ROE of 9.85%, effective January 1, 2018 with a total ROE of 10.35% including the 50 basis point RTO adder. The settlement includes a cap on the equity portion of the cap structure at 55%.","In the west transmission area, the FERC issued an order at the end of June that includes a base ROE of 10%, effective back to the date of the first complaint. This is a total ROE of 10.5% including the 50 basis point RTO adder. There are no caps on the equity portion of the cap structure. And implementation of the new rates will occur in third quarter. Refunds for prior periods will be made part of the annual true-ups. And the parties agreed not to seek any change in the ROE prior to January 2021.","So all-in-all, another great quarter, particularly with the headwinds of tariff-related economic conditions. The second quarter still met expectations financially but more importantly, the predicate has been set for some important growth opportunities. I would be remiss in not mentioning an evolving side of the earnings growth equation bending the OEM curve.","In the face of operational challenges that the industry has recently faced, operational excellence is paramount as the foundation of AEP's ability to advance the creativity and innovation necessary to move our company forward in our transformation to be the premium utility of the future.","Technology innovations through digitization and automation is absolutely required to get us there. There will be more to come in November EEI, but I just want to give you a couple of examples that we have implemented in this phase. One, we call the asset damage assessment tool, ADAT, that digitizes information to more effectively screen facility locates for underground facilities.","We expect to be able to clear a request without sending crews for inspection as we do today, saving time and resources. And two, our breaker shot digital maintenance platform where digitized real-time information will improve efficiency, thereby allowing more preventative maintenance inspections of our over 7,500 generation related breakers to be brought in-house as opposed to more expensive outside contractors being used for the work.","Just a couple of examples, but many others will continue to move the needle on reducing OEM and provide better service to our customers. These efforts remind me of a drummer that creates new rhythms that can only be grounded by the rudiments or fundamentals of drumming. A lot of practice to develop muscle memory and the creativity to develop new complicated rhythms that redefine the notion of operating rhythm.","As an example, just listen to a famous drummer, Gavin Harrison, who played an unusual 7\/4 time signature beat in Sound of Muzak, which M-U-Z-A-K, if you're looking it up by Porcupine Tree. A great sounding song but very difficult to learn and play. This is what AEP is in the process of doing now, focusing on the fundamentals of operational excellence to provide the muscle memory while establishing the culture of creativity and innovation necessary to define a new operating rhythm of technology deployment to bend the OEM curve and find new avenues for growth.","So, while this quarter is another solid quarter, just know that we are feverishly in the background driving forward and providing future shareholder value and improving our customer's experience. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's stop briefly on Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and the year-to-date periods.","GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.93 per share compared to $1.07 per share in 2018. GAAP earnings through June were $2.10 per share compared to $2 per share in 2018. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the appendix. Let's go into the detail on Slide 7 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment.","Operating earnings for the second quarter were $1 per share or $494 million compared to $1.01 per share or $498 million in 2018. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.38 per share, down $0.18. Weather was the largest driver of the variants this quarter down $0.13 from last year, driven by the warmer than normal temperatures experienced in the spring of 2018.","Normalized load was also unfavorable with decreases across all classes. We will talk more in detail about our normalized load and regional economies a little bit later. Rate changes helped offset these declines. You can see other smaller impacts for this segment listed on the slide.","The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.27 per share, up $0.04 from last year. Favorable items included rate changes and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT as well as favorable carrying charges and taxes. These favorable items were partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes on the increased investment and higher O&M due to storms.","The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.31 per share, an improvement of $0.10 over last year. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base as well as the impacts of the annual true-up and a favorable FERC settlement. Net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 19% since June of last year. Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.06 per share, up $0.01 from last year, primarily driven by the growing renewables business and the repowering of Trent Mesa and Desert Sky as well as the acquisition of the Sempra Wind assets.","Corporate and other was up $0.02 primarily due to the consolidating tax items that should levelize over the year and will partially offset by higher interest expense and a positive tax adjustment from last year that did not recur.","Let's turn to Slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $2.19 per share or $1.1 billion, compared to $1.97 per share or $972 million in 2018. Looking at the earning drivers by segment, operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.01 per share, down $0.02 with weather subtracting $0.15 compared to last year.","Normalized load was also down for the year across all classes. And depreciation increased due to incremental investment. On the positive side, rate changes added $0.18 per share. Lower O&M added $0.06. And AFUDC and transmission revenue were each favorable by $0.02. Through June, the transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.58 per share, up $0.09 from last year influenced by the reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio.","Other favorable drivers included higher rate changes and transmission revenue as well as favorable carrying charges and taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investment as well as higher O&M and unfavorable weather.","The AEP transmission holdco segment contributed $0.57 per share, up $0.15 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base as well as the impact of the annual true-up and a FERC settlement.","Generation and marketing produced $0.14 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Increases in retail margins and the growth in the renewables business were offset by lower generation sales due to plant retirements and outages. Finally, corporate and other was down $0.01, primarily driven by higher interest expense in taxes, which were partially offset by lower O&M. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance of $4 to $4.20 per share.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 and update you on our load performance. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales decreased by 1.8% for the quarter compared to 2018. This decline is largely responsible for the 1% decrease in the year-to-date comparison. For both comparisons, normalized retail sales were down across all operating companies and retail classes. We now anticipate 2019 normalized sales to come in two-tenths of a percent below 2018.","Moving clockwise, industrial sales decreased by 2.7% for the quarter, which brought the year-to-date comparison down to 1.5% below last year. Sales to the industrial class have been slowing in recent quarters as the impact of the strong dollar and more restrictive trade policy have challenged export manufacturers within AEP's footprint.","For both the quarter and the year-to-date comparison, industrial sales were down across all operating companies with the exception of Public Service Company of Oklahoma, which benefited from increased oil and gas activity in 2019. I will provide more color on our industrial sales on the next slide.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales decreased by 1.4%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. As described earlier, the weak second quarter performance erased the positive momentum from earlier this year, making the year-to-date comparison essentially flat. The decline in normalized usage for the quarter more than offset the four-tenths of a percent growth in customer accounts.","Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales decreased by nine-tenths of a percent for the quarter and were down 1.3% year-to-date. For both comparisons, commercial sales were down across all operating companies. The tightening labor market and rising interest rates have limited this sector's growth in recent quarters.","Turning to Slide 10, I'll provide more color with respect to our industrial sales growth. This chart shows the disparity in growth between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. The oil and gas sector load shown in blue mirrors the pattern for oil prices. For the quarter, industrial sales in the oil and gas sectors increased by 2.8%. We expect growth in oil and gas to continue throughout 2019 based on a number of new projects identified to come online later this year, primarily in the mid and downstream part of the sector. Focusing on the red bars, the non-oil and gas industrials have struggled since the first tariffs were announced last year.","For the quarter, industrial sales other than oil and gas declined by 4.6% compared to last year. Most of this slowdown can be tracked to the export industries such as chemicals manufacturing, which is down 14% for the quarter. Ironically, sales to the primary metals sector declined by 1% this quarter despite the tariffs on steel and aluminum. As discussed on previous calls, AEP has a higher exposure to trade policy given the higher concentration of export manufacturers located within the service territory.","Despite these headwinds, we have a number of new industrial expansions, as I said earlier, largely focused on oil and gas. And we expect this to drive industrial sales into the positive territory for the full year. Now let's turn to Slide 11 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 1.8% for the quarter, which is eight-tenths of a percent below the U.S. The strongest growth for the quarter came from the AEP Texas service territory. All of our service territories experienced GDP growth with the exception of Kentucky.","Moving to the upper right chart, you see that employment growth for the AEP service territory improved this quarter to 1% above last year, while U.S. growth moderated slightly in the second quarter. Throughout the AEP footprint, over 18,000 jobs were added in the second quarter with 37% of those coming from the education and healthcare sector.","Other sectors that experienced strong growth and employment in the quarter included construction and natural resources and mining. Final chart at the bottom shows the income growth of AEP's footprint moderated slightly in the second quarter while U.S. income growth accelerated. For the quarter, personal incomes within AEP's service territory increased by 3.4%, which was seven-tenths of a percent below the U.S. Income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales.","Now let's move on to Slide 11. I'm sorry. Let's move on to slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt total capital ratio increased 1% during the quarter to 58.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the BAA1 range at 15.3%. And our net liquidity stood at about $2.6 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding decreased approximately 2% to 96%. And our OPEB funding decreased approximately 1% to 130%. A drop in interest rates with the largest driver in the decreased funding status with strong equity and fixed income returns helped offset much of the liability increases.","Let's try to wrap this up on Slide 13, so we can get to your questions. We have successfully achieved outcomes in all expected regulatory cases. And we will work with our regulators to obtain approval in the North Central Wind initiative benefiting our PSO and SWEPCO customers. Our year-to-date performance in the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.20 per share. ","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is Greg Gordon, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning. Greg.","Greg Gordon","Good morning. Bette Jo, like an institution is leaving its very \u2013 I'm happy for you but at the same time sad that we're going to miss you. Looking forward to seeing you. That's my question. That's it. Just kidding. No, my question is with regard\u2026","Nick Akins","Ask her if she's going to stay longer.","Greg Gordon","My question is with regard just a little bit more thought perhaps on what's going on, on the demand side. I mean, clearly, on the industrial side, you've been upfront on saying that things are a little bit behind plan. And you point to the trade tensions and other factors. At the same time, it looks like the demand from the oil and gas sectors remain strong except, we're seeing signs of significant weakening and activity there in real-time. So how do you guys manage around the potential volatility in those areas in the economy if they wind up trending weaker than planned over the next several years?","Brian Tierney","Greg, we've always, of course, monitored load and what's going on with that. And we've tried to adjust over time our O&M spend in response to how load is impacted either by trade tariffs, the dollar or things like weather. And we saw that impact this quarter as well. You mentioned seeing slowdown in oil and gas. We're kind of seeing the opposite of that. We're seeing uptick in oil and gas right now including expansions through the end of the year. And whereas previously, we've seen things really on the upstream side, we're now starting to see things on the mid and downstream side as the infrastructure comes in to fulfill what's been happening in the producing part of that industry.","So, we're still seeing uptick in oil and gas and anticipate increases in that throughout the balance of the year. But we are subject as everyone else to what's happening with the general economy and weather. We've been very successful in responding to that over the last several years and anticipate doing the same going forward.","Nick Akins","The interesting thing is, Greg, the oil prices remain at least relatively decent and like, I guess, natural gas prices continue to be relatively low. But there's a lot of oil field activity. But also, as Brian said, the infrastructure pipeline activity continues because there's a lot of production that can't \u2013 and that's why prices are so low in live territories. They just can't get the transmission capabilities.","So, a lot of work continues in that regard. The other part is even our industrial base is pretty diversified. And it's unusual to see several of them line up. Eight out of 10, I believe the sectors are decreasing. And you can really point to the tariff activity. So, if that gets resolved, we should be in much better shape in our territory. That being said, there is expansion going on. Matter of fact, there was just an announcement in Corpus Christi of a large expansion there. It was announced a couple days ago.","So, we continue to see the pipeline of activity. And I think we just need to get past these tariff issues so that people really understand and companies understand the rules of the game so they can make investments. So, we'll get there. But until then, we'll do what we've always done. No matter what's going on with all the fundamentals associated with our business, we pull the levers we need to make sure externally, we revive that consistent quality of earnings going forward. So, if the economy's adjusting, we have to adjust.","Greg Gordon","Clear. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Julien.","Alex Morgan","Good morning. This is Alex calling in for Julien. Congratulations, by the way, Bette Jo.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you.","Alex Morgan","I have two quick questions. And one is first on Ohio. I was wondering if you have looked into and could detail the impact of decoupling from the Ohio Bill 6. I know that this is something that First Energy is exploring. And I was wondering if this could potentially be a positive for you as well.","Nick Akins","Well, we're already decoupled in Ohio. So, that really isn't an issue for us.","Alex Morgan","Okay, great. And then my second question is plans for AMI in SWEPCO, if this could also be another positive for the company and if so, when we might anticipate future announcements about it.","Nick Akins","Yes. I think it will be positive for SWEPCO. And certainly, we want to go about the process as quickly as possible to get AMI metering put in place as a predicate for many of the technologies that we're working with. So, it's important to do that. I think you're probably going to be seeing a focus on that very soon now that the whole installation is done.","Alex Morgan","Okay. Thank you. And also including Arkansas and states like that rather than just Texas?","Nick Akins","Well, certainly, we'll install AMI metering wherever we can install it. And I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we could do that in the other states already. We just haven't gotten to the point of moving that process ahead in those jurisdictions yet, but we're getting there.","Alex Morgan","Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking my questions.","Nick Akins","We had recently installed some AMR meters in SWEPCO. And so, we're really managing through dealing with the replacement of those at the same time of putting in AMI metering. So, it's one of those areas where timing is going to be really important. And certainly, the regulatory process will be key in terms of the implementation.","Alex Morgan","Okay. Thank you again.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Next question is Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hey. Good morning. Bette Jo, congratulations. Definitely wish you the best.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you.","Steve Fleishman","So just \u2013 this maybe \u2013 I don't know if you have this detail, but out of curiosity, when you talk about the strength in oil and gas, is there a big difference between the AEP east and AEP west businesses? Is it mainly in the west?","Brian Tierney","Yes. Steve, yes. So we're seeing it in the west, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. How about the AEP east oil and gas? Is that down or flat or still up?","Brian Tierney","It's still up. But it's not to the degree that the west part is.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then maybe could you just talk about maybe a little more color on the regulatory approval process on North West \u2013 North Wind and just kind of timelines and the like?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, I guess, the beauty of all this is it's using the standard integrated resource plan processes. And we'll go through the normal hearings, but we're expecting to have an outcome in about a year. The filings have just been made. And obviously, we'll go through the testimony and all that kind of stuff in the meantime. We'll try to move it as expeditiously as we can to take advantage of the PTCs. But we expect the procedural schedules to come out soon, but our expectation is it'll take about a year to get those approvals.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And do you just need to prove that \u2013 you don't need to prove need, you just need to prove this is least cost or in the public interest?","Nick Akins","Well, yes. That's right. There is capacity needs and TSO. And then SWEPCO is looking at it from really a customer benefit perspective.","Steve Fleishman","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Yes. Really nothing unusual about these filings. And that's probably the good thing. We went after Wind Catcher because it was a unique opportunity. And we certainly wanted to be able to perform that project. But it was outside the regulatory process and all that stuff. And the risk involved of large transmission. So, this is a very different proposition within the framework of the existing processes. So, we feel good about it.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski, Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. Bette Jo, congratulations. So, two questions. You mentioned that the Sempra Wind portfolio, both the operating assets and the development pipeline are actually exceeding your expectations. That together with some of the cost-cutting, is that enough to keep you in the middle of your guidance range for this year?","Nick Akins","Yes, we feel good about where we stand for the guidance of this year and with the additions there along with our optimization activities. But also, we have gone through several series of rate cases in previous years that continue to benefit us as well. So, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of issues to look at, a lot of areas where \u2013 every year we have positives and negatives. But all in all, it comes down to where we fully support the guidance that we give. And I don't see an issue there at all.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And the secondly, so you have those additional growth drivers like the AMI, CapEx, potentially rate case renewables and stuff on PSO. How should we think about those? Are those going to elongate the current growth rate for the company? I.e., there's going to be some production of, say, transmission spending or some other CapEx to basically keep the growth rate changed? Or is this incremental to the current growth rate?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, we continue to look at what the future holds and still an obviously long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We'd be disappointed if it wasn't in the upper end of that because we expect to get approvals for these additional wind projects that we haven't included in our plan. We're watching the economy obviously. And you tell me what the timing is of getting the tariff issues resolved. But they'll probably get resolve before the election I would presume. If that's the case, then we should be in really good shape.","And of course, every year that goes by \u2013 we're a large company. And fueling 5% to 7% growth is more and more of a challenge. But that's why we look at things like what is going on with our contractor renewables, the value of the Sempra deal, what's going on with the regulated additions, not just regulated additions in the Western territories but in the Eastern territories as well, particularly with the legislation.","And keep in mind too I think it's really important to focus on what Ohio has just done. It's opened up the ability for us to work directly with customers on the AEP Ohio side where they wanted to because there's customers who have said, we want you to do our solar projects. We want you to do the resources for these facilities. And to this point, we've been unable to say that AEP Ohio could do that. Now we can.","And so, I think that's going to fuel a further expansion from a renewables standpoint and from a resource standpoint, microgrids, and so forth. And watch this House Bill 247 because I think that's really important around what we do on the digitization, automation, the technologies at the distribution side. And I continue to view the distribution wedge, capital wedge of this company continuing to grow considerably as a result of that.","The other thing too is transmission. We have to spend $2.5 billion just to keep the present average age. So, if you think about that, that's a foundation.","And if we ever want to advance the age, which is pretty old at this point, we have to continue to invest in a large degree in transmission to make sure that our system remains reliable and resilient.","So, there's so many opportunities. Well, another one I would point out is a pilot that we're doing in Virginia right now around broadband. We're doing sort of the midstream broadband that the others, AT&T and others are supportive of us doing because we're already putting in fiber for resiliency of the grid itself in terms of analytics.","There's available capacity. We can bring the rural areas closer to the urban centers as well, allow broadband to exist in these communities that don't have it today. And that's another opportunity for us to continue to go. And then classification of the economy. So, I'm bullish about the growth opportunities of this business.","The question on our minds is how we manage our balance sheet around FFO to debt and those kinds of metrics and be able to address all the capital opportunities we have. And of course, that may mean recycling assets, doing what we need to do to optimize the efficiency of the use of that balance sheet. So, there's still a lot of work for us to do. There really is good work.","Angie Storozynski","Just one follow-up to the balance sheet management. You never mentioned how you're going to finance those rate-based renewables at SWEPCO and PSO. Is it fair to say that this update is coming only once the approvals are in, i.e., about 12 months from now?","Brian Tierney","Absolutely, Angie. So, obviously, when we talked about this opportunity, it's not what we've laid out in our current financing plans. This would be incremental to it. And we would update that as we get approvals. But I think you've seen from us in the past really putting generally equal measures of debt and equity together to finance our capital plans and really fairly conservative management of our balance sheet. And I think you'll see that continuing going forward.","Angie Storozynski","Great. Thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Ali Agha, SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning. Bette Jo, best wishes to you as well.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you.","Ali Agha","First question, Nick or Brian, just wanted to clarify the growth outlook. I recall I think in the past when you've talked about your base plan. And that was before you announced the wind projects and renewable projects that you thought that your base plan could track you to the high end of the 5% to 7% growth rate. Is that still your expectation? And if you get these wind approvals, could that theoretically actually take you above the 5% to 7% growth rate?","Nick Akins","Well, I've always said and I continue to say we believe it certainly will make 5% to 7% more robust. And we'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end. And we're going have to get through and determine what happens to the load going forward. We have the growth opportunities there.","But if you have tempering aspects of load growth, I think it'd be probably good for us right now to stand padded at the 5% to 7% what we said previously that we expect to be and certainly would be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of that 5% to 7%.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then more near-term again, just to clarify. You've brought down your load expectations for this year from up 1% to now slightly down. Weather obviously has been a drag. Can you just remind us in the very short-term what are sort of the immediate offsets to think about that could help you this year? Is it all O&M? Or is that something that's actually gone better than perhaps budgeted to offset that?","Brian Tierney","Yes, Ali. It's a couple things. One is O&M, the other one is we've had some positive rate outcomes that have outpaced our expectations for the year.","Ali Agha","I see. Okay. And then lastly, just to also clarify, assuming that the entire $2 billion management is approved, would you consider that all incremental? Or is there an opportunity for you to standout some of the base CapEx and fit it in within the current CapEx profile?","Brian Tierney","We've not made a determination on that yet, Ali.","Ali Agha","Gotcha. Thank you.","Nick Akins","Thanks.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Morning, guys. I got a longer-term question for you. When you look around across the jurisdictions, where do you lack regulatory mechanisms that you would like to see to get put in place? Which of the jurisdictions where you think your regulatory team has the most wood to chop? And how do you think that process plays out in those few jurisdictions? What's on your wish list?","Nick Akins","Yes. I have a lot of wishes. But we have about 65, two-thirds to 70% of our rate recovery is through tracker-rider mechanisms. So, we're doing pretty well from that perspective. But there are things obviously I'd like to see because the utility business right now, we're needing to invest in the resiliency and the reliability of this grid and really refurbish the grid in a major way.","And that tells me that it'd be great to have more forward-looking type of test years like we do in Indiana. The formula-based rate mechanisms are really good. But there's still some wet lagging. But they're better than waiting on rate cases and stuff. And I think it's important to have mechanisms in place where there are formula-based rates, where there are forward-test years. Those kinds of things need to be in place to allow us to continue to invest and not impact our balance sheet from an FFO to debt perspective.","And keep in mind, AEP did not go out for additional equity or anything with tax reforms. So, certainly, it brought our credit metrics in to something that obviously, we need to watch, particularly as you're investing capital. And then with load decreasing and revenue having an impact associated with that, that's going to further impact the FFO to debt.","So, we're watching that very closely, those metrics to preserve our balance sheet. And then that's obviously something we're going have to continue to work through. So, I don't know if you have anything to add, Brian.","Brian Tierney","Michael, we don't have any jurisdictions where we have real concerns any longer. There's been a lot of progress that's been made in places like Oklahoma where we still have integrated utilities, and it's not just wires only. One of the initiatives that we're working on and taking a close look at from the terms of the risk of the customer and ourselves are the depreciation rates associated with our fossil generating stations and making sure that they're in line.","So, that's an initiative that all of our vertically integrated utilities are looking at. We made some headway in that in regards to the Rockport generation depreciation in Indiana where we had an offset associated with the flowback of the deferred income taxes.","We were able to shorten up the depreciation period and not impact customer rates by having that offset from the deferred income tax flowback. So, that's an initiative that we're working across the jurisdictions. But kind of a blessing, we don't have any that we would call trouble jurisdictions today.","The jurisdictions are operating well. And our operating companies have strong relationships with the regulators and legislatures. And we're getting good outcomes like Nick described in Ohio. So, there's no sore point that we are overly concerned about but just some broad-based initiatives that we continue to work.","Nick Akins","Yes. A lot of balls on our equalizer chart, it's either because of weather or that we continue to invest heavily in these jurisdictions. But it's clearly important for us. And you're seeing advancement of formula-based rate mechanisms. Arkansas, for example. We now have some significant riders in TSO in Oklahoma.","And of course, the other riders in Indiana, Michigan, and so forth. And those are beneficial. But if I look at two things forward-looking for this industry, with the issues of cyber, physical security, refurbishment of the grid, ensuring that we maintain a reliable system going forward, it's imperative that we're able to invest and recover on a timely basis. And that tells me, formula-based rates, I'll take it. Forward-test years, even better. And we need to work that around the horn across all the jurisdictions.","Michael Lapides","Got it, guys. Thank you. Very thorough answer. Much appreciated.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Operator, we have time for one more call.","Operator","Okay. And that question is from the line of Praful Mehta, Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. Morning. And congratulations, Bette Jo. All the best.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you.","Praful Mehta","So, maybe the first question on Slide 9, where you have the industrial growth and I know you've touched on this in the past. But just wanted to confirm, year-to-date down 1.5%. But your budget clearly is positive. So, you clearly see already things that are in place that would increase in load between now and year-end. Is that right, just to confirm?","Brian Tierney","That's correct, Praful. And when we see expansions that are out a year or more than a year, we need to really weight those for probability of them coming in. We feel pretty confident about things as close in as six months.","Praful Mehta","Yes. Exactly. That's what I would have got. So, thanks for confirming. And secondly, maybe on the credit point that you all made because you have all these opportunities for investment, and you will be conservative by the sounds of it on the financing side, just wanted to understand how the cash effective tax rate fits into that because it's helpful, on slide 34, you've indicated around a 5% cash tax rate. Is that something that you expect will stay around that level? Or you expect that to change? And would that put any pressure on the metrics over time?","Brian Tierney","So, we do expect the cash tax rate to be around that 5.25% going forward. Clearly, the flowback of the deferred taxes is a big use of our cash these days. But remember, we had gone in with this strong balance sheet before tax reform thinking we were going become a big payor of taxes. And now that we're not a big payor of taxes, we're a big flow backer of deferred income tax.","I don't think that's a word. But we are now flowing back significant amounts of deferred taxes. So, for this year, given the orders that we had, we had anticipated flowing back both protected and unprotected, about $267 million. We're now going to be flowing back about $330 million in 2019. Going forward, in the next three years, we anticipate that number being a lot closer to about $200 million.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. And that was a choice in terms of flowing back more this year given you have some room on the metrics?","Brian Tierney","It was a choice by our regulators.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. All right. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate the color.","Brian Tierney","Thanks Praful.","Bette Jo Rozsa","Thank you for joining us on today's call. And thank you all for the kind comments on the phone and all your emails. I'm a bit overwhelmed right now. And as always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Kevin, would you please give the replay information?","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Rich. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2017 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the Appendix of today's presentation.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome once again to AEP's third quarter 2017 earnings call. I know you all have probably seen the earnings release this morning. I just want to say from the outset, while primarily the weather has forced us to lower the midpoint of guidance for 2017 slightly, a deeper look at 2017 shows there is much to be positive about. This is exactly why we continue to reaffirm our 2018 guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share with a $3.85 midpoint still built around 5% to 7% growth from a 2017 $3.65 per share midpoint base. Additionally, our board recently approved a $0.03 per share dividend increase or 5.1% further, exhibiting the confidence in our ongoing business plan.","So, let me accentuate the positives here so that you can see what I see about this company and its prospects. First, despite having the mildest weather in the last 25 years that affected our normalized load forecast by $0.16 per share, we adjusted our midpoint of the 2017 guidance by only $0.03 per share, which is about the same as normalized weather was off of the third quarter.","I remember watching Game of Thrones over the summer thinking that Khaleesi's dragons need some heat \u2013 to bring some heat to heat the place up, but that never happened. Now, don't go add $0.13 per share to your models for next year but recognize that our employees can do what they can do to adjust in real-time when necessary as headwinds persist. We will make up lost ground by driving efficiency, eliminating expenses where practical and with negligible movement of expenses to 2018.","Additionally, we are seeing continued improvement in economy, which Brian will talk about later that gives us further confidence of a rebound in the future of all sections of our load. That means the robustness of 2018 and beyond is still intact, and 2017, while challenging, has been remarkably preserved in large part.","So, looking at the numbers for the quarter, AEP reported third quarter 2017 GAAP and operating or non-GAAP earnings, we call it now, of $1.11 per share and $1.10 per share, respectively, versus third quarter 2016 GAAP and operating earnings of a loss of $1.56 per share and positive $1.30 per share, respectively. This brings 2017 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.07 per share and $2.82 per share, respectively, versus 2016 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings of $0.48 per share and $3.25 per share, respectively.","We have narrowed the guidance range for 2017 to $3.55 to $3.68 per share to further define our guidance as we close out the year. And as I mentioned earlier, our board raised the dividend to $0.62 per share, a 5.1% increase that puts us solidly in our targeted 60% to 70% payout range.","Beyond the numbers, I know there are several areas you probably want to hear about. One is, first would be Wind Catcher Energy Connection. This project continues to move forward. As previously discussed, we filed for state regulatory approvals at the end of July. And we now have procedural schedules in all four state jurisdictions that lead to hearings in the first quarter of 2018: January in Oklahoma and Texas; February in Louisiana; and March in Arkansas. Wind Catcher represents a clear winner for customers, investors, economic development and the environment.","At this point, I should figuratively drop the microphone, but we'll let the facts, $4.5 billion invested, $7.6 billion in customer savings, substantial infrastructure development and great use of wind resources speak for themselves. So I'm pleased with the progress of Wind Catcher so far.","Moving on to our several rate cases to discuss and obviously, we're in a year of several rate cases. We got a summary on page 33, but at a high level, in Indiana, we filed a $263 million rate case of which $89 million is depreciation and amortization. The procedural schedule has been set with hearings in January. In Michigan, we filed a $51.7 million rate case with $23.4 million being depreciation and a procedural schedule has been set for those hearings this November and an order is expected in April of 2018.","The Kentucky rate case that was filed in June requested a $65.4 million increase, and is now in settlement discussions with the parties. Hearings were set for December of this year, so we expect the results soon with this case. The Oklahoma rate case was filed in June for approximately $170 million, inclusive of about $14 million of AMI and reliability that we were already recovering through riders. In September, staff recommended a $132 million increase and the hearings are scheduled in late October, early November with an ALJ report expected December.","As I mentioned last quarter, this case is extremely important with the outcome impacting future investment decisions in Oklahoma, including Wind Catcher. We are hopeful the Oklahoma Commission will send a positive message in this regard.","At SWEPCO last December, we filed a base rate case in Texas requesting $105.9 million, offset by $36.9 million of reductions in TCRF, Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, and DCRF, Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, revenues netting to $69 million. This case include environmental retrofits and remaining net plan investments in the retired Welsh 2 unit.","The ALJ in the case issued a decision in September, proposing a base rate increase of $51 million with a 9.6% ROE. We expect a PUCT decision by the end of the year on this case.","In Ohio, in late August, we filed a joint stipulation settlement agreement among the parties in the ESP 3 extension case. The agreement covered distribution investment and enhanced reliability rider-related issues as well as Smart City investments in technology, continued OVEC recovery and other matters. It allows a 10% ROE for rider-related capital and commits the company to file a rate case in June 2020. Hearings commence this next week. Proposals are also due to AEP Ohio in December for 400 megawatts of solar, so we're looking forward to further investment in this area as well.","Now, moving forward with the equalizer chart, overall, ROEs have come down from the previous quarter due to primarily weather, but also the pending rate case activity I just spoke about. With six different major rate cases, along with other regulatory activities, it has been quite a busy year. As I mentioned earlier, many of these cases do not get resolved until first quarter 2018, so we expect a gradual increase with ROEs for the fourth quarter. And then, in 2018, ROEs once again should be tracking approximately in the 10% overall range.","So, as I go across looking at each one of the jurisdictions, I refer you to page 5 of the equalizer chart. Obviously, we have our two bubbles for AEP Ohio and that really talks about the difference between those legacy issues that are accounted for in the 12.6% versus what we're truly experiencing, the 11.1% that would be involved with the SEET test. So the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the third quarter 2017 was 12.6%, and it reflects rate relief associated with our distribution investment program, shared savings attributed to our energy efficiency programs, and the annual transmission formula rate true-up in lowering financing costs.","The 12.6% ROE, as I said earlier, includes those legacy issues and the 11.1% does not, and that's the one that's evaluated for SEET-related activities. APCo, it has come down a little bit. At the end of the third quarter, it was 8.4%; in second quarter, it was 8.9%. And that really is driven primarily by weather and usage during that period. So in many of these, you'll see that as a sort of a crosscutting issue across the board is the weather-related activities associated with each one of these.","Kentucky, the ROE at the end of the third quarter was 4.5% and, as you know, we filed the rate case there back in July of 2017, so a new rate should be effective around the January timeframe in 2018. But that being said, the long-term strategy around Kentucky is also centered around economic development. We had a large aluminum company that announced location within the company's territory, and we believe that's going to be a foundational part of some ancillary additions in load that can help from an economic development standpoint. So that's really a two-pronged effort there and Matt Satterwhite, our President down there, is doing a great job turning that around.","I&M achieved an ROE of 8.4% at the end of the third quarter 2017. I&M's ROE has been impacted by weather, again, and formula base rate true-ups. I&M has filed base rate cases in both Indiana and Michigan, as I mentioned earlier, and those new rates are expected to be in place for both states in midyear 2018.","PSO, we've talked about, the ROE at the end of the third quarter was 6.1% and it's primarily driven by regulatory lag from the last rate case, hopefully we'll make up some ground on that, and unfavorable weather. So we expect the new rates of PSO to be in effect by January of 2018.","SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the third quarter was 5.9% and third quarter results were unfavorable because weather, again, but benefited from some lower O&M expense. SWEPCO also took a $6.3 million unfavorable adjustment due to the prior period income tax adjustment affecting the Dolet Hills Lignite Company subsidiary.","And of course, we've had the formula base rate that was approved by the Louisiana Commission kick in during that period as well. And then, of course, we have a Texas case that I talked about earlier that we're expecting an outcome soon on as well.","So moving on to AEP Texas, they are at a 10.3%. They have a steady ROE primarily attributable to increased revenues from the TCOS filing that was effective in late June, and then their Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing that was effective in September. So all is good in AEP Texas.","AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at third quarter has been 12.7%, primarily driven by 206 reserve which offsets most of the year-over-year rate base increase.","The other driving factor is a decrease in ETT ROE as a result of settlement filed with the PUCT in January 2017 but all in all, going very well from a transmission standpoint.","So with that discussion, obviously weather impacted just about every part of the system and then also we had hurricanes that hit. And I wanted to say \u2013 give a shout out to our employees and also the industry in terms of its support relative to Hurricane Harvey, Irma and others. This has been an interesting year from a weather perspective. So this quarter, once again, because of weather, we've been treading water, no pun intended.","But again, I'm very proud of the employees who have been involved with not only eliminating most of the deficit that's occurred because of weather reductions but also the work they did relative to really recovering our nation from some pretty substantial storms.","So, being a music buff, I can't help but recall the lyrics of a song by the group Dream Theater and which is one of my favorite drummers, Michael Portnoy and probably no one knows who they are but the song is called Another Day and the lyrics go \u2013 live another day, climb a little higher, find another reason to stay.","Well, in 2017, because of our efforts to overcome the weather and other obstacles, we'll finish out the year 2017, we'll live for 2018 and continue on our path of reaffirming guidance centered on $3.85 per share and our 5% to 7% growth rate. The fundamentals of our business plan remain secure and we're confident going into 2018. Brian?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and finish with a discussion of what we'll present at the EEI Conference.","Let's begin on slide 6 which shows that operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.10 per share or $543 million compared to $1.30 per share or $640 million in 2016. This difference can be primarily attributed to the sale of competitive generation assets and mild weather.","Let's look at the earnings drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.58 per share, down $0.13. The primary driver for this variance was cooler-than-normal weather this year compared to warmer weather last year. Other drivers in this segment include lower O&M and higher normalized retail margins, which were offset by higher depreciation and higher effective tax rate.","The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.29 per share for the quarter, down $0.03 from last year. Unfavorable drivers in this segment included a higher effective tax rate, weather in Texas, lower sales in Ohio and increased depreciation. Partially offsetting these items was recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers.","Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.15 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.01 over last year, reflecting a return on incremental investment. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by $1.1 billion, an increase of 30% since last September.","The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.07 per share, down $0.09 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of the competitive generating assets. Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, higher marketing revenues and lower overall expenses.","Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share from last year, primarily due to an investment gain and lower O&M.","Let's turn to slide 7, and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $2.82 per share or $1.4 billion compared to $3.27 per share or $1.6 billion in 2016. Similar to the quarter, this difference can primarily be attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of the competitive generation assets and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year. Offsetting these were transmission earnings and recovery of incremental investment.","Looking at the drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.27 per share, down $0.43, with the single largest driver being weather, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.22. Favorable prior year items contributed to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia and positive tax adjustments.","Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions. Additional variances in this segment include higher depreciation, lower AFUDC and lower retail margins, particularly in the East.","Through September, the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.76 per share, down $0.03. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes and higher ERCOT transmission revenue. These were offset by several items including lower normalized load, the reversal of the regulatory provision in 2016 and higher effective tax rates, depreciation and O&M.","AEP Transmission Holdco segment earnings through September were $0.56 per share, up $0.14 over last year. The growth in earnings included the implementation of deferred 205 forecasted transmission rates. This allowed for a one-time increase from historical expense true-ups to future-looking estimated expenses to be trued up in the subsequent period. This one-time adjustment will not be repeated in future periods.","We experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement earlier this year. The growth in earnings over last year also reflects a return on incremental investment.","The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.25 per share, down $0.15 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of the competitive generating assets, as expected. Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, positive impacts from solar projects going into service and lower overall costs.","Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.02 per share from last year due to investment gains and tax adjustments.","For the year-to-date period, certain unfavorable comparisons to 2016 were anticipated, like the sale of the competitive generating assets and other favorable 2016 items. In response to the earnings impact from very mild weather, which continued into the third quarter, we have reduced O&M expenses compared to last year for the fourth quarter of this year. Because of the continued impact of weather and the fact that we have one quarter remaining in the year, as Nick said, we are narrowing our 2017 guidance range to $3.55 per share to $3.68 per share. Also as Nick said earlier, we anticipate growing at 5% to 7% off of our original 2017 guidance range and are reaffirming our 2018 operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share in 2018.","Now, let's look at slide 8 to review normalized load performance. Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales decreased by 0.3% this quarter and we're down 0.2% for the year. For both comparisons, the growth in the industrial sector was offset by declining residential and commercial sales. Had it not been for the outages caused by Hurricane Harvey, our normalized sales would be flat for both the quarter and year-to-date periods.","Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 1.9% for both the third quarter and year-to-date comparisons. We saw strong industrial sales growth across most of our operating companies and industries this quarter. The positive industrial performance these past two quarters are good indicators of future growth in our residential and commercial classes as the economic recovery works its way through our service territory.","In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and down 1.5% year-to-date. Story here differs by geography. Residential sales were up 0.5% in our Western footprint, where customer accounts increased by 0.7% in the third quarter. In the East, however, residential sales declined by 3%, where customer accounts were essentially flat.","Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 1.3%, bringing the year-to-date normalized contraction to 0.7%.","Turning to slide 9, let's take a deeper look at some of the indicators that were responsible for the stronger industrial load performance this year. The chart at the top illustrates why we are confident with the trend for this class. Since 2013, the majority of AEP industrial sales has been concentrated in the oil and gas sectors in AEP shale regions. While it was good to have growth from the energy sector, there was a concern that the industrial mix was becoming unbalanced as non-energy-related sales struggled. This concern was evident last year when energy prices fell, and the majority of our service territory fell into recession.","As of the third quarter, all of our operating companies are now out of recession and in recovery mode for the first time since 2011. In addition, over the past two quarters, there is no longer a distinction between growth in the oil and gas and the rest of our industrial sectors. This balance is indicative of a healthier base from which AEP's economy can grow.","The bottom left chart helps explain why we experienced recent improvement in the non-oil and gas sectors. The chart shows the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the broad index of other currencies. In 2016, the strong dollar and weak global demand were significant headwinds for manufacturing in AEP service territory.","Fortunately, the global economy is in a much better position in 2017 and the dollar has started to soften over the past two quarters, which coincides with the growth in industrial sales shown above. The current dollar index is the lowest it's been since 2015.","The table in the bottom right corner shows some of the major export industries located in AEP's footprint that are benefiting from the weaker dollar. In total, these sectors represent nearly half of AEP's industrial sales.","With that, let's review the status of our regional economies on slide 10. As shown in the upper left chart, our Eastern territory grew by 3.2% this quarter, which was 1.1% faster than the U.S. Our Western territory grew at 1.9%, which was a significant improvement from previous quarters.","Looking at the growth in our East Vertically Integrated Utilities in the upper right chart, Kentucky Power remains the fastest growing territory in terms of GDP growth, notching an increase of 3.1% for the quarter.","As you know, Kentucky Power's territory has a higher concentration of coal mining, which is growing for the first time in years. Appalachian Power's territory also has a high concentration of mining and is experiencing a similar trend, growing at 2.5%.","Despite its GDP growth of 2.5%, Indiana Michigan Power has actually experienced sales declines in all three retail classes. Exposure to the automotive industry, which had a record-setting year in 2016, has moderated somewhat this year.","The bottom left chart shows our West Vertically Integrated Utilities where SWEPCO's service territory saw 1.6% growth for the quarter. As expected, PSO came out of recession this quarter experiencing GDP growth of 0.6% driven by improvement in the oil and gas activity.","Finally, the bottom right chart shows that both of our Transmission & Distribution Utilities continue to improve in the third quarter, with the growth in Ohio approximately 1% above that in Texas.","The Ohio service territory is more diversified with growth coming from many sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, and education and health services. Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum of these economic trends in our service territory.","Now, let's move to slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt-to-total capital ratio increased 0.1% during the quarter to 54.6%. Our FFO-to-debt ratio is solidly in the BBB+ and Baa1 range at 17.4% and our net liquidity stands at about $3 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility.","Our qualified pension funding improved approximately 1 percentage point to 100%. Plan assets increased due to strong returns and plan liabilities were essentially flat due to relatively stable interest rates.","Our OPEB funding improved 2 percentage points during the quarter to 112%, with investment gains outpacing plan benefit payments and expenses. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans for 2017 is expected to be unchanged from last year at about $15 million.","Finally, our Treasury group continues to take advantage of robust low-cost debt capital markets to fund our spending program. In back-to-back weeks this quarter, we issued $700 million in senior notes for AEP Texas and $625 million in senior notes for AEP Transco.","The 30-year spread on the Transco deal of T plus 100 basis points (25:53) was the lowest issuance spread for an AEP company since before the financial crisis and equal to the lowest for any utility senior unsecured 30-year notes since the start of 2015.","Let's try to wrap this up on slide 12 and get to your questions. Despite the significant impact of mild weather on this year's earnings, we were able to find offsetting expense reductions that allow us to narrow operating earnings guidance within the original range to between $3.55 to $3.68 per share. Significant portion of those O&M savings will occur in the fourth quarter. Given our ability to put capital to work, serving our customers, we are also confident in reaffirming our 2018 operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. We are also confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate.","As we always do, we will provide specifics with our presentation at the fall EEI Financial Conference. We will detail the drivers behind next year's earnings guidance. We will also provide detail around our capital expenditure plans, rate activity, cash flow and a more specific annual financing plan than we have provided in prior years. We look forward to seeing many of you in Orlando in about 10 days.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will start with the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Congratulations on holding the line here on costs. Yeah, talk about it. Bring those dragons.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We need them.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know. Oh man. Let me ask you real quickly if I can, on \u2013 let's just start with the weather really quickly. You talk about not exactly adding back that $0.13 year-over-year, how would you think about it? Obviously, you didn't change the 2017 number as much, just to hit that directly out of the gate here.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, when we look at the $0.13 \u2013 we're looking at this year like it is an anomaly. We're not doing anything stupid for reducing an O&M perspective. We are doing the tree trimming, we're doing all the things we need to do. But there is one-time things that we can do whether it's travel, whether it's all those kinds of things that employees can do to reduce costs and the efficiencies that we've seen from all the previous years' activities continue to inure to the benefit of O&M as well.","So there's some opportunities for us to really respond to the weather-related activity. But keep in mind, we're very careful, we didn't want to move a bunch of stuff from 2017 into 2018 because there's things we need to do in 2017 and we want to keep the plan secure for 2018. So we really looked at it in that fashion. When you look at the weather and if it's weather adjusted $0.13, not all of it, so I think you do have some opportunity next year. I think it just makes us more confident about the midpoint for next year, particularly assuming we get any kind of normal weather.","It would be great if we had a good winter before we had a bad summer or a good summer after we had a bad winter, but we had neither. And so all of the plans aligned negatively this year but to come out of it the way that we have I think really does show the ability to change our O&M profile to respond to it. I don't know, Brian, do you have anything you want to add to that?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No. We've kept O&M that's now been tracked flat essentially for the last seven years. And it's been lean activity, procurement activity, continuous improvement activity and we are advancing that activity and when we have the weather gap that we had this year, this management team knows what levers to pull to fill in that gap and we are not going to resort to gimmicks like factoring weather out. We know we're responsible for responding to what the weather is and trying to come in within our guidance range and that's exactly what this team has done.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Today, it's a different company than we had two years or three years ago with the unregulated generation. Today, I think it's much more transparent and the levers that you have to pull are still there in some regards, but weather will be more of a impact on the company than in previous years because then you had the market conditions that you could look at, and sometimes it saved you, sometimes it went against you, but that's all part of the process of making sure that we're consistent as we can be regardless of the situation.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thanks for the detail. Quick to follow-up on cleanup item here, we've seen some headlines around Oklaunion here. Can you comment just on, I presume that's fairly negligible in terms of earnings contribution to the extent which you were to transact on that? And presumably if you were, that would be all of it, that would not be any kind of specific portion of it? And then perhaps, in tandem with that, any thoughts here on Conesville given that the transfer has been completed for \u2013 a little bit here?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, obviously, we're still looking at the unregulated generation from a strategic sense and Oklaunion has been a drag, particularly on the unregulated side, in the ERCOT portion of Texas. And just like any other base load generation, I don't think it gets the value it deserves for what it provides to the market. But that being said, yeah, any kind of result that we get out of Oklaunion, I wouldn't expect too much of a financial change as a result.","And then as far as Conesville is concerned, we continue to look at that, we consolidate some interests in some of the units, but we continue to look at our options from that perspective as well.","And really I didn't talk about those upfront in any of the areas, but just know that we continue to work with Buckeye and Cardinal and then of course, seeing what the disposition of those units can be in relation to all the other opportunities that we have but there's no doubt we continue our process of that strategic review.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And just to clarify what this all meshes together to for your 2019, if you think about as you roll forward a few years that $0.10 of call it non-core utility earnings, the composition that is largely renewable by that point in time, or just how would you think about that given where you are in the plan on both the deployment of capital on the new generation assets as well as obviously getting rid of the legacy stuff?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Oh, yeah, absolutely, Brian, do you want to...","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah. So hedges that we have associated with our competitive generation and capacity revenues decline over time. And earnings from the renewable portion increases over time. Overall, we don't expect that business to be changing much from about the $0.10 contribution of earnings that it has in the near term.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So if you look at 2018, 2019, 2020, you're seeing minimization of the contributions of the old legacy units, but we're maximizing the contribution of the renewables efforts, particularly in Chuck Zebula's area, the contracted renewables, but also very much so the regulated renewables. And as I mentioned earlier, we have an RFP out in AEP Ohio for solar and then, of course, Wind Catcher. You're going to see other projects like that, that are going to be drivers for those future years and we're very much looking forward to it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you all very much.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll now go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I've had just a question about the Transmission segment and obviously, you didn't provide for the quarter much a breakdown of the $0.01 of growth, but it seemed to be little slower than you've generally been seeing on investment growth. So I was curious, did you take any additional reserve against 206, or anything like that this quarter or just what's behind that $0.01?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","So we did take reserve against the 206 for the quarter. For the year, contributing to that $0.14 improvement is the \u2013 what we're able to do in the FERC 205 as we're able to look at forward-looking O&M test years rather than truing up past years. And that contributed to the growth but we're pretty much on track with where we expected to be for the Transmission Holdco segment.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","You're going to see an anomaly with the credit of the 205. That's really some of what you're seeing, too, the true up associated with it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So that's the $0.09 that you're talking about on a year-to-date basis?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And \u2013 but the \u2013 you're now reserved to the level that you think is a reasonable outcome for the 206 beyond the reserve you took earlier in the year, I guess?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We are, Jon.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That's right.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","And we think that issue is going to play out over a fairly long period of time with what's going on with the New England Transmission Owners case and its remand back to FERC. We think we'll be in a long period of having to reserve before that issue gets resolved.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. And what drives the decision to up the reserve right now?","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah, I don't think it's been an increase in the reserve. I think we've been steady about where it's been and have kept it held at that level. I think there are positive things to come out of the new FERC makeup and we're just going to hold steady for \u2013 until it gets resolved.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But I thought you just said you did increase the reserve and that's why you didn't have growth this quarter, but now it sounds like maybe you didn't.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","We did not increase the reserve. It's been steady. It's been constant.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No, we didn't increase it, but the true-up hits in July. That's what happened.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just one other, on Wind Catcher, we noticed earlier this week that Xcel proposed some sort of different terms to how they might look to get recovery in Texas. And I don't know if you have any comment on that \u2013 the base or framework or if you think that could end up being a template for how things might play for you?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","No. I don't see it that way because these projects are pretty unique and the way you look at them, and ours has a 350-mile, 765kV generation interconnection associated with it, but it's also massively larger. So you can look at the risk being taken and the economics of the projects themselves. They stand on their own merits. So we filed our plan. I know that Xcel had to change theirs a little bit, but that's sort of their business and our projects are our business. So we'll continue with all four jurisdictions in the same manner in which we filed and we'll see where it goes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I think that's it. Thank you, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Hi, Praful. Good to see you.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, same here. Just following up on Wind Catcher, I wanted to understand, of the $2.5 billion benefit that you've highlighted for the first 10 years, how important is that PTC? And do you see any risk to that PTC flowing through to the project itself?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","That PTC is really important and that's why the brevity in which we're asking for approvals of this project are instrumental. I mean, the numbers stand for themselves. The numbers are just, like I said earlier, a slam dunk. But when you look at the $2.5 billion PTC, that's a huge part of the economics associated with making sure our customers can benefit from that so \u2013 and timing is critical.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So I guess, when do we get color on like the likelihood of the timing? And what kind of risks does it bring to the approvals, I guess?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yes. So, obviously, we filed \u2013 and I'm really actually happy that the procedural schedules have been set up pretty consistent and constructive of getting a solution in place. I mean, all four jurisdictions have procedural schedules that match-up to sort of our April timeframe that we're looking at, so that we can really take a hard look at what the risks are, what the rewards will be, what the result of the Commission's orders will be. That will give us some real insight in terms of this project. But like I said before, I'm pleased with the progress that's been made.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Praful, you may...","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough.","Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Praful, you may not have gotten to it, yet, but slide 32 of our presentation, we kind of lay out the timeline in each of the jurisdictions and when we expect hearings to begin. And you can anticipate orders shortly after those hearings take place.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. And then in terms of the pending rate cases, obviously, you have a pretty busy regulatory schedule. Just wanted to understand, your ROEs for all these rate cases are in the 10% to 10.5% range, is there any risk given current interest rate environment on those ROEs? Or do you see those ROEs \u2013 authorized ROEs to be pretty stable?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","I think we are pretty consistent, as we talked earlier about 2018 being in that approximately 10% range, and of course, it's going to result from negotiations or from the outcomes of these cases.","And so as we look at it, the aggregation of those cases will be in that approximate 10% range, that's what you should look for. And of course, we filed \u2013 the normal course of rate cases. I mean, you file based upon what we really believe the ROE should be and then, the course, you have to deal with other parties and deal with the \u2013 and the Commission itself will make the decision on what the ultimate ROE is. And like I said earlier, we expect our aggregated to be around that 10% range.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks so much, guys.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we'll now go to the line of John Barta with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Good morning, John.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to better understand how interrelated the wind plant and gen-tie for Wind Catcher are, were hypothetically, is the capital associated with the wind side were reduced a little bit? Is the need still there for the 765 kilovolt gen-tie?","Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Oh, yeah, they go hand-in-hand. Obviously, you would be building a huge wind farm to nowhere if you don't have the generation interconnection there. And so with \u2013 and with 2,000 megawatts of wind capacity at that location, that drives a pretty large substantial generation interconnection. And even if you \u2013 in this case, you won't reduce the size of it, but the size of the wind farm is really the big driver on the capacity side associated with the size of the generation interconnect. So they go hand-in-hand. One doesn't occur without the other and that's why it's all being viewed as a single project. And that's why we're working really hard to lock in the arrangements associated with construction on both sides, so that we can eliminate as much risk as possible.","John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's it.","Operator","And we have exhausted all questions in queue at this time. Please continue.","Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.","Okay, well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Rich, would you please give the replay information.","Operator","Certainly.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Julie Sherwood. Please go ahead.","Julie Sherwood","Thank you, Ernie. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2013 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, aep.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Nick.","Nicholas K. Akins","Thanks, Julie. So thanks to everyone for joining us today. The second quarter, while in space may seem uneventful, there have been some significant developments that warrant further discussion and define the mile post for future action. The challenges we face with the economy, capacity markets and an industry in transition provide the forcing functions for change. That is exactly what our management team and this company intends to do, face these challenges head on and provide the tools for our employees to be agile and adapt to an ever-changing environment.","So from the outset, the financial measures for the quarter were on track and respectable and have not changed our plans for the year or our guidance that has been previously provided. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.69 per share and $0.73 per share from an operating earnings perspective, which was slightly less than the $0.77 per share for second quarter 2012. So year-to-date puts us at $1.44 per share GAAP earnings and $1.53 per share operating, while again, it's slightly less than last year.","The difference in GAAP versus operating earnings primarily is the net of an impairment related to Muskingum River 5, which should not clear the PJM capacity market, and the benefit of a Supreme Court ruling regarding the tax benefits related to a U.K. windfall profits tax.","Our board yesterday did approve the quarterly payment of a dividend to investors of record of $0.49 per share, which is AEP's 413th consecutive quarter of paying a dividend. So steady as you go is from the board perspective.","With the basic financial numbers for the quarter out of the way, I want to give you my perspective on the challenges we face and what we're doing about them. But first, let me cut to the chase. We are reaffirming our guidance range for 2013 of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. And despite the challenges before us, we still maintain expected long-term earnings growth rate of between 4% and 6%, albeit the results of the 2016-17 PJM capacity auction has tested our business case for the upside beyond this range. But through capital allocation, particularly the transmission, regulatory recoveries for it and performance improvements that benefit our customers, operations and bottom line performance, our management team is committed to living up to the 4% to 6% expectation.","Too many times, we equate only load growth with earnings expectations. While that equation may still be partially true, our businesses change. It is more about optimization, performance improvement and disciplined capital and operating expense management that is driven by a culture of optimism and expectation that we can get the job done, and we will. So let me discuss some of the challenges I see.","An economy that continues to be tenuous at best, I think you're seeing this all across the country. And for the past quarter, industrial load in our footprint has continued to be down, commercial load was down slightly and residential load held flat. Brian will discuss the numbers in detail. But because margins are different by rate class, financially, the impact was only $0.02 per share year-on-year, if you look at those traditional retail footprints. But with the addition of Generation and Marketing adding $0.04 per share, which includes our retail earnings, actually, the performance, the financial performance of serving load is up.","So now let's take a look at the regulatory recovery support. The asset transfer cases in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia are moving along. In Kentucky, a nonunanimous settlement was filed that provides for the transfers of Mitchell, as planned, with recovery of Big Sandy-related conversion cost. In Virginia, we have made the case of the Wheeling merger along with the Mitchell transfers in the public interest, as well as the transfer of Amos. And in West Virginia, we just concluded hearings that we feel confident we demonstrated our case for the transfer of Amos and Mitchell, along with the Wheeling merger, that's in the best interest of customers.","Why do we believe we just put an -- put on excellent cases in these jurisdictions? These are fully controlled units that are least cost options that provide a secure supply to customers for the future in lieu of the capacity payments that were paid through the AEP pool to the other operating companies. We believe we have strong cases and will soon find out the outcomes with the first order expected from Virginia by Wednesday, followed by West Virginia and Kentucky during the third quarter.","A SWEPCO Texas rate case order related to Turk is expected in third quarter. That will be retroactive to late January 2013. And Brian will discuss this timing issue in our second quarter reporting on this subject. We're hopeful that the PUCT, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, will see beyond the shortsightedness of the ALJ decision in this case, particularly as it relates to the notion that we should have stopped construction of Turk late in the game. This is tantamount to hindsight regulation and should be rejected by the Texas commissioners.","The PUCT commissioners need to send a strong message that Texas jurisdictional capacity can get built and recovered in a state that desperately needs capacity. Customers are benefiting from an exceptional generating unit that is 15% more efficient, the new supercritical unit in the country, and thereby saving customers considerable fuel cost. This is a win for Texas customers and should be a forward to recovery in the ROE that is deserved for this major investment, and sub 10% isn't reasonable.","In Indiana, 2 positive developments have occurred that further improved the recovery of the life cycle management program at Cook and the recovery of the dry sorbent injection equipment at Rockport. The $1.169 billion, less about $23 million of incremental upsizing costs, were approved for recovery, which was $741 million jurisdictional to Indiana and allowed the deferral of other project-related costs for future recovery related to the life cycle management programs. So very good outcome in Indiana in this regard.","Regarding the Rockport DSI projects, just yesterday, a settlement agreement was filed to allow the full recovery of the dry sorbent injection systems. 80% would be through a tracker and 20% deferred for the next rate case. So another great outcome. Also, at Flint Creek, we received an order earlier in this month to allow recovery of the scrubber installation, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved that.","So now let's talk about performance improvement. I'm CEO of AEP, but many of you may know I'm also a rock drummer. And one of the biggest challenges -- I know that's hard to believe, but it's -- one of the biggest challenges for a beginning drummer is to separate the movement of the right hand and the right foot. At first, it's not natural. But after practice, it becomes second nature in its reaction to play and react to different kinds of music.","I tell you that because too many times we assume that work has to be performed one way or even the old way only to find out there are better and more efficient ways of improving processes and while reducing operating expenses. This is what we're doing in AEP. Too many times, we assume performance improvement is only about cost cutting. Therefore, we think that expense reductions are not sustaining. This is just not true.","I've been involved with just about every operational business function in this company. And what our employees are doing to reinvent this company is truly phenomenal. So I've decided to give you a little insight to help you understand our sustainability initiative and what we're doing relative to our ability to adjust to this changing environment that we operate in, particularly with the questions about capacity markets, load forecasts and so forth.","We estimate that we'll exceed our expense reduction revenue enhancement targets for 2013 through our repositioning engaged to gain employee programs, while increasing O&M spend in specific areas of prioritization, such as transmission, cyber, retail and other things. So I think it's important to note that we are being mindful that we need to add O&M in certain places and prioritize the areas and, at the same time, achieve the O&M objectives we've set out for ourselves for the year.","So far, as well, our 3 plants, who have gone through the lean processes, have been just transformational for these generating plants. We've achieved between $5 million and $10 million of savings per plant in this analysis. And that process hasn't ended. The third plant is only in its eighth week of doing these lean initiatives, and it's just amazing the kind of things they come up with.","And oh, by the way, next year, we'll have 6 to 8 plants about this time going through the same process. And we have between 15 and 20 plants to go through this process. So it's important to note that we are far from done and a lot more work to do, but a lot more savings when there is a benefit as we go forward.","We've executed a supply chain RFP that generates substantial savings in the tens of millions of dollars just by going out for bid with our repositioning programs, standardize some equipment specs and enabled us to do that kind of buying. And typically, we haven't done that in years. But we've now done that, and it will provide tremendous benefits.","We've also done things in the -- like changing limestone specs and suppliers, lowering auxiliary loads and minimum loads at power plants, and the list goes on and on. But it's also a work in progress, and there's many savings initiatives yet to follow.","We would not have increased O&M in some areas if we believed that second quarter O&M timing issues were a problem. We're putting a culture of continuous improvement in place that will achieve savings this year and, yes, will help mitigate the impact of the 2016-17 capacity auction results. Chuck Zebula will be also looking at this business like a private equity investor with the help of generation employees and corporate to reduce expenses commensurate with what the capacity market dictates.","AEP has issues with this regulatory construct we sometimes call a capacity market in PJM. This version of socialism that equates DSM and nonfirm transmission with reliable and capital-intensive steel in the ground is really just capitalism in a sandbox, where the rules seem to penalize long-term investors. This has to change or we'll eventually have a doughnut, with PJM being the empty middle, and reliability will suffer. PJM is fully aware of our concerns and, hopefully, will react accordingly because change is desperately needed.","Regarding President Obama's speech, I'll refer to Page 5 of the presentation. And in that, you'll see -- I was actually -- when I heard the President's speech, it was a little different than what the actual write-up of what the initiative was. In the write-up, it had talked about things like clean coal, natural gas, nuclear renewables, electric vehicles with the eGallon approach, which I find pretty intriguing to talk about the dollar per gallon equivalent for the electricity side of things, and transmission was discussed.","So for that perspective, it was a balanced approach. But I guess the proof comes with what the administration will do and the EPA will do as a result of some of the activities they're going through. It's certainly clear that they need to be consistent and reasonable in their approach. And I think that, as you can see from the Page 5, our 2015 estimate shows that we'll exceed even the Waxman-Markey litigation targets of 17% by 2020 because of coal retirements, coal-to-gas switching and energy efficiency and renewable resources, as well as transmission optimization. The industry itself has already achieved 16% reduction because of these activities. So this is not a time to really impair the economy even further.","The mercury rules and the natural gas revolution has already achieved the objectives that we've set out to try to make consistent progress, and commensurate with the Waxman-Markley limitations before. So there's no reason to further cripple the economic recovery of this nation by adding -- or even adding a larger burden of onerous greenhouse gas requirements that further jeopardize the economic recovery and even the electric grid itself.","I believe that Gina McCarthy, the Head of EPA, will be more responsible and reasonable, particularly with what has already been achieved with the mercury rules, where certainly we're seeing more retirements related to that, much more than even the EPA had anticipated. So hopefully, we'll wind up in a -- with a reasonable solution that we can work forward with, particularly as it relates to existing units. We have proposed an efficiency top of requirement. And certainly, we have striven with our plants to find more efficiency gains, and we continue to do that.","Lastly, I'll point you to my favorite graph, which is back on Page 4. I know there's been some comments earlier this morning about this, but this is a 12-month ROE view. And as we look at this thing, APCo is continuing to improve. We expect that to continue to improve. I&M has a rate case that was completed that's not fully reflected in these numbers, so its ROE will certainly improve upwards toward 10% in the coming year. And then, as we look at SWEPCO, the SWEPCO rate case in Texas, it's retroactive back to the end of January.","So when you -- and Brian will talk about this, the AFUDC part of the analysis versus what's actually going to happen when the rates become effective and are retroactive back to that point. So wouldn't you expect SWEPCO to move up toward the 9%, 9-plus range? So we continue to see improvement in those areas, and it's really because of the capital intensiveness, but also the cases that have either been completed, are waiting for an order from the commissions or just haven't been fully reflected in these numbers. So we continue to be optimistic about how this chart will look as we go forward in the year.","So with that, I'd have to say that, overall, the second quarter has been a typical second quarter, weather dependent, load dependent. But as you know, the third and fourth quarter is where AEP certainly sees the benefits of not only the timing related to O&M, but also from the earnings standpoint, what occurs during the rest of the year, during the hot season and the cold season.","So again, thank you very much for attending. And I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian X. Tierney","Thank you, Nick. And good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 6 with the reconciliation of this year's second quarter to last year's. As you can see, American Electric Power's operating earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter as compared to $0.77 per share last year.","As I will discuss, this decline of $0.04 is explained by the effect of certain Ohio transition items, with our regulated businesses showing a net favorable impact for the period. The largest item adversely affecting the quarter-over-quarter comparison includes a combination of certain Ohio transition items that were unfavorable, $0.09 per share. This effect on earnings included the reversal of a prior period fuel provision last year worth $0.05 per share and lower capacity payments from competitive suppliers totaling $0.04 per share.","Operations and maintenance expenses, net of offsets, increased slightly, adversely affecting earnings by $0.05 per share. The higher expense levels were driven primarily by additional spending associated with storm restoration and incremental plant outage work performed in 2013.","We continue to focus on controlling our expenses across all functions, particularly overhead costs, and expect to see this impact back-end loaded in 2013. We anticipate that O&M, net of offsets, will be close to flat when compared to 2012 on an annual basis. We will discuss this more later.","Weather played an unfavorable role in our quarterly earnings comparison. Temperatures were milder across all of our jurisdictions, adversely affecting results by $0.04 per share. However, weather was $0.02 per share favorable versus normal.","Allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, was up $0.03 per share in 2013 versus 2012, due primarily to the startup of the Turk plant in December of 2012. With the inclusion of Turk in Louisiana and FERC wholesale rates currently and with the anticipated rate order in Texas, this item will be offset in rate relief as the year progresses. Other items in total were unfavorable by $0.03 per share and include lower results from River Operations segment due to weaker market conditions and challenging operating results.","Regulated retail load was down from the prior period, adversely affecting the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. This decline is being driven by lower commercial and industrial sales, and we'll talk about this later more as well.","Items positively affecting the quarter-over-quarter comparison include continued growth in our Transmission Operations business for $0.02 per share and higher interest income for the quarter of $0.06 per share. This latter item is largely the interest income component of the favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling associated with the U.K. windfall profit tax treatment. The operating income treatment here is consistent with how we have previously treated this component of the case. The positive benefit of the tax credit itself is being treated as nonoperating and is also consistent with prior period treatment.","Finally, rate changes were favorable by $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2013 and are the result of rate activity across multiple of our jurisdictions.","Turning our attention to the year-to-date comparison on Slide 7. You can see that the company's operating earnings for this year were $1.53 per share compared to $1.57 per share last year. I'll focus my remarks on the significant differences from the quarterly explanations.","Adverse year-to-date comparisons include the Ohio transition items that were unfavorable $0.20 per share. O&M expenses, net of offsets, and River Operations were negative for the year-to-date, reasons similar to the quarterly comparison. And the effective tax rate was negative by $0.05 per share. The tax rate difference was driven by positive prior year tax adjustments that were not repeated in 2013, as well as unfavorable book-to-tax differences, which are accounted for on a flow-through basis.","On the positive side of the ledger, the most significant contributor to the other category, which was up $0.03 per share, was the Generation and Marketing segment, which Nick had mentioned earlier. Transmission operations and interest income were up a combined $0.09 per share for reasons similar to the quarterly comparison. And in contrast to the second quarter results, weather through June was favorable compared to the year-to-date in 2012 by $0.07 per share. Weather was favorable by $0.04 per share relative to normal. Finally, rate changes were favorable by $0.21 per share in the first half of 2013 versus 2012, with the improvement again coming from multiple of our jurisdictions.","In summary, we continue to face the challenge of offsetting the unfavorable effect of Ohio transition items, but remain on track to achieve our earnings guidance range for 2013. I'll remind you that the Ohio transition items were included in our guidance for the year. We're clearly being challenged in the area of regulated load, but expect to exceed our forecast in other areas.","As we always do, we will continue to manage our businesses and adjust accordingly as we work our way through the year. We are confident we are on track to deliver results within the stated guidance range, and we will discuss this again in more detail later.","As I mentioned earlier, I'd like to spend some time looking at our regulated load so far this year. Turning to Slide 8, you can see in the lower right-hand quadrant that weather-normalized load was down 2.7% for the quarter and 2.1% for the year-to-date period. The decline in both periods was driven by lower industrial sales.","Residential sales were close to flat for the quarter, but the year-to-date results were driven by strong results in the first quarter. The residential class, shown in the upper left quadrant, was comparable to last year's second quarter, down just 0.1%. Year-to-date residential sales show a favorable 0.7% increase as compared to the same period last year. We continue to see some modest residential customer growth of 0.7% in our Western service territories, but none to speak of in our Eastern areas.","In the upper right-hand quadrant, you can see the 2.1% decline in commercial sales for the quarter. Year-to-date, commercial sales were down only 0.9%, aided by stronger results in the first quarter. Our sales to commercial customers have been the strongest in Texas and Ohio, where growth is being driven by stronger employment growth.","Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you can see the declines I mentioned earlier, where industrial sales are down 5.3% for the quarter and 5.7% year-to-date. If you exclude the effect of our largest customer, which has been operating at reduced levels, the declines would have been 3.1% and 3.3% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.","While not minimizing the importance of these declines, it's important to note that the effect on gross margin associated with declines in industrial class is less than in other classes. The average realization from industrial customers is less than half that of residential customers, and a larger portion of the rate is driven by demand charges that adjust to lower levels on a lagging basis. Because of this, we are not alarmed, from an earnings standpoint, by overall load being down relative to forecast. As Nick alluded to earlier, the mix of load and margin differences result in overall year-to-date earnings only being off $0.02 per share, despite a year-to-date normalized load decrease of 2.1%.","As I have done on previous calls, I'll pause here to share some economic indicators for AEP. The company's service territory continues to experience stronger growth than the U.S. in terms of GDP, although the growth is not evenly distributed. For the quarter, GDP growth in AEP's Western footprint was 2.7% compared to 1.8% growth in the Eastern part of AEP's territory. That's compared to an estimated 1.9% growth for the U.S. in aggregate.","Unemployment for AEP's total service territory at 7.1% is still lower than it is for the U.S. as a whole at 7.6%. Employment growth for the U.S. has finally caught up with growth within AEP's territory, after having lagged behind since the start of the recession. Job growth in AEP's Western footprint of 1.5% is identical to that for the U.S. as a whole. Estimates for job growth in our Eastern service territory moderated this quarter to an increase of 0.8%.","Let's turn to Slide 9, where you'll find load trends for the quarter from our 5 largest industrial sectors. Our largest sector, primary metals, was down 16% from last year's second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the curtailed production at our largest customer -- and excluding that effect, this sector would have been down closer to 8%. We are seeing other customers reducing operations until market conditions improve, and some are taking advantage of this situation to retool their operations and add efficiencies for their ultimate return to operation.","Chemical manufacturing was down 2.6% for the quarter. This decline was widespread across our service area, with the exception of Texas. Even with low natural gas prices, market demand remains soft.","Petroleum and coal products were up 1.2% for the quarter versus the same period last year, reflecting a new refinery in Texas that reached full capacity in June of 2012. Two refineries were down for maintenance in the first quarter. Excluding those customers, this sector would be up 3.5% for the year.","The mining sector, excluding oil and gas, was down 1.2% for the quarter. This continuing decline reflects the effect of recent mild winters, low natural gas prices and low utility demand. Approximately 90% of AEP's mining load is located in our Eastern footprint.","Paper manufacturing was up 2.5% for the quarter, driven by higher demand in Ohio that more than offset lower demand in the West. Although not in our top 5 sectors, we also continue to see growing sales in the oil and gas extraction and the pipeline transportation sectors, driven by continued expansion related to shale gas activity.","Slide 10 provides an opportunity to update you on the financial health of American Electric Power. Our debt to total capitalization remains very healthy at 55.2%. This ranks among the lowest levels for the company in recent history. Our credit metrics, the FFO interest coverage and FFO to total debt, are solidly BBB and Baa2 at 4.5x and 19.1%, respectively. Our net available liquidity stands at nearly $3.5 billion and is underpinned by our 2 revolving credit facilities and our parent term loan credit facility.","In order to be able to obtain a private letter ruling on the tax-free nature of our pending corporate separation, we terminated that company term loans facility and reinstated the same program at the subsidiary level. Now Ohio Power, AEP Generation Resources, Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power will be the direct borrowers of the facility. The size and tenor of the facility remain unchanged. And due to the ratings of the subsidiaries, transaction costs should be recovered by reduced borrowing costs.","On the bottom left side of the slide, you'll see that our qualified pension liability is nearly fully funded at 97%. This is a result of aggressive funding over the last 3 years and this year's higher discount rate. In addition, due to the changes that were made last year on our post-retirement medical plans for future retirees, as well as higher discount rates, our other post-employment benefit liability is now fully funded.","And finally, this week, we priced our inaugural securitization for American Electric Power in Ohio. Specifically, $267 million of securitization bonds comprised of $165 million with a weighted average life of 2.25 years and $102 million with a weighted average of just over 5 years were priced at a duration weighted yield of approximately 1.59%. The closing date for the issuance is scheduled for August 1.","This marks additional progress in our 2013 financing plan and is particularly beneficial to AEP for 2 reasons: first, we strengthen our balance sheet as we transition a regulatory asset into cash; and second, we ease the burden on our customers, who realize a substantial reduction in the carrying charge on the regulatory assets. The net present value of the savings to the customer is estimated to be nearly $24 million.","The management and board remain committed to the financial health of the company, as exhibited by the items that you see on Slide 10. We will continue to demonstrate O&M discipline, careful capital allocation and thoughtful access of the debt capital markets.","Let me spend some time on Slide 11 talking about our recent success in reducing the baseline utility operations and maintenance expenses in recent years. We focus on the base spend because we had been successful in getting certain O&M items placed into trackers, with contemporaneous revenue increases for rate-making purposes.","From 2010 through estimated year end of 2013, the compounded annual growth rate for the company's base O&M spend has been negative 2.9%. This spending discipline did not happen by accident. The employees of AEP have been hard at work on repositioning the company for the competitive environment we are facing.","In 2013, we formalized the program and engaged our employees to focus on 5 distinct areas of efficiency improvements, cost-saving initiatives and revenue enhancement programs. In addition to the examples Nick provided earlier in the call, another example of the progress our employees have made is in the procurement organization.","At the beginning of the year, we asked Craig Rhoades to take the role of Chief Procurement Officer. Among the initiatives that Craig and his team have undertaken was to select a single integrated maintenance repair and operation supplier for all of AEP. This selection will allow AEP to take advantage of its buying power on behalf of its customers and allow us to reap significant back office and process savings.","Recognizing the competitive forces facing our business and the challenges posed by low capacity pricing in coming years, our employees have chosen to continue and expand the continuous improvement programs into 2014.","Specific, targeted and employee-generated continuous improvement is becoming part of our culture at AEP. We have come to realize that it works. It makes our operations more efficient, engages and energizes our employees and provides a mechanism for wringing unnecessary activities and costs out of our operations. Those savings can be channeled back into customer-focused operations and some can flow to the bottom line.","Nick mentioned some of the challenges posed by the capacity auction pricing in PJM. Expense savings through continuous improvement will help us fill the gap created by the reduced revenues, so low capital rotation into faster growth areas of our business like Transmission Operations. This is the same capital rotation that has allowed us to grow earnings in this segment of our operations from $0.02 per share in 2010 to a forecasted $0.14 per share this year.","It would be a leap of faith for you to believe that we could be successful in these endeavors if our recent track record did not demonstrate our employees' ability to successfully deliver these positive results. I would never bet against the dedication, ingenuity and hard work of the American Electric Power employee.","On Slide 12, I would like to point out some earnings contributors for the balance of 2013. Many of you have looked at the first half earnings of 2013, added last year's second half earnings and have expressed concerns about 2013 year end results. Those are concerns I don't share due to a number of the balance-of-year differences reflected on this slide. First, we are awaiting an order in Texas, as Nick indicated, placing the Turk power plant into rates. We anticipate an order shortly, with those rates to be effective to January 29 of this year.","Second, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a significant charge associated with refinancing of our parent company debt. That charge will not recur this year. In addition, we had some significant expenses in the third quarter last year associated with the derecho windstorm in the eastern part of our service territory. While we expect some continued storm activity, we do not anticipate a large storm of that magnitude. We believe that base utility O&M will be approximately flat to last year's level. We are anticipating better river conditions and grain export shipments this year on our River Operations business as compared to the dismal conditions from last year.","Finally, we expect decreased depreciation expenses associated with our recent write-off of the Muskingum River 5 unit in the second half of this year. Given where we are in the year and how we are tracking to our plan, we are confident of our ability to meet our operating earnings guidance range of $3.05 to $3.25 per share for 2013.","Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I hear your enthusiasm and optimism about the ongoing ability of the company to improve ROEs in states where you're under earning and control costs. But I -- there's still a lot of skepticism about the very significant headwind between 2015 and 2017 coming from the most recent PJM capacity result as it pertains to your ability to sustain your 4% to 6% growth rate. So can you just talk a little bit more about your planning horizon and what you think the tools are in your toolbox to plow through that headwind?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. Greg, I guess we sort of learned this early on in my tenure. We had a $250 million problem with Ohio. And now, this time around, we have 2.5 to 3 years to get this fully resolved from a sustainability fashion. But as I mentioned earlier on the O&M issues and the revenue enhancements that we have going on, we've -- it's crescendo-ing over time. And like -- the plant ideas were an example of that, where you have 6 to 8 plants going through it next year and then the rest of the plants going through the following year. And then we also have the buying measures, the differences in the way they operate the plants. Certainly, the unregulated plants are now looking at -- I mean, they can look across the board at areas of fuel. I mean, fuel is part of the business case for some of the things that they do, which typically is hard to do in a regulated environment because of the different capital versus fuel decisions. But also, Chuck is looking deeply at that team to figure out, okay, what the overhead costs look like. We have to address that because it's in a competitive environment. These plants are focused on making sure they survive. And they intend on doing that. So I think -- and really, I guess, the optimism is coming from the fact that our employees have already come together to find objectives in terms of savings and revenue enhancements for the year that -- or in excess of the targets that we had in place, and that's sort of confirming this year. But also, it's setting the track record for the future years because we're only getting partial benefits of some of these in '13. Some of these things are starting to kick in now and will kick in later in the year, and we'll get the full year benefits in '14. And then, with the additional ideas and things that we're doing, particularly lean wires, those types of activities will continue and we'll see those benefits going into those future years. So -- and I guess another issue with that is mid-2014, there will be another capacity auction for the future years, so that will give us some insight in terms of how we deal with it in that specific year of late '16 and early '17, which straddles 2 years. But as well, we have to decide, okay, how much of this is one-time adjustments where we can move around outages and those types of things versus how much is actually sustaining into the future? But it really goes to the question of the volatility of that business and what that means to our planning associated with that, but -- so we're not wasting any time, obviously. We're acting like we're going to have to have sustainable savings going forward that compensates for the capacity auction in late '16, early '17. But if it winds up being some -- the capacity market moving up in the future, then that can be a different thing. But I think we certainly are at a position now, though, to where we're confident that we are changing a culture that focuses on our ability to address these types of issues. We have to, and that's what we're paid to do. And it's something I think that our employees are certainly energized around to achieve. So as I've said earlier in the discussion I had, it probably -- I was thinking originally, well, we may be able to exceed 6% if we had more transmission spending and those types of things. Well, the more transmission spending we have our eye on is going to fortify that 4% to 6%, and that's -- so yes, I mean, it'd be silly for us to sit here and say, \"Well, it hasn't had any impact,\" because it has had an impact. But I think it's had an impact on our ability to exceed the 6% as opposed to be in that 4% to 6% range.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Listen, I'm going to maybe carry on with Greg's question. And I know you gave a very thorough answer. But I guess just maybe a little more simply, when you look at the Ohio generation and the uncertainty that RPM has created around economic viability and visibility to the business, how are you guys seeing that fit within AEP? And was RPM kind of a point where you were pushed to make a more drastic decision than maybe you were hoping?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. I think, certainly, if capacity prices had stayed in there at a reasonable level, it probably wouldn't have had everyone questioning the 4% to 6% or the -- or our ability to get the cost savings that we needed to make sure we were sustainable into the future. I think it raises a lot of questions, and we're addressing those questions. It's -- but it also puts us even more focused on how we adjust that particular business. And when we talk about minimum load adjustments, for example, I mean, the Amos plant reduced its minimum load by over 1,000 megawatts, which -- that's a big change. It takes a lot of cost out of the way we operate in relation to the market. Our people have a very -- I'm not going to say what it is. But certainly, they have a very aggressive measure on what they're trying to achieve in terms of a clearing price for capacity that they operate under. And that's -- but we have a lot of work to do, but -- and I can say that, that business, if it remains as volatile as it is, if we don't get this capacity construct working to where it should, where it respects the long-term investments made by steel in the ground investors in the territory, then that's not something we're very interested in. And so I -- it doesn't fit what we believe our investors are looking for, and we'll need to make adjustments.","Brian X. Tierney","Dan, I know you've talked about this in the past. We were very aggressive in moving our Muskingum River 5 as we saw the results of this and recognized that the capacity environment didn't lend itself to invest -- further investment in that unit. And we're going to be very disciplined in terms of the capital that we put to work in that regard. And right now, that's not an area that's attracting a lot of capital from us as compared to lower-volatility, higher-growth areas like our transmission business. We're -- we've been disciplined in the past, and we're going to demonstrate that discipline as we work our way through this capacity pricing issue.","Nicholas K. Akins","And I don't know that the generation function itself can make up that difference. I mean, if you're thinking about what energy prices can be in the future -- well, we don't want to bank on what energy prices are going to be in the future. We just assume they're going to be low. So we have to adjust accordingly. And it's not just a matter of looking at the generation -- the unregulated generation business itself. It's also a matter of looking at the overhead that's charged to that generation business because if there's less units running, if they're running in different ways and you're compartmentalizing the profit-loss picture of each unit, then it drives a very different supporting structure from corporate that supports it. So there's a lot of work to be done, and we'll be doing it.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Nick, I guess one other question is kind of looking at the load trends and, obviously, the bankruptcies to just kind of skew the industrial numbers maybe a little worse than they otherwise would be. But usage trends haven't been great. You've seen unemployment fall. You've seen economic growth in the region. What is the prognosis, do you think, for power demand growth for your territories going forward? And is there something bigger structural happening from usage that's really going to limit the amount of future demand growth?","Nicholas K. Akins","I think we continue to see probably soft load because -- and it's probably 2 things. I mean, energy efficiency is part of it. Also, it's an area where the economy -- and through the entire country, but certainly in our area as well, there's been a lasting impact of that. And at the first of the year, economists were saying by the third quarter, things would pick up. We were always saying and have been saying for several quarters now, actually since the third quarter of last year, the industrials were tenuous at best. And that continues to be the case. I think there are some structural changes that are occurring. We'll continue to have energy efficiency in play. The question is, can the electrification of the economy outstrip the energy efficiency piece of the business that enables us to continue to grow. But you can't bank on that. And that's why I say our business is going to be more about optimization and providing services to customers as well that provide additional benefits beyond what you see just strictly in the load numbers. But I also believe that, and as Brian pointed out, the oil and gas activity in our footprint is prevalent, whether the Eagle Ford Shale or the Utica Shale and others. Those are wet gas, and we have a lot of dry gas top formations. If we can -- if we ever get to a point where the economy starts to pick up like the economists keep projecting, at some point, we'll benefit probably more than others because of that indigenous growth associated with the shale gas footprint and the production capability associated with it, so -- and that's actually been our saving grace on the other primary metals industrial losses that have occurred. So I'd say, certainly, with the growing economy but also with the intensive focus on energy-related infrastructure, particularly in our service territory, that could be a benefit, so I -- and I'm probably more optimistic. I guess I'm probably -- if there's -- if it's pessimism, it's when is it going to happen. And we've all been waiting for an economic recovery, and you hear a lot about housing construction and I see a lot of commercial and housing construction in our service territory. And I also see the top of the -- all the corn in the fields are still green. So that's a good sign. But we really do need an emphasis placed on how to move this economy forward.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Hopefully, 2 quick questions. One is, it seems everyone's focused on the '16 and beyond. Just wanted -- how could you help us maybe forecast like transmission earnings? I mean, you guys have a great trajectory of transmission earnings, I think roughly $0.35 you're projecting in '15. I mean, what's the best way we could do to forecast that going forward? And the second question is kind of, you mentioned during your opening remarks with RPM and it just seems like it's all over the map. It's just kind of throwing numbers out of a hat. What does AEP think the reserve margin is with actually steel in the ground versus when you're adding in all these demand response and everything else?","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. So I guess it's what steel you put in the ground that's important. We've already finished our build cycle-related generations. So Turk went operational. We bought natural gas. That's all done in our Eastern footprint. And so we're at a point where we can decide for the -- probably for the first time in a long time where our capital was deployed. Much of it was driven by environmental spend. It was driven by new generation spend. Now it's driven by block and tackle infrastructure spending that typically commissions don't have an issue with. Matter of fact, they support it. And they should because we are at a stage where there's a rehabilitation of the grid that needs to occur. What we're trying to focus on is whether those no-regrets types of activities and optimization of transmission is no regrets. Infrastructure build-related distribution is no regrets. Certainly, the investment we're making from an environmental standpoint, we have about $4 billion to $5 billion left to spend associated with the particular plants that we have. But we're doing it in very different way. We're not going out and building and then asking for recovery of it. We're going in at the beginning and saying, \"Okay, before we start construction on this thing in a big way, we need to know, are we going to be able to recover it?\" And in the case of Kentucky, we haven't. In the case of Arkansas, we have, because there's a different set of circumstances and we're more than willing to do that. Matter of fact, we want to move more of our capital to those infrastructure areas. And that's the kind of steel in the ground that makes sense. With demand-side resources, certainly, I'm all for demand-side resources, but not to the point of really jeopardizing the reliability of the grid by depending on those kinds of resources for only a specific set of hours during the year, as opposed to the things that we run into in the real world from an operational perspective. I started out as an electric system dispatcher, and my experience is actually in interconnected power system operations. And I can tell you, what's going on now is wrong and it needs to be fixed. But that said, demand-side resources, certainly, generation with firm transmission coming into the area is a benefit. And we should be mindful of that because we're optimizing resources and we're actually defining a new set of resources that includes new technologies as well. So my view is, we stay with optionality around resource side of things, but we focus on those enabling areas where we can accommodate those resources and provide better services to our customers.","Brian X. Tierney","Anthony, we hope to have some more detail for you on the growth trajectory of transmission about the EEI conference timeframe. We're working on that capital rotation now. And one thing that we've never done is showed you earnings that we hope to get or think we might get or projects that may come together. We've really tried to show projects that are either approved or don't need further approval. And that's why we're reluctant to go out too far in terms of the transmission growth rate beyond areas where we've been through the planning process at the RTOs.","Nicholas K. Akins","And Anthony, I mean, I'll add on to that. We're already looking at additional transmission that can be -- I think like projects that can be put in place and addressed more quickly because, frankly, that's part of the revenue stream and the additional earnings that would partially fill the gap for this capacity issue that we had. So we have every motivation to continue with our transmission investment and every motivation to find and release every bit of capital. And the one thing that gets forgotten in all of this, the performance management side of things also produces capital alleviation benefits that can be -- they can be redeployed to other areas, including transmission. So we're not just about O&M changes, we're about capital changes as well to accommodate that and fuel that future growth. So as Brian said, at EEI, we'll have more information on that.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just quick one on -- so on the -- just the quarterly sales in commercial, you mentioned, Brian, I think, that you were strong still in Texas and Ohio, but you didn't really say very much about what had underpinned the big drop. Was it a couple of specific items or something more broad? Can you just give us a bit more color on what certainly turns the negative there?","Brian X. Tierney","Sure. It was -- and it was largely broader-based across the area. The place where we saw -- places where we saw the increase was really associated with shale gas plays, where we're seeing the growth in employment. And in the other areas, we just weren't seeing that growth in employment as much as we were. And it was pretty much broad-based across the sector. The one thing, Jonathan, that I'll say, and we look at these monthly. We look at -- we discuss with you quarterly weather-normalized sales. You really need to look at, I think, the trend over time to try and understand what's happening with load and can't just take it quarter-to-quarter. Up modestly in the first quarter of this year, down greater than 2% in the second quarter. You need to kind of look at a trend line for these quarterlies to get some sense for what you think is going on. But with the exception of Texas and Ohio, the decrease was pretty broadly based.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And secondly, on the -- just to understand this interest income item. So there was like $0.06 of benefit relating to reversing a previous negative related to the U.K. windfall tax. Is that correct?","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. So it's separated into 2 categories: one is the interest income component of it, and the other is the tax component of it. Interest income, we always reflect in ongoing earnings. To the point where it's specifically associated with this item, we had a negative in the fourth quarter of last year, as we thought that the case was going against us. And then the PP&L won their case at the U.S. Supreme Court. And since we had previously adjusted for this in operating earnings, the interest income component were just reflecting the same treatment that we always had for interest income.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's -- the negative, it was the -- the negative was booked Q4 last year. This reverses that, effectively?","Brian X. Tierney","It doesn't entirely reverse it. We took a partial write-down of that in the fourth quarter of last year, where we had previously accounted for the interest income, and then we had the full reversal in this year. But the full treatment of this issue has always been in ongoing earnings.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Is there any ongoing -- beyond this quarter, do we have any continued impact from this item?","Brian X. Tierney","Very little bit.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so -- and how -- just in Q3 or is that...","Brian X. Tierney","It will be true-ups as we work our way through the balance of the year, but very little.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then could I just squeeze in one other thing? On the whole -- this conversation going on with the commission and Ormet around trying to reduce tariff, does -- how does -- how should we -- is there any kind of guidance exposure to that? Or how should we be thinking about that as we watch it play out?","Brian X. Tierney","We -- so I wouldn't want to talk specifically about the discussions with the commission that we're having. There are issues related to whether or not Ormet stays in business or not altogether. And those items are fairly small for us. If Ormet were to stop operations altogether, the pretax would be about $2.8 million per month, so for the balance of the year, maybe $0.025, and for all of 2014, maybe $0.045 per share.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That would be the -- that would be not -- but the incremental would be the difference?","Brian X. Tierney","That would be if they -- that's right. And that would be if they ceased operations altogether. But remember, Jonathan, there will be some offset for that as well in off-system sales as we've had the incremental energy to take out to the market.","Nicholas K. Akins","Yes. It's a large load, like many of these industrials, but that one in particular. And if you -- we don't hardly make any money off of it to begin with. But then, if it did go away, then we'd be selling it at any off-system [ph] market, so...","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just on the PJM outcome and implications, does it have any change besides Muskingum 5 to your kind of coal plant shutdown plans or EPA spend? Are those under any kind of review because of that?","Nicholas K. Akins","I'd say no, not at this point, obviously. We've addressed Muskingum River 5. That was the one issue where we had an incremental investment that would have to be made and was related to natural gas, so -- and if the market didn't support making that investment, then we retire it. The others are either planned to be retired anyway, which we've already written those off in terms of an impairment. So the others are fully controlled units that operate well in the market and -- but we're certainly focused on that year to ensure that we're driving costs out and efficiencies that we can drive through the market and make sure they continue to operate. So we don't see anything else at this point.","Brian X. Tierney","Yes. So Steve, we've been proactive in getting out in front of this. As Nick mentioned, we had those units that we knew we were going to retire in 2015, and the Ohio components of them we wrote off late last year. And then we had bubble units, and Muskingum River 5 is one where we thought we were going to be able to retrofit it and run it on gas through 2028, and the capacity results just made that not a prudent investment for us. So it went from being on the bubble to being a unit that makes sense for us to not operate after 2015.","Julie Sherwood","Thank you for joining us on today's call.

Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Akins","Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today at our second quarter 2014 earnings call. I am once again pleased to report a very positive quarter for AEP driven by strong regulated company results with a continued emphasis on the transmission business as well as our regulated utilities. Additionally, our unregulated generation, retail and river operations divisions performed well for the quarter.","So, the headlines for the quarter very positive. AEP delivered GAAP and operating earnings of $0.80 per share compared with $0.69 per share GAAP and $0.73 per share operating earnings for the second quarter \u201913.","Year-to-date 2014 GAAP and operating earnings have now resulted in $1.95 per share compared with $1.44 GAAP and $1.53 operating for the same period in 2013. We are reaffirming our earlier adjusted guidance range for the year of $3.35 to $3.55 per share and remain committed to our 4% to 6% growth trajectory based on our original 2013 guidance range.","AEP is allocating another $100 million of incremental capital in 2014 to our transmission business. As you may recall, we previously allocated $200 million of incremental capital of transmission in the first quarter so we are executing on our plan of advancing the transmission business model.","Additionally ETT has been rated BAA1 by Moody\u2019s and is now paying a dividend to its owners so good news from the Western front.","Growth in our service territory continues for the quarter with weather normalized load increasing 2.3% overall for the year so far excluding the effects of Ormet, the industrial load that went bankrupt last year.","In fact, once again excluding Ormet during the second quarter, the industrial load was up a healthy 4.5% and 3.4% year-to-date drilling by the shale gas, petrochemicals and all industrial sectors with the exception of mining.","Commercial and residential loads continue to be up for the year as well. Brian will cover the load growth in more detail later but we\u2019re pleased with the energy transition that is occurring in our territory and what that means for load growth for the future.","Cost containment activities resulting from culture and LEAN processes continue on target and we remain committed to reinforcing these activities throughout our companies. We\u2019ll have more to talk about on that issue later on.","So, the fundamentals of operational excellence, capital and OEM discipline and open and collaborative culture that defines our ability to meet, challenges. And finally the focus on execution of our business plan in support of infrastructure development and the customer experience is intact at AEP and once again exemplified by second quarter performance.","But we still have much work to do as we redefine in AEP that delivers consistent quality earnings and dividend growth while meeting the challenges of the future. So, let me add a little context to some of the areas that you might find adventurous.","On the regulatory front, APCo, in West Virginia, filed a base rate case on June 30, requesting a rate increase of $226 million of which $45 million is a vegetation rider.","Our earned ROE in the West Virginia jurisdiction of APCo was 5.8% as filed with our current approved range of 10% to 10.9%, so an increase here is definitely warranted. We don\u2019t have a finalized procedure schedule for the case but we expected to conclude by April of next year.","Also PSO filed a non-unanimous settlement with AARP as the only outlier. It essentially keeps present rates in place with an addition of AMI rider that increases revenues by over $7 million in 2014 increasing to over $27 million in 2016. So we are pleased with the parties to continue to recognize the value of infrastructure development to improve the customer experience.","Before discussing our initial thoughts on the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, let me switch you over to the next page of the presentation material to my favorite equalizer chart. Overall, from last quarter, the regulated operations ROE has moved up to 10.1% from 9.9% last quarter. So, let\u2019s start moving across the page.","Starting out with 8, Ohio Power, their ROI is about 14% now but we expect by year end their ROE should come down to around the 12% range. For APCo, the combined companies certainly masked the disparity between Virginia and West Virginia ROEs. Virginia is in pretty good shape. Its ROE is around 10.8% which is within the earnings band of 10.4% to 11.4%.","As you know we\u2019re working on West Virginia with the rate case so that will be filed and certainly we expect to make progress there.","From a conductive power standpoint, Kentucky is still as we mentioned in previous quarters, there already is low due to the transfer of the Mitchell Plant. So, while their earnings are up, the equity balance is significantly up. So, it draws the ROE down.","We\u2019ll follow rate case at the end of 2014 that would reflect the full recovery of Mitchell and expect this case to be effective in July 2015.","In the meantime, there could be increases in ROE given there is a mechanism that also some sales would inure to the benefit of Kentucky Power if you reached certain threshold. So, that should come up a little bit.","I&M, with rate cases completed in early 2013 and strong plant performance adding to offset some sales. I&M is currently earning in ROE slightly higher than authorized at 10.8%. Their authorized ROE is 10.2% so not too far out of line there.","And they certainly have made a lot of progress in that regard. It\u2019s noteworthy that they filed for the additional five solar facilities totaling 16 megawatts as well. So really lot of positive things occurring over in the I&M jurisdictions.","PSO, as I mentioned earlier with the rate case, the reduced ROE is really actually occurring from the O&M that\u2019s been moved for generation expenses during the quarter. So, that advancement of O&M is $60 million, some of them went to PSO and that\u2019s what\u2019s pulling their ROE down somewhat, so we expect that to improve as well.","For SWEPCo, it continues to be a lower ROE given that we still have yet to get the disposition of the Arkansas portion of the third plant taken care of. There is work in progress to try to address that situation. In the meantime, there will be several initiatives they\u2019re underway and including a Texas filing to recover transmission cost and then LEAN programs to lower cost and generation distribution.","But as we go forward we\u2019ll be certainly looking after the election in Arkansas to really push forward with the activities around the Arkansas portion of Turk.","AEP Texas has favorable ROEs, primarily because of the impact of securitization but they\u2019re also doing well from a distribution perspective as well.","AEP Transco continues to improve. You\u2019ll probably see a pretty sizeable jump there from 9.7% last quarter up to 11.4%. As we told you last quarter, their ROE would increase particularly in line with the true-ups adjustments that occurred that were just now booked as a result of \u201913 adjustment so, very good progress in the transmission area.","So that pretty well wraps it up for the equalizer chart and certainly we\u2019re making a lot of progress in that regard. We know what the areas are that we\u2019re working on. So you can expect continued improvement in that area.","As I said earlier, our LEAN activities are progressing very well. We\u2019re not letting up on the progress here because this part of our cultural transformation redefining how we do business in the future.","So, Brian will be reviewing the details around the LEAN activities in moment. But I did want to point out some of the examples of what we were seeing from areas such as generation and distribution.","At Cardinal Plant, they bought a truck to load all the welding materials in one place what that was mobile so that they wouldn\u2019t have to go back and forth to get inventory for parts. And that significantly saves time in terms of addressing tube leaks and other areas to get generation back more quickly.","The South Ben storage yard, de-cluttering an organization of storerooms and toolkits of it, work times can be improved. The engineering group created new documents to enable faster response at times for projects to our customers so that certainly improve the customer experience.","Cook Nuclear is going through LEAN activities and one of the first in the country to go through that type of activity. And we\u2019re significantly already have a reduced targeted refueling outage duration and the costs associated with it. So, there is a multitude of process reviews to eliminate redundant activities and those that don\u2019t add value.","So, obviously we\u2019re very careful with that \u2013 with the nuclear side. But certainly it\u2019s something that we should do so that we can work smarter at the Cook Nuclear station.","And just to give you an idea of the range of the things that our employees are coming up with, at Amos Plant, they reviewed the plant\u2019s barge unloading system that led to $6 million investment to be made but it reduces coal costs by $10 million per year, very positive.","And then smaller change, but I think no less important is in APCo Charleston area, an employee notice that we were discarding flagging vests. And we started to decide to wash them instead and save $6,000 per year. And I know that sounds small but that\u2019s one employee coming up for the $6,000 per year and with our 20,000 employees, that\u2019s $120 million.","So, if those kinds of things that we\u2019ll have to work indigenously within our organization at levels throughout the organization to ensure that we continue to get the benefits of the LEAN activities and the efficiency changes that we\u2019re making. So I\u2019m very proud of what our employees at the front line are accomplishing in their LEAN activities.","Lastly, I want to AEP\u2019s thoughts on the EPA Clean Power Plant. From the outset, I want to reiterate AEP\u2019s commitment towards achieving a balanced portfolio of resources that provides clean, affordable and reliable power for our customers.","While much progress has already been made towards reductions in all emission categories, including carbon dioxide and while further progress is certainly being made, rational timing and targets are absolutely critical in achieving the substantial reductions in CO2 emissions contemplated by the EPA plant.","As Administrator McCarthy has mentioned on several occasions and I want to reiterate here, is that this far reaching plant is a proposed rule and is yet to be finalized. So, as we look at the proposed rule, the current plan is much too aggressive in many states. And in fact, it\u2019s a multi-variable equation that doesn\u2019t solve within the timeframe given.","To force a change in resource mix, system dispatch and market conditions, along with navigating a myriad of state related review process is covering many issues, while not impacting reliability in such a short timeframe could result basically in a convoluted mess that turns the foundation, assumption, and building blocks of the plan in the pipe drains.","The idea of natural gas generation to run at 70% capacity factor, we needed the plant\u2019s natural gas pipeline system or the electric system is in place to support, it is not credible. Or to expect 6% efficiency gains on coal units to occur, when only about 1% is viable even if capacity factors remained high, which will \u2013 which won\u2019t happen because we have a forced dispatch of weather resources ahead of low-cost coal and that\u2019s just not credible either.","Moreover to expect energy efficiency overall to improve 1.5% per year, when EPRI itself, the Electric Power Research Institute, has determined it only 0.5% to 0.6% can be achieved annually, certainly goes beyond aspirational thinking. As the CEO, I\u2019m all about aspirational visions but this must be grounded reality.","These are state plans, not AEP plans or other market participant plans, so we must be able to have time to work with the multitude of different stakeholders including the state, and the EPA to determine a course and be able to execute on the myriad of different processes and approvals to make this transformation occur.","AEP is committed to working with the EPA just as we did during the Mercury Rule comment period which is far from over by the way given 2015 pending retirements of coal fire generation have yet to occur.","AEP was right about the analysis of the Mercury Rules and we will continue to be factual and collaborative during the upcoming comment process.","As an aside, speaking of the units retiring in 2015, 80% of them were called upon and ran during the second quarter, a quarter that was essentially no extreme weather conditions. And certainly there were outages being taken, generation has to take maintenances outages during that part of the year. But it\u2019s incredible that 80% recalled upon just a year in advance of their retirement.","Briefly in regards to the unregulated generation, if I can talk a little bit about that, we continue to review with the board the options available to us regarding the future of that business. And we continue to reinforce the value of the unregulated generation through market reforms, hedging of our generation through our retail and wholesale businesses and advanced regulatory initiatives such as development of purchase power arrangements.","This PPA initiative not only supports Ohio generation but provides a value hedge to customers against volatile market conditions. Any decisions with regard to the unregulated generation business will be made on a timely basis to maximize shareholder value.","Speaking of shareholder value, every capital decision we make is based upon our ability to move capital to infrastructure developments particularly transmission and the regulated operations.","For those of you thinking about M&A, the way we look at it, because we have about $2 billion of incremental transmission projects over the next four years looking for capital, we made \u201c$200 million acquisition\u201d in the first quarter, $100 acquisition this quarter at a good return with virtually no delay, no premium and accretive to shareholders. That\u2019s our standard for investment.","So, in a nutshell, we have had another great quarter centered on the fundamentals we laid out for our investors over two years ago, you can expect us to stick with their plans to be a regulated utility to drive effective capital and OEM discipline, and continually adjust to the challenges ahead. Thanks.","And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Brian. Brian?","Brian Tierney","Thank you, Nick. And good morning everyone. On slide 5, you will see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 by segment for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods.","I plan on focusing your attention this morning mostly on the second quarter results. For those of you who are interested in the year-to-date comparison, you\u2019ll find that in the appendix. I will say that the drivers we discussed at length during the first quarter earnings call remain the drivers for the year-to-date results.","For the company overall, operating earnings for the second quarter, was $390 million or $0.80 per share compared to $0.73 per share or $357 million recorded last year. These results when combined with the first quarter, pushed first half 2014 earnings to $950 million or $1.95 per share compared to $1.53 per share or $744 million earned in the first half 2013.","Looking at the slide, you can see that each business segment is either equal to or above results recorded in 2013. With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on slide 6.","Second quarter earnings for the vertically integrated utility segment were $0.31 per share this year comparable to the results of last year. Rate changes across many of our jurisdictions added $0.06 per share for the quarter. The increase in rates is a result of incremental investment made to serve our customers.","Higher wholesale power prices and the availability of our generating fleet bolstered off system sales which benefited both customers and shareholders resulting in improved earnings in the second of $0.03 per share.","Normalized retail margins contributed $0.01 per share to the year-over-year growth. Weather for the quarter was comparable to last year.","The quarterly increase in margins was offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and other items. The increase in O&M adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.07 due to higher generation maintenance cost, an increase in transmission service expense and higher employee related cost, partially offset by lower storm expense this year.","The higher depreciation expense resulted from increased investment and plant, reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.18 per share for the quarter, $0.03 higher than last year.","Rate changes added $0.01 per share for the quarter and transmission revenues were higher due to customers who have switched suppliers in Ohio as well as the effect of increased investment. These favorable items were partially offset by higher O&M expense due to higher transmission, distribution and employee related costs.","The transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.10 per share, a $0.06 improvement reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. From June of last year to June of this year, this segment\u2019s plan grew by nearly $1 billion, 92% increase.","The generation and marketing segments earnings of $0.20 per share adds $0.02 to our quarterly comparison. This segment benefited from higher wholesale power prices and lower interest expense resulting from a very low weighted average cost of debt for generation resources.","AEP River operations contributed $0.01 per share to earnings, $0.03 higher than our 2013 results due to improvements in demand for barge freight.","Finally, corporate and other results were off $0.07 per share, primarily due to the interest income benefit recorded last year from the resolution of the U.K. Windfall tax item.","In summary, our earnings performance during the quarter remained strong, largely due to a combined favorable $0.09 per share from our regulated segments. In addition the competitive segments also contributed to the year-over-year growth in earnings.","These results along with a strong performance in the first quarter, allowed us to advance spending into 2014 from future years as we announced in April. This leaves us well positioned within the guidance range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share.","Let\u2019s take a look at slide 7, where we can review normalized load trends for the quarter. As I made comments about industrial and total load on this slide, my remarks will adjust for the impact of the Ormet load. You will remember that Ormet, our largest customer at that time, ceased operations in the fourth quarter of 2013.","The convention for adjusting for Ormet has meant to give a sense of how our industrial and total load are recovering in more of a going forward basis, since Ormet is not expected to return to production. In the charts, the numbers are presented with and without the affects of Ormet.","Before we dig into the quarterly numbers, let me make some comments on year-to-date normalized loads. Every one of our operating companies experienced total normalized load increases year-to-date. The increases range from six tenths of a percent and at Appalachian and Wheeling Power to an impressive 4.6% at AEP Texas.","In addition four of our seven operating companies experienced growth in all three retail classes.","Turning to the quarterly comparisons, on the bottom right of the slide, you can see that overall weather normalized load was up 1.3%. This is being driven by industrial load which is up remarkable 4.5%. This marks the third consecutive quarter with positive growth in industrial sales.","The company experienced growth in seven of our top 10 industrial sectors for the quarter, and nine of the top 10 for the year. The lone exception is coal mining which was down 3.5%. The quarterly sector leaders are pipeline transportation up 30.4%, chemical manufacturing our second largest sector up 11.1% and oil and gas extraction up 10.5%. We will talk more about the impacts of shale gas developments later.","On the upper right of the slide, you will see that commercial sales were up four tenths of a percent for the quarter and have experienced positive growth for the last four quarters. We now believe that we\u2019re on track to match a positive annual comparison for the year, for the first time since 2008.","Four of our top five commercial sectors have experienced year-to-date sales increases, the only exception being the retail trade sector which was down nearly 1%.","On the upper left of the slide you will see that residential sales were down 1.5% for the quarter. While residential results varied by quarter, they are up year-to-date and are expected to be positive for the year.","Turning to slide 8, let\u2019s review recent economic data for AEP service territory. Looking at estimated GDP for the quarter, growth for AEP at 3% continues to outperform that of the U.S. at 2.5%. On the upper right of the slide, you can see that economic growth in our Western footprint continues to outpace the U.S. and our Eastern service area which trails U.S. growth by 0.5%.","In the bottom left quadrant, you will see the positive job growth in AEP service area, trials that of the U.S. as a whole by four tenths of a percent. Similar to GDP growth, job growth and AEP\u2019s Western territories, outpaces both the U.S. and AEP\u2019s Eastern service areas.","For AEP, we have experienced strong employment gains in the natural resources and mining, leisure and hospitality, construction and manufacturing sectors.","With that segue, let\u2019s turn to slide 9, to see how big of an impact the U.S. shale gas developments is to AEP\u2019s industrial growth. In the first quarter of 2014, we thought that it was notable that industrial sales and AEP shale counties grew by 30% versus non-shale counties which had decreases of 1.7%.","For the second quarter, that contrast becomes even more pronounced as industrial sales in our shale counties increased by a dramatic 39% over last year\u2019s second quarter. And our non-shale counties on industrial sales decreased of 1.6%.","This shale county, surge in industrial sales are significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale gas counties.","The bottom chart segments, industrial sales growth by major shale regions. As you can see in our Eastern footprint industrial sales are growing fastest in the Utica, Marcellus regions and our Western footprint we are fastest in the Permian and Woodford regions, while sales are down in the Eagle Ford region.","Looking forward, we are anticipating significant oil and gas related load increases in our shale footprint. We have recently updated our share related load forecast and the incremental capacity requirements through the end of the decade have increased by over 20%.","In Ohio, the Department of Natural Resources has just announced that from 2012 to 2013, oil production in the state increased 62% and natural gas production increased 97%. In addition, the ODNR noted that general drilling permits issued in the state were 583 in 2013 and are expected to grow to 700 this year and to 800 in 2015.","Turning to slide 10, let\u2019s review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total capital remains unchanged relative to last quarter at 54.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt have improved modestly from last quarter and remains solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at five times and 20.3% respectively.","Our qualified pension is now fully funded at 100%. This is great news for our customers, employees, retirees and investors and reflects significant investment in and de-risking of the plan over the last five years. This is noteworthy given that our pension funding stood at 73% at the end of 2008 and was only 82% funded at the end of 2010.","The weighted average during of the assets now more closely matches that of the liabilities at about 10.2 years. And at 100% funding, our targeted allocation of fixed income assets rises to 60% from its current allocation of 55%.","We plan to make contributions to the plan at roughly the estimated annual service cost of about $75 million.","Finally, our liquidity stands at about $2.9 billion, and are supported by a two revolving credit facilities that extended into the summers of 2016 and 2017.","We have worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on this slide, and believe that we are well positioned for the future.","Turning to slide 11, let\u2019s see if I can wrap this thing up. The company is off to a strong first half of 2014. For the quarter, all of our business segments were equal to or greater than last year\u2019s results. And for the year-to-date, all of our business segments exceeded last year\u2019s numbers.","On top of those results, we are executing on our commitments. We previously stated that we were going to accelerate transmission investment when possible, expand our LEAN and continuous improvement initiatives and shift cost out of 2016 and into 2014 where it makes sense.","I\u2019ll spend a few moments giving an update on the progress we\u2019ve made on those commitments. First, starting with the goal of accelerating transmission investment. In addition to the $200 million increase that we announced after the first quarter, our year-to-date results give us the confidence and the cash to advance another $100 million into 2014.","This increased investment will fund NERC-mandated projects, reliability projects related to generation retirements and new customer connections. This will bring our forecasted 2014 transmission capital spend to a total $1.9 billion. In regards to the continuous improvement efforts, employees have now completed lean initiatives at seven of our generating plants with plans to complete an additional five during 2014.","Our DC Cook Nuclear Plant also started deploying LEAN earlier this year. Seven of our 32 distribution districts have completed their initiatives with six starting in July and scheduled to be completed this year.","The first of five regions in transmission field operations started LEAN in this month. In addition, numerous corporate groups such as IT, supply-chain, procurement and fleet and commercial operations are applying LEAN principles and practices. In places where employees have engaged in LEAN initiatives, we have identified cost savings through more efficient work practices and better utilization of the contractor workforce.","Finally, in regards to the cost-shifting initiatives, we have accelerated approximately $60 million of expenses from 2016 into 2014. This means that our customers would get the benefit of those activities sooner than initially planned and that means that the company can produce \u2013 can prudently manage with some of the benefits of the strong 2014 earnings have allowed.","Most of these costs are being shifted in the second half of 2014, and include activities related to plant outages and other customer focused activity. It is fair to conclude that the company is making progress on its commitments in these areas.","Finally, we are reaffirming our 2014 operating earnings guidance range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. We are pleased with our earnings performance for the first half of the year, mindful of a mild start to the summer and confident in our ability to perform within the range.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from the line of Hugh Wynne, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Good morning.","Nick Akins","How are you?","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Very well. Congratulations on a strong quarter.","Nick Akins","Thanks.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments on the new proposed regulation on CO2. And I was wondering if I could maybe draw you out a little bit on how you see the rule being implemented in the states where you have generation? I appreciate that you\u2019re submitting comments and that the rule will be changed, but are you anticipating any particular form of regulation in the major states where you have coal-fired power plants?","Brian Tierney","Yes, so, that\u2019s a great question. And I don\u2019t know if I have a good answer at this point. I\u2019m not sure anybody does. We\u2019re working extensively and have outreach to all of our states, trying to understand exactly what this plan means. And even our generation, we\u2019re just a part of each state that we serve. And that\u2019s what I stress, these are state plans.","So, we\u2019re going through the process with them of understanding the generation is out there, the commitments made around the generation. What that means to the overall plan for the state in response. And some of our states obviously have taken a very aggressive in terms of litigation. And it remains to be seen how that whole process will work out.","I think this plan is more far reaching than anything that\u2019s ever occurred before. And when you change dispatch order of units within states, when you change resources within states and give guidelines that are fully significant, that really minimizes the other options available, it really makes it challenging for the states. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to work through the process to fully understand.","We\u2019ll get back with EPA on the facts that we see from a state by state perspective and have discussions about it and specific examples of areas that are of concern. And we\u2019ll have to work it out.","But I really can\u2019t tell you what the process is at this point. As you know the rule provides for 2017 and then 2018 if the states decide to get together which then would be interesting in itself. And as one participant in part of that overall plan, it\u2019s hard to imagine how these things are all going to come together in that timeframe. And then many of the requirements really hit in 2020. So you really don\u2019t have much time, probably not enough time to get what you need done.","So, this thing has a wrong way to play out. I think certainly the comments that the EPA are critical and certainly the EPA needs to be cognizant that these states are dealing with very, very detailed, very complicated issues and also the companies involved. So, Hugh, that\u2019s a long answer \u2013 long way of saying we don\u2019t know at this point.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I appreciate your time on that. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi guys, congrats on a good quarter and also want to thank you. I know you implemented at the beginning of the year, but for the new disclosure methodology, it makes understanding AEP a little bit easier to do.","Nick Akins","Brian\u2019s happy about that comment.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","One question on the transmission side, you did those in the first quarter and now you\u2019re doing it again in terms of updating your transmission capital spending guidance for the year. Can you give us a little more insight on where that spending is occurring, meaning either specific jurisdictions, specific Transco, or even whether it\u2019s just embedded within the VIU, T&I, or is it actually at the Transco sub? Just trying to tie together your CapEx versus your segments.","Nick Akins","Yes, it\u2019s occurring all over the place. But primarily in Ohio, Oklahoma and Indiana, and there are RTO mandated projects, there are other projects, reliability projects, customer connect projects. And about \u2013 is our call about 75% of the mix was in the Transco\u2019s and 25% was in the regulated operated companies.","So, this is all block and tackle, mandate and spending and we have a list of projects and it\u2019s not block. We\u2019re just allocating another $100 million that the transmission say go find something.","We have a list of what exactly those projects are by individual project. And I know Brian\u2019s like 20 to 25 separate projects on the page that certainly show the detail.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes. Does this mean that you\u2019re moving stuff that you had planned on doing in \u201915, \u201916 and \u201917 into 2014? So maybe \u201914 CapEx, you\u2019re kind of accelerating the earnings power, but you\u2019re not necessarily making, I don\u2019t know, for year five earnings power higher? Or is this an increase in capital spending if you think about three to five year budget?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, it is obviously first of all taking care of that green section of the graph that, the incremental transmission that we had for the year. And then we also advanced some projects from future years into this year. But that doesn\u2019t meant that all those, there is no additional identified projects along the way. There is a lot of other activity going on.","The green sections were only defined projects that we knew exactly what they were and where they would be done. And then, of course the work continues on continued rehabilitation of the grid from a transmission perspective and additional projects.","So, while it\u2019s advanced from future years, that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t incremental projects as well.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and last item. Great. Brian, this may be more of a detailed one, on the O&M change for 2014 you\u2019ve talked about, can you reiterate what\u2019s the amount? You said that it\u2019s largely going to be second half of 2014. In which parts of the business is that actually impacting, meaning VIU, T&I, elsewhere?","Nick Akins","It\u2019s going to impact all of them Michael. It\u2019s about $60 million and it\u2019s going to impact the vertical integrated utilities and APGR in terms of planned outages. And it\u2019s going to impact all of them in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s going to impact vertically integrated utilities and transmission distribution utilities in terms of some transmission forestry spend that we\u2019re going to do.","And then there are other customer related projects that will be in all other segments that we deal with where we\u2019ll be trying to pull those costs forward.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So its costs that you will pull forward into 2014, but therefore wouldn\u2019t necessarily have recurring in 2015?","Nick Akins","Yes, it\u2019s really. We\u2019re trying to take those \u201916 cost out because we have that challenge associated with the capacity revenue fall-off in 2016. So, we\u2019re trying to take cost out of \u201916 and pull them into \u201914 and then not have those costs be recurring again in 2016. So, if it\u2019s plant outages, if we can get ahead on transmission tree trimming that we then get the benefits of that for our customers in 2014, but will have better resulting spend happening in 2016 to help us fill that gap.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated and congratulations on a good quarter.","Nick Akins","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning.","Nick Akins","Hi Dan, good morning.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Listen, I guess, just, Nick, going back to your comment on the Ohio generation, you said you\u2019ll address it in a timely fashion and enhance shareholder value. Can you give an update on progress you\u2019re seeing as far as long-term contracting of those assets as an alternative to keeping them? And then with the pullback in power prices and that sort of thing, is that having a bearing on potentially delaying when you guys would want to do something hoping for a better environment, particularly after AES pulled their project?","Nick Akins","Well, the way we look at it, the way we originally told you I guess last year or a year before. We\u2019re looking for certain things. And certainly the hedging of that generation is critical. Certainly from maybe retail and the wholesale side, we continue to work on the PPA issue in Ohio focused on trying to bring some sensibility around the risk that customers are taking on in Ohio.","And certainly the market areas that we\u2019ve been working on with PJM and others to enhance capacity and then with the energy markets themselves and improving on average. Those are all things that help us determine what the future of that business look like. And obviously we\u2019re not just stopping there we\u2019re looking at all the cost structures around that business. And really treating it like any other investor would treat it.","So, it\u2019s really important for us to reach those milestones to fully understand what the valuation of that business looks like in the future. And then, the one thing we have is time to focus on those activities and make a decision. All along the way, we\u2019re keeping our board up-to-date on what market conditions look like, what the areas look like in terms of the options available to us.","And that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, at that point is we will decide what to do with that business when we feel like the time is right to make sure we maximize shareholder value.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","So, that sounds like 2014 will be consumed with, or part of 2014 will be consumed with making a decision. But there\u2019s not actually anything getting done this year?","Brian Tierney","Yes, the 2014 obviously is a year where certain milestones have to come into place. I mean, we have several \u2013 we\u2019ve already gone through a capacity auction that was improved. We still have some changes that are permeating through PJM with the demand curve and so forth.","We\u2019ve got other things we\u2019re doing with it and we believe that in 2015 like I mentioned with 80% that capacity running, it\u2019s going to retire mid-\u201915. So, the very real impacts of the retirements that generation is going to be reflected through the capacity and energy markets.","So that will give us a real view of what that valuation looks like. And also, from a call standpoint, Chuck Zebula is doing everything he can do down to get the cost structure itself down. And with the LEAN activities, the plants are running very differently than what they ran in the past.","So, all those things are coming together. And 2014 is a year where we\u2019re going through the process, determining what the milestones are and what the options are available.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess, just one other question on kind of the load growth trends: obviously, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm in the first quarter. And trying to decipher between weather and usage was a question, and we saw residential taper off comparably in the second quarter. How are you feeling about the outlook for demand growth kind of beyond 2014 and are you as encouraged today as you might of been, say, at the end of the first quarter?","Nick Akins","I\u2019d say, we\u2019re just as encouraged because you look at residential for example, quarter by quarter I mean, it was pretty high change in first quarter and then it shows a slight decrease in second quarter.","A lot of times, residential sort of gets skewed from quarter to quarter based on whether it be holidays, whether it be areas where we\u2019re having to residential parties maybe dealing with their loads in different fashions and different parts of the year because you could have like last year there was that federal furlough that was done that people stayed home, residential went up. So this year, it sort of shows it goes down during this time last year.","So, if things like that that will make the residential sort of come in and out each quarter. I tend to look more at the averages of residential load. You don\u2019t see that so much with commercial and industrial loads. And with commercial, showing a consistently positive and then in particular the industrial continues to expand, expands more every quarter.","That\u2019s a good thing because we\u2019ve always said industrial leads commercial, commercial leads residential. So I think it\u2019s a good indicator for the future.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Just kind of on Dan\u2019s question, just on the Ohio generation, is an outcome in Ohio around the PPA a gating issue for your decision?","Nick Akins","I think certainly its part of the decision process. But I think the real reason why we\u2019re doing the PPA arrangement. Number one, is bring some stability to the generation in Ohio, the second reason obviously is our customers, all right, we\u2019re asking terms of the volatility of the market.","So, it\u2019s important for us to get some measure of that in place. It\u2019s just like you buy fuel or anything else or stock, you\u2019re in for the long-term, you\u2019re in for the short term. Long-term capacity and energy needs to be there in Ohio.","For the first time, Ohio is short and Ohio is going to be a purchaser on the market if it\u2019s not careful in reinforcing the value of this generation. So, yes, it\u2019s a big part of the decision process for us, because you make very different decisions about generation, unless you have long-term purchase power arrangements whether they\u2019re formula-based rate or within the retail side that we\u2019re talking about.","So, there is an opportunity there. And I think there is legitimate concern on the part of many including the industrials. And they should be concerned. And that\u2019s something I think that we\u2019re focused on answering that question during this year.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","And just switching gears, the cost shift from \u201816 to \u201814, should we think about that as allowing you to get to the 4% or 6% or bring you comfortably within that 4% to 6% growth 2015 to 2016?","Brian Tierney","I think all of the activities that we talked about doing, the LEAN initiatives, the cost shifting and the incremental transmission spend are meant to have us inside that range.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Tierney","There are a number of other factors that will impact where we land in that range. And they are the normal factors that you normally think about. Load growth, our ability to contain cost and wholesale energy pricing. And also keep in mind that what we\u2019ve done so far is what we\u2019ve been able to identify in the prospects of what\u2019s happened so far from LEAN activities and so forth.","So, as far as 2016 is concerned, we still have a lot more work to do. I mean, we obviously wouldn\u2019t have put our guidance for \u201816 if we didn\u2019t feel comfortable within that range. Where we\u2019re at within the range is, it will be a measure of how much work we can get done from this year, end of \u201815, end of \u201816.","And then obviously in November, we\u2019re going to give a view of what we see happening with additional guidance that we provide then.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Thank you very much.","Brian Tierney","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stephen Bryd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nick Akins","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. You gave some good color in the presentation on the growth of shale gas activity. Is the kind of growth that we\u2019re seeing, is this in line with your expectations? Is it accelerating above your expectations? Can you give a little more color on the degree of activity that you\u2019re seeing?","Nick Akins","I think in some cases it\u2019s above our expectations because and I know I heard the other day our President in AEP Texas said that we have in the last year put in like 20, 25 \u2013 about 25 substations in that territory, which means we\u2019re connecting a lot of load.","And we\u2019re doing in terms of transmission, the substation in a box we call it but the skid stations, so that we can connect these customers more quickly, we\u2019re expanding that effort because we definitely want to keep up with the expansion that\u2019s occurring. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s ahead of expectations in the areas and it\u2019s probably at expectations than others.","Brian Tierney","Stephen, one of the things that we saw last year was lot of the shale gas load that we expected to come on earlier in the year last year did not come on until later in the year. And whether that\u2019s logistics problems, permitting problems or whatever it was, it was stacked up and really didn\u2019t come in until later last year, earlier this year.","As we\u2019re looking forward, our shale gas related forecasts are actually increasing from the base that we had. And as we look to the end of the decade, we just had to increase our load forecasts for those regions by 20% given some updates that we\u2019ve had on some of the developments in those areas.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just wanted to speak about that increase in the supply, we\u2019ve seen a lot of volatility in local gas prices. Do you have a point of view on the impact, either near-term or long-term, just on all this increase in shale gas and what that might mean for local gas prices versus what we might see quoted on Henry Hub?","Brian Tierney","Yes, we\u2019re seeing some pretty significant basis differentials around our combined cycle gas plants. Waterford for instance which takes off with Texas Eastern and Zone M2, has frequently been trading at a significant discount to Henry Hub with our Lawrenceburg plant, which is on Texas gas translation zone 4 is frequently trading at $0.25 premium to Henry Hub.","So, even in our own service territory, areas that are not that far apart, Indiana to Eastern Ohio, we\u2019re seeing some pretty significant basis differentials.","When you\u2019re in the production area and you don\u2019t have the infrastructure to take the gas out of the production area, we\u2019re awash in gas and its depressing prices in places where you don\u2019t have those constraints and you\u2019re pulling from the Gulf, you\u2019re trading at a traditional premium to the Henry Hub. So, it\u2019s impacting local prices pretty significantly at our service area.","Nick Akins","Little caution on that, when you look at the volatility of processing, it\u2019s a matter of perspective how much of the processes are coming off. It\u2019s still hard in our coal prices and when you look at the retirements that are about to occur next year, you really wonder what it\u2019s going to do to natural gas prices going forward.","And even it depends on even more with the Clean Power Plant, it\u2019s \u2013 it will be amazing to see what the affect could be because I think the price is moving around in a relatively thin volume level. So you see storage creeping up a little bit, well, it wouldn\u2019t take a hot summer, we\u2019d lose storage if there is a hot September.","But when you retire generation, particularly that\u2019s running as much as that generation is running, it\u2019s going to move the natural gas and I would probably expect energy processes move up as a result.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks much for the color. I appreciate it.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Brian Tierney","Good morning.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Not to specifically ask about M&A, but there is, in Texas, a utility that looks like it\u2019s for sale, potentially, and you guys are in Texas. But, also, you made some comments in your opening statement about potential M&A and what you were looking for, and I\u2019m just sort of wondering about the potential deployment of leverage and whether or not you see opportunities such as Encore or what have you?","Nick Akins","Yes. So, I guess first of all the patent M&A 101 answer, we look at a lot of things. But certainly when you make a decision like that it continues to be more of a strategic move. And with the amount of transmission spend that we have available to us with like I said with no premium. And I fully expect the Texas process to be pretty robust.","It remains to be seen how that process is actually going to work out. And in fact, who all is involved with it. But our course of action is what we know today. And that\u2019s focused on the transmission investment that we have indigenous that we can continue to improve earnings per share for our shareholders.","And anything else beyond that would have to be something that achieves a strategic hurdle that overcomes the transmission spend, and that\u2019s a hard thing to do these days.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then I just wanted to turn back to sort of Ohio and this PPA rider. And just sort of generically speaking, what the interaction you guys are having, generally speaking with officials in Ohio and their thoughts about fuel diversity, what the market is providing them?","And their appetite or their policy perspective on potentially going for something like the PPA rider or what have you, sort of a hybrid situation, in terms of if they want to have more fuel diversity or what have or if they\u2019re willing to sort of just go pure market kind of thing? Just what kind of, incrementally, what have you been getting from, as you get further in the process from the officials in Ohio?","Nick Akins","I think there is legitimate concern. What happens, I think probably the \u2013 you already have a test case out there with the ESP filing that we made last December that has a PPA for the OVEC generation. The staff recommended against it but they said well, commission, if you decide to do this, this is how to do it. So, basically they plan into the commission.","And it will be a matter of the public policy in Ohio what the result winds up being. But that would be a clear indicator and you probably would see more of that as we go forward. Because there is a huge amount of generation out there that is at risk. And from an Ohio perspective, it needs to be locked in, in some fashion. Now that might not be all of it but certainly just as you do with any other portfolio, there needs to be a long-term approach.","And for Ohio, it depends upon PJM market conditions to preserve some sense of lack of volatility for customers. That would be a huge error. So, we continue to have discussions and there are obviously others like industrials you\u2019re concerned about it, from an economic development perspective in Ohio. There is concern about from that perspective. And we\u2019ll continue to save the tree on that. And I think that\u2019s important for us to progress. So I\u2019d see that playing out this year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Any sense of any sort of timing, I mean, you said this year, but I\u2019m just wondering, do you think, is it going to be just basically, should we just check out the ESP process or do you think there might be another way this might manifest itself?","Brian Tierney","Well, I think certainly the ESP case is a clear indicator because that may be the first thing that the commission actually deals with. But there could be other filings that we would make as a result as well.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Nick Akins","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Thank you. Good morning.","Nick Akins","Good morning.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","I wanted to clarify a couple of points. First, on the transmission side, so, on the slide that you all lay out for us, the base case and the high case. So, just to be clear, if I look at the 2016 numbers, you still have about a $0.06 differential earnings-wise between base and high. So does some of the incremental investment that you\u2019ve made capture that, or when should we see that $0.06 starting to get captured visibly from our side?","Nick Akins","Yes, so you should, you should it\u2019s inclusive in that. And you should see that rolling through when the projects are completed.","Brian Tierney","With a very short lag that we have on translation spend if we make incremental this year, you\u2019ll start to see that in earnings next year.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","I see. Okay. Secondly, on your Ohio thinking, Nick, as you laid out various milestones, etcetera. Is it still a scenario for you to look at that portfolio and think of either a tax-free spin-off, or a sale to unlock some equity value? Is that still something you\u2019re considering, or is the focus primarily on trying to make it, as \u201cyou\u2019d really like as possible\u201d?","Nick Akins","I think all those options are still open because we have to credibly look at this business, do everything we can to fortify the value of it. And the make decisions about what the optionality is concerning that set of businesses.","And I think I mean, we\u2019re looking at that in terms of maximizing shareholder value and you have to look at all the options when you do that.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. If I heard you right, the EEI is probably not the forum where you\u2019d give us your strategic conclusion, but maybe year-end earnings for next year, would that be the time frame we should be looking at?","Nick Akins","Well, I certainly would be hesitant to talk about the timing of that. I doubt that we\u2019ll be saying anything about the disposition of our decisions on those particular assets at that point in time. November would really be a time where we focus on the guidance for the forward looking years. So, you\u2019ll see a new version of that.","But in terms of \u2013 in terms of the end regulated generation, we\u2019ll have to see how the processes are moved through in Ohio and other areas.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. Last question, can you just remind us for budgeting and planning purposes, what is the weather-normalized load growth you assume for this year and normalized longer-term?","Nick Akins","Yes, so when in our budget for this year, we were assuming negative 1.1% including format and excluding format positive one tenths of a percent. Obviously as we\u2019ve come in hotter for the first half of the year, weather normalized we would be off those numbers today. And we generally don\u2019t reforecast what the individual components going into the guidance once we get into the year.","We had been forecasting negative five tenths of a percent to positive five tenths of a percent in our guidance. And we will be revisiting that as we work our way towards putting together more formalized guidance at EEI.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Thanks Brian, thank you.","Brian Tierney","Thank you. We probably have question time for one more question operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks guys. I\u2019ll make it quick since you\u2019ve answered a lot of, just stopped by. I wanted to ask the \u2013 looking at one of your slides, year-to-date you\u2019ve put 36% of your volumes at the Generation Resources business into the spot market.","Obviously you\u2019ve done very well because we had a lot of volatility in the first and second quarter but prices are off quite a bit. Did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve in the second quarter to hedge out better prices, some of your load for next year or do you expect to run substantively open again?","Nick Akins","Yes, they\u2019re continually hedging in the market. And really those hedges have continued to be of benefit to us.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","And my question is, did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve that kind of \u2013 that have since fallen off precipitously to change the mix of what you might be putting into the spot market next year?","Brian Tierney","Greg, we\u2019ve taken some advantage of that. But a significant portfolio of that portfolio is going to be open to spot markets going forward, probably in that 30% to 40% range.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thanks guys. Take care.","Nick Akins","Yes, okay.","Operator","Thank you. And please go ahead with any closing remarks.","Julie Sherwood","That\u2019s all.
